It\u2019s called Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness by Peter Godfrey-Smith.", "All the book reviews on this book I\u2019ve read focused on how intelligent Octopus is. It makes sense since Octopus is the main character of the book, but I want to talk about something else. One thing I want to share is how some concepts in the book oddly reminds me of the concepts in computer science. For example, the way that Octopus\u2019s left and right brain communicate reminds me of XG bosting\u2019s optimization. And theories of our own memory system reminds me of data structure.", "Another one is about the topic of subjective experience, something I have a deep interest in. The author had a very interesting discussion about what is the subjective experience. For example, why do we think it is different when we see a color compare to a robot sees a color. I will use the example of octopuses to introduce this topic, because octopuses, the master of camouflage and can change even more colors than chameleons, are colorblind. How do they do that? Do they \u201csee\u201d a color? In the end, I also want to discuss if robots can also have subjective experiences one day.", "We all know that we have the left and right sides of our body, for example, the left brain and the right brain, or the left hand and the right hand. However, most of the time, we only refer to our brain as a brain because we do not get separate information from the left and the right side. We get one coherent piece of information from both the left and the right as a unity.", "But this is not always true in the animal world. In a study of using nine birds, eight of them do not transfer information between the left and right brain (Godfrey-Smith, 84). For example, if a bird learned a very simple skill with one eye masked, then the bird was being tested using the other eye only, the bird would not be able to do it. (Yea..)", "At first glance, you think this is crazy! But, animal researchers such as Giorgio Vallortigara pointed out that it actually makes sense. Different tasks need different kinds of processing, so it might be best to have specialized sides and not tie them too close to each other (Godfrey-Smith, 85). What about octopuses?", "Octopuses are between birds and us. Some information does get across but not always and the process is not so easy and simultaneously like ours. In addition, octopuses also have lots of neurons spread across their body. This means that the arms of the octopuses can see, feel, and think\u2026", "So this is how it works: the arms of octopuses can do things as they (the arms) wish without any orders from the brain. And the brain might not know what the arms touched or learned. And, if the brain wants to work together with the arm, it sends signals to the arms and hopes the arm will cooperate. However, when octopuses are alert or under some circumstances, it appears that the brain can control the arms really well. The whole octopuses work together as a unity just like us.", "I like the analogy the author gave in the book. Imagine our relationship with our breath. We can control our breathing when we want to but very often, we don\u2019t notice what they are doing.", "And how does this relate to the XG boosting algorithm?", "Well, a lot of people compare our brains to machines. And we know that our brains, which can process large information fast, have very high computational powers. To have such power, the brain has 86 billion neurons, the most among the primates, and it consumes 20% of our body\u2019s energy. It is an expensive machine, and most other animals\u2019 brains cannot afford such power. Thus, they find a way to optimize the operation.", "Putting this into the context of algorithms, one way to find the optimal solution is using the brute-force algorithm. This algorithm is in contrast with the greedy algorithm. The algorithm guarantees a global minimum, something a greedy algorithm cannot guarantee, but it is slow and requires high computational power.", "A decision tree uses a greedy algorithm and often encounter the problem of overfitting. XG Boosting, though is a tree-based algorithm, does not suffer from this issue because it actually uses a brute-force algorithm. However, it still runs efficiently even when it comes to large datasets. Because it actually uses semi brute-force. I\u2019d like to call it selective brute-force because it runs a brute-force algorithm on selective samples. (more info: XGBoost Part 4: Crazy Cool Optimizations)", "This is how I connect the animal world with the three algorithms. Our brain is like the brute-force algorithm. It automatically does lots of computation and finds the best solution. Other animals\u2019 brains that have lower computational power are like tree algorithms. Each side of the brain, or for each different type of problem, it builds a tree algorithm to solve that particular problem.", "When it comes to octopuses, they are like an XG boosting algorithm with lots of optimization tools built-in. They only pass some information and they consciously pass more information if needed. In this way, the brain requires less computational power but is still pretty intelligent. And you know what it reminds me when I read octopuses\u2019 arms can think? That\u2019s XG boosting\u2019s parallel learning\u2026", "The book talked about the model of working memory, a famous work by British psychologists Alan Baddeley and Gramham Hitch. The model proposes that working memory is a short-term store of a few items of information. We use this information when we need to perform conscious thinking/system-2 thinking.", "Some of you might be more familiar with the phrase short-term memory (STM). STM and Working Memory are both referring to memories that are not stored in long-term memory. STM only emphasizes the storage of information, but the Working Memory framework focuses on how we actually use this information. So roughly speaking the Working Memory framework covers a wider range. (more info: About the Distinction between Working Memory and Short-Term Memory)", "In the Working Memory framework, there are 3 components: a phonological loop (P), visuospatial sketchpad (V), and the central executive, C. The P part deals with spoken and written materials. The V part deals with visual and spatial information. The C part is the control center that makes sure everything goes right. (more info: Working memory)", "From studies of short-term memory, we knew that our short-term memories store about 7 items. So, if you are trying to memorize 10 digit phone numbers, break them into 3 chunks: 123\u2013456\u20137890 (aha!)", "Recall any data structure that works in a similar fashion? It\u2019s HASH TABLEEEE!! (more info: Taking Hash Table Off The Shelf)", "Think about it this way: the 7 chucks of items that we can store in short-term memory are like the hash buckets. And one of the responsibilities of the Central Executive part is to make sure we do not have any \u201ccollision\u201d.", "Inside each bucket, we store information in the form of an array. This actually also corresponds to how our memory works when we want to recall something. Studies have shown that recall in short-term memory is sequential unless you already know its position in the sequence. Thus, to recall short-term memory, putting things in some orders is helpful (Page & Norris 105). It\u2019s just like searching an item in an array!", "The advantages and drawbacks of our short-term memory are also like an array. It is designed for searching because searching is quick but it is not for storing large memories. For storing large memories, another data structure, a linked-list can do a better job.", "Long-term memory behaves like a linked-list. Long-term memories are stored in different places of our brain, but short-term memories are mostly in the prefrontal cortex. To recall from long-term memory, it is not in sequence, but by association. That\u2019s why for people who lost their memories, it would be helpful for them to look at associated things from the past in order to recall.", "The storage space for long-term memory is still believed to be infinite. I wonder it is infinite because the space for long-term memory is objectively so large that we haven\u2019t found the limit yet? or it is because long-term memory can be sized differently, like a linked-list. Thus, the storage appears to be infinite. (more info: What\u2019s a Linked List, Anyways [Part 2])", "You might be wondering why I am talking about the memory system while the book is about octopuses? It is because the author was trying to understand why octopuses keep changing their colors for no obvious reasons. For example, when they were completely alone. And he suspects it was a similar idea to humans\u2019 talking to ourselves.", "Having a working memory is what allows humans to hear ourselves when we are talking in our heads. This distinguishes us from the octopuses. Octopuses are believed to be lacking the capability of hearing to themselves. I will continue this discussion in the next blog, in which I want to talk about subjective experiences and higher-order thoughts.", "Your home for data science.
