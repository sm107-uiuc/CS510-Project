Data providers have already been offering text-mining products on their platforms and in-house research teams in financial institutions have been working on it for some time. NLP models could also get very complex in trying to interpret the words, phrases and numbers in a report.", "What would a number like 130 mean in this context? There are more negative than positive words, does this mean the paragraph has a positive sentiment? Positive for whom? Even after taking into account the context of the passage, a human reader might still be unable to make sense of what the numbers mean to whom, let alone a machine. This led me to think of another way in which we could systematically derive value from these reports.", "I came across comments on the echo chamber nature of market analysts which led me to an intuition that the biggest and earliest reporters tend to be able to move daily markets either directly or via the echoes of their reportings. Often at times, I get the impression that when a highly influential media outlet reported daily events that they viewed as important, the reports that came later in the day tended to sound very similar. The events that occured were definitely key drivers of markets but the reports themselves might be an influence in the market\u2019s momentum and mania.", "I thought this daily report from Bloomberg was representative of what I mentioned about. While it may not be fastest reporting of the individual events that happened the day before + overnight, I thought it was one of the most popular and fastest summary of events that I could access. What you might not have noticed was the published date & time of the reports.", "I noticed that Lorcan Roche Kelly was mostly the only person that was behind this report since April 2015. In fact, I discovered that it came up shortly after he joined Bloomberg Markets as an Editor.", "This got me interested in his publishing behaviour which led to my hypothesis and eventual trading signal.", "While there could be a 101 reasons for him to publish his report early or late e.g. had a rough night, missed the transport to work, had an annoying intern that wouldn\u2019t leave him early in the morning, I\u2019d like to believe in possibility of a signal first. Assuming that he goes about his daily routine over the years, I would expect that given an average day, if he had more events to cover over the course of the previous day or if he had to report a major piece that might require more fact-checking, he might take a longer time to publish the report. We could then use the time as a proxy to determine how volatile markets will be when it opens in reaction to the number or size of the news.", "The merit of this idea is that a position on volatility could be taken instantly and systematically from when the report is published. It is also not exposed to any deciphering of messages that could be an unwanted risk. Assuming that the report carries weight in the market, we could come in cheap before the momentum follows.", "Bloomberg is notoriously hard to scrape so I resorted to my quick hands to get the date and time of the reports. Please let me know if you have an alternative! I took the number of seconds from 00:00:00 UTC as my independent variable. I used yfinance to get the prices of the S&P500 and took a 10-sized rolling window standard deviation of daily returns as my measure of daily volatility, which is used as my dependent variable. Both the X and Y is then normalized.", "We can observe the recent black swans that saw volatility shot up to 8 SDs. I removed points beyond 3SDs and did a scatter plot. A simple regression result showed an R-squared of 0.02 and a t-stat of 5.075 for publish_time.", "The model is a simple linear regression of the 2 variables and it is used to predict the out-of-sample volatility using the publish_time of unseen reports. Out of convenience, I used the VIX Index and traded it as if it was a stock but you could use things from VIX futures to SPX straddles to capture more alpha from the timeliness and model costs. If the volatility z-score is predicted to increase from the previous day by at least 0.05, the model will buy the open and sell the close. Likewise if it is predicted to decrease by at least 0.05, the model will short it. Otherwise, no position will be taken.", "The entire dataset, including the COVID-19 period and the outliers, is split into train: 2015\u201304\u201301 to 2019\u201308\u201319 and test: 2019\u201308\u201320 to 2020\u201306\u201311. The model outperformed against a benchmark of holding long VIX throughout the test period. It produced a positive expected return but a negative sharpe due to a risk-free rate of 0.02.", "I have presented an original idea of observing the timeliness of daily morning market calls / reports to derive a signal on the daily volatility of markets. Even the use of current alternative data streams seems to be an echo chamber that is slowly losing its edge. I hope for this to be generalised to other data sources, used to trade in a variety of products, or complement the current use of alternative data in other ways.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
