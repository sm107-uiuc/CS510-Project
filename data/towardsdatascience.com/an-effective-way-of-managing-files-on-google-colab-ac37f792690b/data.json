In case you didn\u2019t know, Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. Most importantly, this does not require setup, and the notebook you created can be edited simultaneously by your team members \u2014 like how you edit documents in Google Docs. Colab supports popular machine learning libraries that you can easily load in your notebook.", "Actually, I started using Google colab in 2018 when I was in college, but at that time it was still very complicated to access the data even from google drive. Finally, because out of frustration I decided to use a computer lab even with far lower specifications.", "But when I tried it at the end of 2019 when my friend recommended it. From there, I realized that now access to data, etc. has become easier, and I will share my knowledge with you.", "Google Colaboratory or Colab allows you to write and run Python in your browser, with:", "And one more thing, Google will provide additional RAM if the current RAM is not enough. Based on my experience at that time, I was extracting Wikipedia data, then it crashed because of full RAM. Then Google offered to add ram from the original 12 GB to 25 GB.", "Google Colab has a \u2018maximum lifetime\u2019 limit of running notebooks that is 12 hours with the browser open, and the \u2018Idle\u2019 notebook instance is interrupted after 90 minutes. In addition, you can have a maximum of 2 notebooks running simultaneously.", "If you close the notebook window and open it while the instance is still running, the output and cell variables will still be present. But if the notebook instance has been recycled, your output and cell variables are no longer available.", "However, Google Colab can be annoying if you have to upload a dataset or model every time you use Google Colab. Maybe you don\u2019t mind if the file size is small enough, but it will be a problem if the size of the dataset or model file you upload is large enough plus your limited internet connection. Here I give tips for dealing with these problems.", "The first way that can be done is to mount it with Google Drive. So the data that you will use or have used are stored in Google Drive. To mount Google Colab with Google Drive is to use the code below that will prompt for an authorization code.", "The lines of code will return the link to get the authorization code. Click on the link, and you will get the authorization code. Then copy that into the prompt and press Enter.", "All files and folders in your Google Drive will be accessible from the folder called \u201cMy Drive\u201d.", "It is more efficient if you use zip, but because it can compress smaller file sizes, it is also useful if the file contains a collection of images. You can use the unzip command in Colab to unzip files begins with \u2018!\u2019 (exclamation mark). The exclamation mark is used for executing commands from the underlying operating system.", "If you are going to do long training times, it is strongly recommended to use a checkpoint and save it on google drive.", "If you can\u2019t use Google Drive because the storage drive is full. You can also use git as storage. For example you can use Github. Github has a limit of 100 GB per repository and 100 MB per file. When compared with the free version of Google Drive which only provides 15GB storage.", "To clone a git remote, you can do it with the git command in general by adding the exclamation mark at the beginning. For Example:", "If you want to push to git remote, there are several configurations that must be done.", "First of all, is to initiate the git repository.", "Then, set global email and username.", "And this is the most important line, when we add git remote origin, we have to pass our Github credentials.", "The Google Colab machines are built on Debian based Linux, therefore the simplest way for downloading data over a network is wget. You can upload the file somewhere, after that you can download from the cell code notebook and use this shell command: wget.", "For example if you want to retrieve wikipedia data. You can directly download it to your Google colab by using the following command.", "If you want a more complete explanation of how to deal with files in Google Colab, you can visit the following link.", "Your home for data science.
