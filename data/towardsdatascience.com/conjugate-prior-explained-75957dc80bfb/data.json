Such a prior then is called a Conjugate Prior.", "It is always best understood through examples. Below is the code to calculate the posterior of the binomial likelihood. \u03b8 is the probability of success and our goal is to pick the \u03b8 that maximizes the posterior probability.", "A question to you: Is there anything that concerns you in the code block above?", "There are two things that make the posterior calculation expensive.", "First, we are computing the posterior for every single \u03b8.", "Why do we have to calculate the posterior for thousands of thetas? Because you are normalizing the posterior (line 21). Even if you choose not to normalize the posterior, the end goal is to find the maximum of the posteriors (Maximum a posteriori). In order to find the maximum in a vanilla way, we need to consider every candidate \u2014 the likelihood P(X|\u03b8) for every \u03b8.", "Second, if there is no closed-form formula of the posterior distribution, we have to find the maximum by numerical optimization, such as gradient descent or newtons method.", "When you know that your prior is a conjugate prior, you can skip the posterior = likelihood * prior computation. Furthermore, if your prior distribution has a closed-form form expression, you already know what the maximum posterior is going to be.", "In the example above, the beta distribution is a conjugate prior to the binomial likelihood. What does this mean? It means during the modeling phase, we already know the posterior will also be a beta distribution. Therefore, after carrying out more experiments, you can compute the posterior simply by adding the number of acceptances and rejections to the existing parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 respectively, instead of multiplying the likelihood with the prior distribution. This is very convenient! (Proof in the next section.)", "As a data/ML scientist, your model is never complete. You have to update your model as more data come in (and that\u2019s why we use Bayesian Inference).As you saw, the computations in Bayesian Inference can be heavy or sometimes even intractable. However, if we could use the closed-form formula of the conjugate prior, the computation becomes very light.", "When we use the Beta distribution as a prior, a posterior of binomial likelihood will also follow the beta distribution.", "What do the PDFs of Binomial and Beta look like?", "Let\u2019s plug them into the famous Bayes formula.", "\u03b8 is the probability of success.", "x is the number of successes.", "n is the total number of trials, therefore n-x is the number of failures.", "The prior distribution P(\u03b8) was Beta(\u03b1, \u03b2) and after getting x successes and n-x failures from the experiments, the posterior also becomes a Beta distribution with parameters (x+\u03b1, n-x+\u03b2).", "What\u2019s nice here is you will know this analytically without doing the computation.", "The Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial and geometric distributions (seems like those are the distributions that involve success & failure).", "This is why these three distributions (Beta, Gamma and Normal) are used a lot as priors.", "An interesting way to put this is that even if you do all those experiments and multiply your likelihood to the prior, your initial choice of the prior distribution was so good that the final distribution is the same as the prior.", "Conjugate prior P(\u03b8) in an equation:", "You can still find the maximum without normalizing. However, if you want to compare posteriors from different models, or calculate the point estimates, you need to normalize.", "Your home for data science.
