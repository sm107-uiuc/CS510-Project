We must embrace and manage knowledge\u2026 | by David Bosak | Medium", "h1": "Human-AI alignment challenge", "description": "Information and knowledge is the new strategic resource that drives economic growth and we must embrace and manage knowledge that is created both biologically by neurochemistry and artificially by AI."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Our society is transforming, people are empowered, and we see effects of globalisation and increasing social interactions, which all have profound effect on the way that business is done. We\u2019ve learned to listen to those individuals with knowledge and great ideas, support them and collaborate with them regardless of their race, gender, financial or social status. Various knowledge sharing concepts are emerging such as wisdom of crowds, collective intelligence, open innovation, crowd sourcing, open source science etc., that further encourage information and knowledge creation and sharing. This drives imagination, creativity, speed, and delivery of even most complex technologies. Empowerment, globalisation, and increasing social interactions increase the chances that some individuals in any part of the world will spark an idea that will later disrupt the market. But also increase the chances that some individuals within your organisation hold information or knowledge that may be used strategically to grow. All of this shows that we are transitioning into a knowledge based economy, but what does it really mean? Here is the most pragmatic and concise explanation I can give.", "Information resides outside of human mind and can be generated without our direct influence (e.g. engine sensors create information). Whereas knowledge is a pattern recognition in the information given to us, and is human centric residing only in our minds making us simultaneously the creators, carriers, conveyors and users of knowledge. Knowledge is subjective and makes us both unique and competitive, and is used as a strategic resource to maximise our self-interest and personal welfare. Thus, sharing of knowledge involves complex emotion driven mechanisms that can be stimulated with trust, pay, promotions, bonuses, reputation, respect or prestige.", "Patterns (i.e. knowledge) originate in the minds of individuals who are empowered to think, reason, and act differently.", "Exposing yourself to information makes you discover patterns, how quickly you do that is dictated by your intelligence and a number of times you do that builds your knowledge. Thus, everything that you know and all your experience is fundamentally based on your brain\u2019s ability to recognise, memorise, or modify patterns. And when sharing with others, the knowledge in your mind becomes the information for someone else upon which further patterns can be drawn. There is a parallel here with Shannon\u2019s famous Information Theory which says that it is the element of surprise that dictates the amount of usefulness of information \u2014 e.g. someone sharing knowledge with us that we already know is of limited surprise and use, but if it is indeed surprising its potential usefulness grows in proportion.", "For all these reasons knowledge is human centric and difficult to manage. However, we have discovered alternative and much easier way to manage knowledge which is outside of one\u2019s mind that is stripped of subjectivity and any form of emotions or feelings. By many regarded as one of the most important discoveries of humankind \u2014 we can now create useful knowledge using artificial intelligence. Max Tegmark in his internationally bestselling book Life 3.0 defines intelligence as the ability to accomplish complex goals. He writes that \u201chuman intelligence is remarkably broad and able to master a dazzling variety of skills, while machines currently outperform us in a small but quickly growing number of narrow domains\u201d. What this means is that machines are becoming increasingly good at discovering surprising patterns \u2014 thus creating and sharing useful knowledge without risk of emotions, feelings or subjectivity interfering with the results every time you look at it. An AI machine will not keep knowledge to itself because it doesn\u2019t like you, it will not share a bare minimum because it has a bad day, or it will not mess up with the results because it is involved in some form of politics.", "An AI machine will create and share surprising patterns (i.e. knowledge) and humans should be aligned against its quality, quantity, accuracy, and consistency.", "Measuring the impact of the human-AI alignment is an important consideration, which requires a scientifically enforceable definition of intelligence.", "Information and knowledge is the new strategic resource that drives economic growth and we must embrace and manage knowledge that is created both biologically by neurochemistry and artificially by AI.", "Senior Engineer, GKN Aerospace.
