In 2016, Prudential Life Insurance announced a competition in Kaggle, inviting data scientists to come up with a risk assessment model. The foundation of this case study is based on the same problem space and uses data from Kaggle and data found using online research to demonstrate the data science process. The link to the presentation can be found here.", "Insurance companies are focusing on utilizing the power of big data and machine learning to come up with products that meet the needs of different customer and market segments. The below case study provides a synopsis of how Prudential Financial, Inc., one of the largest insurance companies in the US can utilize a robust data science road map to socialize analytics across the organization while solving their biggest bottleneck of coming up with a scalable risk assessment model for their customer segment. The case study analyses the data and business model implemented, size and scope of data storage and processing, provides a clear succinct assessment of data and software standards while validating the key analysis and statistical methods used.", "Customers in general experience a higher wait time for medical exams even after providing adequate and extensive information. The initial online quotation for any insurance plan is often inaccurate. The sales & call center teams have to rely on traditional methods to offer insurance quotes to its customers which is time-consuming. These factors turn off any customer forcing them to look for other alternatives. The business believes that revenue in the L&A segment can only be improved through better customer acquisition and retention. Since the effort required to acquire a new customer is much higher than retaining the existing ones, it is important to identify markets with high opportunity and reduce a customer\u2019s onboarding time (Kaggle, 2016).", "Prudential Financial, Inc. uses a segment market approach to develop products and offerings that can cater to a variety of customers and institutions. A value proposition is a key element of their business model that focuses on the accessibility of financial products, improved business integrity, strong ethics, and an enhanced brand image through improved customer relationships.", "Figure 1 below shows how the proposed objective of the project impacts some of the key business areas like customer relationship (through an improved quotation), insurance product development (by studying existing business and market share), marketing channel optimization, and customer acquisition.", "The scalability of the predictive model across other insurance segments owing to different customer characteristics and educating different stakeholders, sales, and customer engagement teams on the adoption of this model is challenging.", "Analyzing the data model is key to building the one-stop-shop for customer data while identifying the factors critical towards developing the risk assessment model (McKinsey & Company, 2017). Figure 2 below illustrates a conceptual view of how different data sources, the data quality management framework, and analytics can be integrated.", "Let\u2019s examine some of the key components of the data model below.", "\u00b7 Data Sources \u2014 Internal and External, includes data gathered over the website, product information, finance figures, call activity data (IVR calls by the customer and sales representatives), claims data from third party vendor, demographics information of the market, and external surveys", "\u00b7 Data Volume \u2014 20 million customers, cloud storage of 2.5 petabytes for internal data", "\u00b7 Data Velocity \u2014 Calls and Web data for L&A segment is updated daily, finance and product information are updated monthly, external data is procured quarterly", "\u00b7 Data Variety \u2014 Customer demographics, medical, employment, and family history. Data also includes sales, calls made, promotions, and events", "\u00b7 Data Veracity \u2014 Different standards in different places; DQM is used to ensure data quality", "\u00b7 ETL (Extract Load Transform) Tool \u2014 Teradata and Teradata SQL for web insurance application and call log data; Product and finance data is usually stored and circulated via Excel and ingested directly into info link storage (SAS datasets). External data procured from third-party vendors like claims data is stored as SAS datasets. The organization is planning to shift to Apache Spark for data generated over the web", "\u00b7 Analytics Tool \u2014 SAS & Python. SAS is used for data security purposes; Medical information is very sensitive hence the company is inclined towards SAS. Python (Jupyter Notebook) is used for model building", "\u00b7 Business Intelligence Tool \u2014 QlikSense and Power BI", "\u00b7 Processing \u2014 Analytics processing, data volume handling, and query optimization", "\u00b7 Capabilities \u2014 Models to support subsequent risk assessment and customer segmentation studies", "\u00b7 Security/privacy \u2014 Medical records and patient data requires privacy and confidentiality. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) governs data protection of health data in the US", "\u00b7 Lifecycle \u2014 Full data management required", "Figure 3 below illustrates how different tools and technologies can be utilized in Prudential Financial, Inc.", "1. Teradata \u2014 Relational database management system that stores data in a structured form making it easy to query by the end-user (Teradata, 2014)", "2. Apache Spark (Recommended) \u2014 Includes map-reduce capabilities. The schema-less design is distributed in nature and allows better ingestion of clickstream data. Cost of storage is much lower and allows for Cloud Native or on-premise processing engine", "3. SAS \u2014 Allows better data security and comes with analytical capabilities for predictive analytics. Most of the pharma and banking companies prefer SAS over any open source platform", "4. Python \u2014 Versatile and easy to use language with better machine learning and predictive analytics capabilities when compared to SAS. Preferred for model development due to the availability of multiple open-source libraries", "5. QlikSense/Power BI \u2014 QlikSense is a self-service business intelligence tool that uses in-memory usage to speed up the dashboard. Allows scripting for data wrangling and transformation with QVDs (Qlik View Datasets) allows faster frontloading of huge datasets. The basic version of Power BI comes as a bundle with the Microsoft package purchased by the organization and is used only for internal reporting", "The data analysis is divided into two segments. The first segment illustrated in Figure 4 below involves creating a 360 dashboard for business users to access the current market scenario whereas the next segment involves building the risk assessment model. All top-line KPIs involving customer base, market share, products available, revenue, and growth are displayed along with relative performance measures by geography and products in the Executive Summary page. The exploratory data analysis using QlikSense enables identification of business areas that requires attention at the same time incorporates the pre-work required for model development.", "Quick findings from the data analysis above:", "1. Prudential Financial, Inc. has a customer base of 22M but only captures 6% of the market share in the U.S.A", "2. The company has a better presence in the Western Part of the country majorly in the states of California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado", "3. Products D3 and D4 are the top-performing products of the L&A portfolio", "4. The company has customers from different age groups, with a positive correlation observed between age and risk levels (correlation check using Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient)", "Before model development, a high-level conceptual diagram is developed to identify factors that can contribute to risk levels. The conceptual diagram is illustrated in Figure 5 below.", "Prudential Financial, Inc. classifies risk into 8 major categories ranging from 1 to 8, 1 being an insurer with the lowest risk and 8 being the highest. The risk level is a multi class attribute hence a combination of decision tree and ensemble techniques are used to identify the model with the highest accuracy score. Ensemble signifies combining results from a group of models to achieve better accuracy and stability. Multiple algorithms were tried and tested to strike a balance between bias and variance. Data wrangling, missing value treatment, outlier treatment was done before model development. Central tendency and skewness are calculated for all attributes and missing values are replaced with 0s or mode. Boxplot and a combination of Inter Quartile Range are utilized to identify the outliers. The following algorithms (Analytics Vidhya, 2016) are developed before recommending a model to be deployed on the server as illustrated in Figure 6 below.", "1. Decision Tree \u2014 Supervised learning algorithm for classification problems useful for datasets with a higher number of categorical variables. Good for handling multiclass problems but often results in the model overfitting without pruning. Gini index and Entropy is used as the information gain criterion for splitting", "2. Random Forest \u2014 A versatile machine learning method that works with both regression and classification problems. A bootstrap sampling of data and a subset of features (independent variables) is allowed to grow multiple trees in a Forest. Data are classified into labels based on maximum voting. Random Forest works well with large data set with higher dimensionality and combines result from multiple classifiers to improve model stability", "3. Bagging \u2014 Similar to Random Forest except it utilizes all features to develop the tree", "4. Boosting \u2014 A family of algorithms that combines weak learners to create a strong learner. ADA boost trains different predictors sequentially to improve the output of the preceding predictor. ADA boost works by altering the sample weights of incorrect prediction for every iteration whereas Gradient Boost works by identifying large residuals computed in the previous iteration", "5. Grid Search CV \u2014 A technique to fine-tune model output by trying multiple ranges of model parameters. Uses a K-fold cross-validation technique to output the best parameters for an algorithm based on results from the K-Folds. Computation time is much higher if multiple ranges of parameters are used", "Figure 7 below displays the pair plot, precision, recall, F1, and ROC scores of the model developed using the Bagging Technique. The macro average scores are considered while comparing model parameters from different algorithms. Bagging had the highest accuracy of 0.56 and recall and precision scores of 0.42 and 0.51. The model results can be fine-tuned using k fold cross-validation or bootstrap sampling in the next refresh phase.", "Prudential Financial, Inc. is utilizing the power of data to make informed decisions. The data science space is currently a river of reasonable returns with behavioral science and design thinking opening ways to accelerated problem-solving through a holistic ecosystem of people, processes, and technology platforms. The risk assessment model and a 360 dashboard are the first of its kind that has the potential to unlock a 10M dollar value with 1/10th the cost of management consultants with days to come.", "4.
