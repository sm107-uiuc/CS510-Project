Here is a quick refresher of what we found:", "Last time I didn\u2019t have enough time to dig more deeply into the numbers. But after examining things in more detail, I discovered some surprising trends.", "First, the general stagnation in data science salaries on average over the past few years is really a tale of 2 trends:", "I realize that my list of \u201ctrendy\u201d tech companies is completely subjective \u2014 my criteria was, \u201cWould the average grad of a top engineering school be excited to work there?\u201d Regardless, check out the difference in trends:", "My guess is that there are two groups of companies \u2014 ones that have the ability to produce, gather, and extract competitive edge from proprietary data and ones that do not have it. Because the \u201chaves\u201d can get more value out of their data scientists, they are willing to pay them more as well. Meanwhile the \u201chave nots\u201d are much more likely to get frustrated with the lack of value created by their data science teams resulting in a lower perceived worth (and higher turnover).", "Companies like Google and Facebook have demonstrated that gathering and exploiting unique data can create a massive competitive advantage (and this competitive advantage expands over time as more data is collected and insights are gleaned). Their success with using data science to generate massive profits creates a virtuous feedback loop where data and research creates profits which are then reinvested back into more data and research (resulting in even greater future profits).", "So the lesson for aspiring data scientists is to work for a company that owns the type of unique data that grants a competitive edge. And a company that knows how to properly use that data to create a virtuous loop of research and profits.", "Here is a recent (2018\u201319) look at median data scientist salary by company. Remember, we are looking at only the data scientist job title and I filtered out companies that hired 5 or fewer data scientists during the period.", "Wow, look at Stitch Fix! That is a pretty penny especially when we remember that the $190,000 median figure represents just base salary and does not include bonuses or stock. More generally, the companies at the top are all data driven and either have massive amounts of proprietary data (AirBnB, Lyft, Facebook) or are building towards it through unique interactions with their users (Stitch Fix, Opendoor).", "Lastly, when looking at these differences across companies, it is helpful to remember that they are driven not just by the relative sizes of each company\u2019s bank account but also by differences in role and required expertise.", "Unsurprisingly, data scientist pay in the San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley) is higher than in other parts of the country (many of the companies in my \u201ctrendy\u201d tech group are located in Silicon Valley). The difference in median base salary shown in the chart below is probably understated as I focused primarily on the West Coast and other tech hubs \u2014 many low cost cities in the Midwest and the South were left out of my analysis.", "The difference in salaries between data scientists working in Silicon Valley versus other regions looks pretty significant. But unfortunately, the differences in cost of living (driven by sky high home prices and rents) is even greater.", "Making big bucks is great but we need to remember that expenses matter just as much. If we make big bucks but then we end up paying even bigger bucks to Uncle Sam (taxes) and our landlord (rent), then we may still end up a net loser.", "First, let\u2019s take a look at how data scientist salaries stack up by region (2018\u201319 salaries only):", "As expected, the San Francisco Bay Area comes out on top in terms of median base salary. New York salaries are less than I expected them to be \u2014 the likely reason is that my dataset is not capturing some of the data scientists employed by the big banks (where they are probably called quantitative strategists, risk managers, or portfolio consultants). Also, using just base salary probably understates the earning power of data scientists employed by the big banks as their compensation is weighted heavily towards annual cash bonuses (100% bonuses are not out of the ordinary).", "The one that really jumps out to me is Seattle. As a data scientist there, you are earning almost as much as you would in Silicon Valley, but you pay no state income taxes and enjoy significantly lower housing costs.", "Let\u2019s divide the median base salaries from the previous bar chart by median rents (multiplied by 12 to get annual rent) in each of those cities to get a rough proxy for how far your dollar goes (I left out the \u201cOther\u201d category as that includes multiple cities, but not enough to safely apply a national average). In case you are curious, here are the monthly median rents that I used (sourced from this article):", "And here are how the base salaries look when converted to units of rent-equivalents. Recall that I am taking the monthly rents and multiplying them by 12 in order to annualize them:", "Adjusted for rent, your data science salary goes a lot further in Seattle versus other tech hubs. And this is before we account for the fact that you pay lower taxes (no state income tax remember?) as well. So if you don\u2019t mind the rain, consider dropping a resume or two with Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks.", "Finally, let\u2019s check how the tech vs. no tech salary disparity looks across these regions (2018\u201319 salaries only). Seattle \u201ctrendy\u201d tech companies on average pay more as well, just like the Bay Area (Silicon Valley). The disparity in New York is especially large \u2014 my best guess is that non-tech NYC firms pay large annual bonuses, which would not show up in the H1B salary data.", "Before we call it a day, let\u2019s recap some of the key findings from our data:", "Hopefully this was insightful and useful to you.
