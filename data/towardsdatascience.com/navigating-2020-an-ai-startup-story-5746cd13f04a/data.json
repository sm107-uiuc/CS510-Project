What many were hoping was a bad flu impacting only other corners of the world, turned out to be a global pandemic wreaking havoc in my home country, and on its way to Boston.", "Little did I know then, this was not only a matter of \u201cworking from home for a bit,\u201d but the beginning of a new phase in life, where all aspects of our business would need to be reconsidered completely.", "AI startups are not for the faint of heart \u2014 new tech entering new markets, seeking a repeatable business model. AI is far from being a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d and running a small startup competing with giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, is a challenge in and of itself \u2014 without a global pandemic to contend with.", "In March 2020, this became even harder. After founding Neurala, we began working with DARPA and NASA to design innovative AI able to run and learn on small compute hardware. We were learning every step of the way, so we entered 2020 with the conviction that we had found our sweet spot \u2014 the right product for the right market.", "After some successful proofs of concept, where we helped manufacturing companies deploy smart cameras to augment the human eye in spotting defects in products at staggering speeds, we geared up to launch our new software that would enable anybody \u2014 without AI expertise \u2014 to implement AI directly on the production line, without writing code, in minutes.", "Launching a product in March 2020 turned out to be problematic.", "The irony of a totally remote organization trying to launch \u2014 for the first time \u2014 a product intended for installation on premise, was not lost on us. Our customers, manufacturers in countries like Japan and Italy, were shutting down in rapid succession, with no re-opening in sight. Without the ability to travel, meet with customers, and troubleshoot the software, we decided to \u201chibernate\u201d. We all took pay cuts to preserve jobs, set up our offices in our Boston homes to focus on product development, and feverishly geared up for a later launch.", "Those were tough months. For many, work challenges were compounded by family obligations (i.e. managing young children who were also home from school). With my wife, co-founder and COO of the company we founded, we have four children ranging from 1 to 9 years old, so the difficulties were not lost on us. But we persevered and remained laser-focused on the road ahead. As a team, 100% of our activities converged on our product launch which we successfully completed in June.", "By that time, something unexpected happened. At no point in my 25-year-career in AI had I felt such a turn of the tide on the dialogue around AI, robotics and automation. Instead of \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid you are building Terminator?\u201d, the questions I was being asked were more along the lines of \u201cWhen do you think we can get enough AI to help solve this pandemic?\u201d   It was as if, all at a sudden, there was a collective realization that the lack of automation and AI was actually hurting humanity at a time when these technologies were needed most. With factories unable to operate because of the lack of available workforce, and with automation nowhere near the level to be able to work without human supervision, companies were now asking when they could test our product and automate quality inspection in order to build and ship the products their customers needed.", "In the span of a few months, the demand for AI in manufacturing \u2014 and fortunately, our software \u2014 has grown to a point where we have decided it is time to re-open a Boston office. Despite anything positive bringing a strange feeling in 2020, in August we pulled the trigger and rented space to accommodate 10 people (out of 40+).", "My favorite definition of Einstein\u2019s relativity is: \u201cHow Long A Minute Is Depends On Which Side Of The Bathroom Door You\u2019re On\u201d. The past six months have definitely felt like an eternity to me, with each day filled with uncertainty dilating the sense of passing time.", "I believe these challenging days are the ones where people who bond around a common goal can rally and find a way forward that might not have been found in ordinary times.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I am the CEO of Neurala Inc., a Boston-based company that has deployed its advanced Artificial Intelligence software in tens of millions of devices worldwide."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
