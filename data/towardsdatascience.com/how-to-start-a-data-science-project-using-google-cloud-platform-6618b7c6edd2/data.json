Getting insights out of data", "2. Communicate those insights to your client", "Communication is crucial to almost every Data Scientist, and among all the ways to communicate, showing the code and visualizations would be the most direct and common way to do it. Same as most people in this field, I used a lot of notebook/markdowns for my Data Science Projects. Therefore, I am confident to say that a notebook style workflow, which enables you to see the all the results from code while writing new code, would be a great environment of doing a Data Science Project.", "GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is a cloud computing service offered by Google. For those of you that are not familiar with cloud service, it is basically using a network to connect to a remote machine that you rent, making computations on that machine and send back the result. It\u2019s just like car renting. Obviously, using a cloud computing service:", "1. Gives you a machine with better performance to do your computations. (If you pay enough, of course)", "2. Reduces the actual cost of doing the computation by renting instead of buying a super machine. (Just like car renting isn\u2019t it)", "3. Relieve your own laptop so you can play a video game while doing a heavy parallel computation.", "There are actually a lot of companies offering cloud services now. AWS, Azure, GCP, you name it. However, Google gives a $300 credit for anyone registered for the first year of use. With that, you can rent a simple instance for a whole year or try a monstrous one for a few days. Thereby, for anyone who is new to Cloud Service and not willing to pay before tried, this is the way to go!", "There should be an offer on the front page that asks you to activate your $300 trial. Put in your information and payment information (just for verifying that you are not a robot, there will not be a charge or subscription after you used up your credit), and you are good to go!", "If you are new to GCP, you should already have an automatic-generated project called \u201cMy First Project\u201d. You can change the project name later in project settings. If you prefer to create a new one, go with this tutorial from Google.", "Now select Left sidebar \u2014 Compute \u2014 Compute Engine \u2014 VM instances. You should not have any instances now, click create.", "Here you get to choose the API access and Firewall settings.", "Leave Service account to default, and select \u201cAllow full access to all Cloud APIs\u201d to save a lot of work setting up APIs whenever you are using a new one. In Firewall allows both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.", "If you click on the \u201cManagement, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy\u201d you can choose further settings. Normally you don\u2019t want to change any of these. However, you can choose to turn on Preemptibility in Availability policy. Preemptibility is just like a Spot instance in AWS:", "So, if you are doing a project that does not require running a few hours straight and fine with getting the work done in 24 hours, this is the way to save. Now that everything is set up, click on create to actually create your first GCP instance.", "First go to the Left sidebar \u2014 Networking \u2014 VPC network \u2014 External IP addresses.", "Under the Type you should find your new instance Ephemeral. Click on that and change it to Static, name it whatever you want.", "Now go to Left sidebar \u2014 Networking \u2014 VPC network \u2014 Firewall rules \u2014 Create a firewall rule.", "Name it whatever you want, choose \u201cAll instances in the network\u201d in Target, put in \u201c0.0.0.0/0\u201d", "in Source IP ranges, choose \u201cSpecified protocols and ports\u201d and put in 8888 in tcp.", "Now go back to Left sidebar \u2014 Compute \u2014 Compute Engine \u2014 VM instances. You should see your instance running, with a green tick in front of the name. Click the SSH button to connect to your instance, which will start a cloud terminal that automatically connects to it.", "If you prefer to connect to it through your local terminal, or a cloud shell, you will have to install gcloud and setup Google SDK then use gcloud compute ssh command to connect. You can go with this tutorial.", "We are using Makefile command built-in a Linux system to set everything up. You can create your own version of things and environments, or you can try my code as a quick start.", "First thing first, a plain Debian environment from GCP might not have complete essential tools and packages we need:", "Type in \u201cy\u201d when it prompts you whether to continue.", "Now do git clone to download my quick start code:", "You can check the download using ls command, and it should return only MyEnv that you just downloaded. Go to the directory MyEnv using cd command.", "Then run this three line of code:", "First make sure you are in the right directory, where you got your data ready, because you can not go to the parent directory once you start a Notebook. Secondly, make sure you are in the virtual environment, because all your packages were installed there: If you are in the environment, a (.env) should show up in front of your name.", "And return. Now the notebook is already running but you still have to connect to it yourself. Open your browser and type in the follow line, where <external static IP> is the one that displays on the instance page, without brackets, of course. This should bring you to the good old jupyter notebook interface.", "You can also choose to upload data directly within the instance interface using the upload button. However, I do encourage you to use Gcloud Storage Buckets to do the job since it can be easily connected to all your GCP projects.", "First, you need to click Create Bucket on the top of this page.", "Beware of the naming guidelines, since every bucket name has to be unique and all the names are publicly visible. For the Location, you should consider the bucket pricing as well as the location of your instance. (e.g. US-WEST1, US-CENTRAL1, and US-EAST1 have 5 GB free storage, and transferring data from bucket to instance within same region is free, see pricing details here), so that you can get the optimal setting according to your usage. I tend to leave everything else as default so that you can get the optimal setting from your everyday usage.", "After you created a bucket, you can upload your data from local to buckets by clicking the upload button in your bucket.", "Or using the gsutil function that comes with Gcloud SDK tools. The code format is just like cp or scp. Let\u2019s say you want to upload data.csv from your home directory to bucket:", "Now that you have the data in the bucket, next thing you should do is to connect to your instance, use the same gsutil function and transfer it to your instance\u2019s home directory:", "Now with step 6 you can open up your notebook, read data and continue to explore with your Data Science Project!", "Your home for data science.
