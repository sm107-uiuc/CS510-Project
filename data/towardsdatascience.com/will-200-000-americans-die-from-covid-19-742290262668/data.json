Such a dire prediction from the nation\u2019s foremost infectious disease expert has led many have been wondering: is this really possible? Is it the best or worst-case scenario? In this article, I will address these questions, and discuss the conditions under which this can happen.", "To obtain the number of deaths, we need two things: the range of case fatality rates and the number of cases.", "The CFR was calculated for each state in the US with at least 25 deaths (as of 4/1) using a cohort-based method that I describe in detail here. We combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t\u2080). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k, and t\u2080), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We then find the range of parameters that are within the top 1% of R\u00b2. By analyzing the Gaussian kernel density estimation (refer to Figure 3,4 here), I determined the most likely CFR estimate and the highest/lowest possible CFR\u2019s.", "Rather than use a model to forecast the number, we explore multiple total numbers of cases in the US by varying the depth of penetration within the population.", "Figure 1 reveals the number of cases per million residents for numerous countries. This is a reasonable benchmark for the number of cases that the US might experience in the near term. It shows that as the epidemic grows, it\u2019s plausible for the US to have as many as 2500 cases per million people (~825k cases), which is roughly three times the current amount. Note that most of these countries\u2019 outbreaks are continuing to grow and the final number of cases/million will be significantly greater.", "Furthermore, we can analyze the US\u2019s current trajectory. Figure 2 depicts the multiplicative factor of the 10-day growth of cases. That is, how many times has the number of cases multiplied in 10 days. In the past few weeks, it has decreased, which is a good sign. However, due to the nature of exponential growth, even low factors are highly dangerous; we are currently at ~4. At this rate, there will most probably be 2,000,000 cases in the US by March 1.", "For this analysis, I explored multiple ranges \u2014 from the current (as of April 1) of 210k to 21M cases.", "I first analyzed calculated the low, mid and high ranges for the different states that had at least 25 deaths.", "Figure 3 reveals the 10 states with the highest case fatality rates. This shows that Michigan, Louisana, and NY have the highest case fatality rates. Most states have \u201chigh\u201d CFR\u2019s less than 20%. On the low/mid-range, states\u2019 CFR\u2019s are primarily less than 10%.", "I multiplied the CFR\u2019s by the number of deaths under a number of scenarios to calculate the number of deaths. Table 1 shows the number of deaths that could result if the total number of cases will be 2x-100x more than the number of cases on April 1, under low CFR, the most likely CFR, and the high CFR.", "Referring to Table 1, let\u2019s see the conditions under which the US could see 100\u2013200k deaths. For this to happen, we\u2019d need at least around 2 million cases, which is about 10x the number we have today. But can we get there? Yes, at the current trajectory we will get there by the end of the month.", "If we get to 2 million cases, Table 1 tells us that we would see at least 73,000 deaths and as many as 203,000 on the higher end; Fauci\u2019s estimation will most probably play out.", "Reaching 200,000 deaths is probable if the US gets to 3 million cases. Most states have case fatality rates of roughly 10%, which is higher than that of Hubei Province, China. The next few days will be telling of how much worse this situation will become. I will update this analysis when things materially change.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
