The early 2000\u2019s Tech Bubble was obviously a bubble and as all bubbles are wont to do, it eventually crashed. This was also true of 1980s Japanese real estate, 2008 U.S. real estate, $20,000 bitcoin, weed stocks, etc. And in the years after the crash, historians focus on how obvious the risks were and how inevitable the eventual implosion was.", "The same goes for success stories. Michael Jordan\u2019s peerless success as a basketball player was basically preordained thanks to his unique and elite combination of athleticism and competitiveness. Google and Amazon\u2019s world-beating algorithms and execution meant that trillion dollar market caps were inevitable.", "I may be exaggerating for effect a bit, but a major flaw with how many people view history is that they do so through a deterministic lens. Part of the reason is that history is linear \u2014 there was only one sequence of events that led to today, and that sequence is the one covered in history books. History books don\u2019t delve into what-ifs such as what if Trump had lost to Clinton four years ago; instead, they focus (probably overly so) on what was and is.", "I\u2019ve often wondered why probability is considered required knowledge for data scientists. Day to day, I don\u2019t use probability that much \u2014 for my day to day work, I use statistics, matrix algebra, and machine learning much more. The answer I\u2019ve arrived at is: probability is important because data scientists need to learn to think probabilistically. Thinking probabilistically means recognizing that sequences of outcomes are not deterministic \u2014 rather each outcome is itself the product of a mixture of causation (or correlation) and chance.", "The table below visualizes the difference. Say we observed the following sequence of events (and observed it only once): A, then B, then C. The deterministic way of viewing the world would conclude that A lead to B, which lead to C. And in the future if we saw A again, we would assume that C is just around the corner. The pitfalls of thinking this way are threefold:", "On the other hand, a probabilistic way of looking at things recognizes that if A occurs (there is also a chance that A will not occur), then it might be followed by B or E (or other). And whichever occurs, B or E, could itself be followed by a whole range of outcomes. Thus, even though A -> B -> C was what we observed, that by no means implies that the next time we see A again, we should expect C.", "Rather, the thing that actually happened, C, could have been the least likely outcome of all. For example, a short while ago Hertz (a bankrupt company) stock was all the rage. Say I bought some Hertz call options (a levered bet on the stock) and was able to sell them a few days later for a handsome profit. Also for completeness, let\u2019s say that if Hertz stock gained 100%, my options would gain 300% \u2014 so if I bet $1,000, and Hertz doubled, I would net myself a profit of $3,000. After making money, my brain would probably experience the following thoughts:", "But that would be a mistake. I might even get lucky again and make money betting on some other crappy bankrupt company; but at some point, the chickens would come home to roost and I would lose everything. That\u2019s because I failed to honestly think about the probable range of outcomes, a.k.a. the cone of outcomes, of my Hertz bet (and neither did I think about what could have happened if I invested elsewhere). Instead, I focused too heavily on the positive result. A more realistic and holistic assessment would realize the following:", "We can draw a more realistic and complete outcome tree with probabilities (below). Now that we\u2019ve mapped out our likely range of outcomes, we can see how foolish my gamble was. I had a 5% chance of turning a profit and a 95% chance of taking a loss (since you lose the entire premium that you paid in the event that the option expires worthless). Moreover, because the options were so expensive (thanks to the volatility), the payoff from a huge move in my favor was just 3:1 \u2014 but based on the low odds of the move, I should have demanded a 20:1 payoff. The payoff is important to consider too \u2014 even if the probability of payoff is small, if the magnitude of the payoff more than makes up for it, then the expected value can still be positive.", "So in summary, no, I did not make a good investment at all, I just experienced a lucky gamble \u2014 definitely a case of luck masking a terrible process, which is not sustainable in the long run.", "It sounds very obvious when stated this way \u2014 so obvious you might think, who is foolish enough to think like that? But tons of people do so. The most glaring example that comes to my mind is when a certain president takes credit for the surging stock market:", "Every time he tweets about a record increase in stock prices or a new all time high, tons of people get suckered into the trap of thinking deterministically \u2014 they start to believe that the stock market must be up because the economy is doing well; and the economy is doing well thanks to the president. But they fail to recognize the following alternative sequences of events and equally plausible explanations:", "The right way to think about the future from an analytics perspective is to ask:", "If I were to play this out a large number of times, what is the likely range of outcomes?", "We should always think in terms of distributions, imagining the future as a cone (or whichever shape most reasonably approximates the distribution) of potential outcomes centered around the expected outcome of our action. Additionally, we also need to consider the cone of outcomes if the action were not taken. This is the principle behind controlled experiments like A/B tests \u2014 an experiment with a control group and an experimental group that properly isolates the factor (or action) that is to be tested.", "Controlled experiments are similar to simulations and allow us to repeatedly observe what would happen both if we take an action (the green cone from the picture above) and if we don\u2019t (the red cone). If our experiment\u2018s sample size is big enough, then we can get a very good sense of the range of possible outcomes, which allows us to properly evaluate both the expected effect of the considered action (does it move us toward a more desirable average outcome?) and the uncertainty around the action\u2019s effect (does it widen the cone and introduce excessive risk?).", "Unfortunately in the real world, we often don\u2019t have enough time or data to do this properly. For example, we will never know what would have happened had the Federal Reserve not injected so much money into the economy post 2008. We can only observe the single set of events that came to pass \u2014 so not only are we missing the red cone (the outcomes with no Fed money printing), we don\u2019t even get to observe the variance of the green cone (we just see a single green line). That\u2019s why academics and pundits can argue until their blue in the face whether quantitative easing and massive fiscal stimulus is truly effective or not, but the truth is no one really knows (while the Great Depression offers useful lessons, it is not a comparable control case to 2008).", "If it sounds tiring, that\u2019s because it is. Thinking exhaustively is exhausting! But the more we do it, the more it becomes habit or ingrained muscle memory. It improves our ability to analyze \u2014 and most critically, it improves our ability to evaluate processes independently of their produced outcomes.", "Good decision making (whether it\u2019s at the individual, group, or corporate level) requires a robust and repeatable analytical process. But every decision, no matter how astute, is still a bet \u2014 and even the most favorable bets are still subject to the whims of chance. By properly acknowledging the role of chance, we prevent outcomes from perverting our processes (or models). And by honing our ability to realistically anticipate the range of outcomes (along with the probabilities) that arise from taking an action (or not taking an action), we can make it so that even in an uncertain world, the odds are in our favor.", "Your home for data science.
