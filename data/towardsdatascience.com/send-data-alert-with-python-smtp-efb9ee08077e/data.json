From my working experience, most analysts would send the users business reports manually \u2014 they would process the data, run some validations, and generate reports to send via Outlook/gmail. All of these take much time and leaves rooms for human errors.", "What if we could automate the business reporting and alerts through the same Python Program which analyze our data.", "That would save huge amount of time and hassle!", "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) lets users send mail to another. When you push the mail from Python app, the users are receiving it through Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). These are the base for standard email interfaces such as Outlook and Gmail.", "SMTP allows the server to listen for email request through a TCP connection then send the email through port 587 (Data Flair).", "In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate email alerts with Python SMTP.", "We will visit our previous projects on Building Dashboard Web Application, with the task scheduler to web scrape data from Lazada (eCommerce) website and dump it into SQLite RDBMS Database. Based on the products that users are confirmed, we are going to check if the price drops from the original price and use it to generate alerts.", "Feel free to just enjoy this article or visit my Github Repo for the complete codes. Alternatively just scroll down and enjoy this article.", "For you who are not familiar with the Dashboard Web Application that I am referring to. I am building a dashboard based on the price changes on Lazada Scraped Products. Each time the user modifies the input dropdown, the app will alert the users if the price of the product drops.", "Our task is to assign a webhook which will send an email once you modify the dropdown parameters.", "Python smtplib is already inbuilt when you download Python packages. If you have it running, you could just import the smtplib as the following", "To activate the SMTP connection, you will need to insert your authentication credentials by replacing the tags as the following:", "There are 2 parts you need to consider when building the emails: email properties and email send request.", "In the email properties, you can set up:", "In the email send request, this is where the SMTP server is set up:", "Once you set up the properties, everything is set. You just need to run it. And\u2026", "Chances are you would encounter this error", "If you encounter this error and you have double checked that your username and password are correct, then you would need to open your Gmail Settings and Toggle on the Less Secure App Access Option. This will allow Python SMTP to access your gmail account and send emails on your behalf.", "Of course to maintain your gmail security, you could turn it off after you are no longer using this functionality.", "Finally, once you run your script. You will receive this email. (Noted that currently I am using my own email to test the application).", "Congratulations. You just send your first automated email send request!", "Now that we know that our alert works, let us setup the web hooks.", "Web hooks are a resource-light event reactions by a server-side app to notify a client-side app to trigger an event. In this case, we will setup Dash to activate the Alert Logic anytime users modify the the Dashboard\u2019s Dropdown. We will set an alert if there is price decrease in our product.", "The end result, we will have a specific email detail that list all of the product and price alerts which the users are concerned of.", "Remember the credentials from step 1?", "Let us put these sensitive information in a properties file where you can secure and configure easily.", "First let us create a Python Properties file called properties.ini:", "These are the private files which you need to protect and secure. To access this, simply use the Python inbuilt configparser library.", "You will first initiate a config parser, this will structure your properties into a tree dir to extract.", "Then you will read the properties ini file and extract your username and password just like how you extract an element from 2D arrays.", "Congratulations!! You have created your first SMTP within your dashboard. If you did it properly, you would be able to receive this result. If not, feel free to refer back to my Github Codes or post your questions here.", "Now set free and create your own Dash Dashboard and Python SMTP!", "If you need more examples and better insights of what Python SMTP can do.
