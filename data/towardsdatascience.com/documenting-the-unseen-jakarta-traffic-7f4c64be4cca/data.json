Pandito Pratama - Maulana Ichsan Gituri", "Asian Games and Asian Para Games have been finished. So does the policy that goes with them, odd-even policy. After long debates, criticism and talks in many urban transport discussions, until most recent discussion in ITDP Indonesia that invited Traffic Director of Polda Metro Jaya, Head of Jakarta Transport Agency, Head of Greater Jakarta Transportation Authority, and also the President Director of PT Transportasi Jakarta, this policy becomes a hot topic in the society and also ignites questions such as: Will this policy continued after Asian Para Games? If it does, will this policy use the same scheme as they do before? Does the policy really make the city move faster?", "First, to quantify the performance of the government policy, one must look not only from the private vehicle side but also from the public transport side. Because the public transport side is the one that the government could take action directly, and it could facilitate anyone due to its affordable price. Then, we must look at the widest transportation network to represent the all public transport in the road of Jakarta. (Commuter Line may have more passengers daily, but odd-even policy only occurs on road-based transport.)", "It actually begins with the spirit of documenting of what the people always see at the traffic on a daily basis without a well-organized data documentation.", "Take a look at the widest transportation network in Jakarta, Transjakarta. We call this system as Bus Rapid Transit. In short, the buses have a dedicated lane that makes them rapid. We can say that anyone in Jakarta knows that the bus could run separately with other vehicles, because they have the separator, and once you occupied the lane with your own car/motorbike you could get any fine, public know that not all of the lane has a separator. But do they really know about the transformation of the dedicated lane? Do they really notice about the expansion of the network? I and Maulana started this way to really make this Jakarta\u2019s giant be well documented.", "It was shown on the map that the network has grown rapidly for 4 years. As for now, Transjakarta is serving not only BRT services but also feeder services that can reach the road with smaller right of way (ROW). Given this fact, that Transjakarta not always has sterilized lane, the traffic in the arterial lane have a big impact on the Transjakarta\u2019s performances.", "Since Google Maps API only provides the traffic for the private vehicle, we cannot use it to asses public transport performance. Fortunately, every Transjakarta\u2019s bus already has a GNSS receiver (or people usually called it GPS, but GPS is the American version of GNSS, actually the signal that caught by the receiver could be from Galileo, the European GNSS, or Glonass, the Russian GNSS or even Beidou, the Chinese GNSS, thank me later for the trivia :p)", "We decided to collect the data from several days in the month of April and August. Why April and August? We identify that within April is a situation of Jakarta without odd-even policy intervention and in April we cannot find any unique traffic seasonal behavior because there is no Ramadhan and Islamic Long Holiday, and August is where the policy effectively applied after one month trial on July.", "The data was a huge amount of data, it contains millions of record daily. So spreadsheeting will not be a great idea to process all the data we had. We then use R to filter, normalize, and generate information we need. Filtering is needed because for this research, we decided to only include the data at the peak hour and bus in the corridor. So we clean up all the data that is outside the category. Unfortunately, the data was shifting for few meters at our first try on plotting them on the maps, therefore we need to normalize them first, so they can back right on track. Finally, we calculate the speed of every corridor in April and August and the result was quite surprising.", "If you are not familiar with Jakarta, here is the map that shows the traffic profile, and where actually the policy applied.", "Every corridor that has a direct impact of odd-even increase significantly in speed.", "The answer is, not all of Transjakarta corridors is separated from other traffics. Some of them are mixed traffic, some of them have several intersections and traffic light, and some of them become a victim of discretion policy by the policeman. So yes, the odd-even policy have a quite big impact on Transjakarta\u2019s corridor.", "In case you are wondering how the increased speed looks like, here we give you two examples of spatial visualization of odd-even policy effect.", "Okay well, are those above good news? Actually yes they are, one of the visions of any mass public transportation in the metropolitan area is to shorten up the travel time, increase the mobility of the citizen, and all the map above reflect those visions.", "Yes, we did look at the impact of this policy on the public transport side, we actually concern that maybe other sectors see this policy as a nightmare.", "Retail? commercial? Property? We believe this is not a zero-sum game, all those who affected may experience a big shock due to this is still new, but if the consistency and commitment are on that point, we believe we can adapt and forming the new normal which is a better one.", "But can we just appreciate first the bravery that the government has built up to make this become real? And now this policy is coming to an end, after this, the odd-even policy is still applied but not on a-day-night-long, starting on tomorrow until the end of the year, this policy only applied on morning-afternoon peak, but thanks god that they don\u2019t eliminate any road segments, still the same.", "Here we are just common citizens who try to quantify how a policy influences the lives of many people. That political support is needed to determine the progress of a city, and sometimes, these advances are not presented through speeches, but through the signing of a bundle policy file.", "Your home for data science.
