Named after Anthony Perkins\u2019 character in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1960 film Psycho, the AI was fed only a continuous stream of violent images before being tested with Rorschach inkblot tests. (Rorschach inkplot tests have the basic idea that when a person is shown an ambiguous, meaningless image, the mind will work hard at imposing meaning on the image. It is considered a personality test.) The imagery detected by Norman produced spooky interpretations of electrocutions and speeding car deaths where a standard AI would only see umbrellas and wedding cakes. The goal of the MIT researches was to prove that the method of input used to teach an ML algorithm can greatly influence its later behavior. The scientists argued that when algorithms are accused of being biased or unfair, such as the high-profile cases of Facebook news or Google Photos, \u201cthe culprit is often not the algorithm itself but the biased data that was fed into it.\u201d", "As concerns over privacy and data security on social networks grow, researchers from the University of Toronto have created an algorithm to dynamically disrupt facial recognition systems. Since privacy is a real issue at hand with facial recognition becoming increasingly better, this anti-facial-recognition system can benefit to combat that ability. Their solution leverages a deep learning technique called adversarial training, which pits two AI algorithms against each other. Two sets of neural networks were designed: the first working to identify faces, and the second working to disrupt the facial recognition task of the first. The two are constantly battling and learning from each other, setting up an ongoing AI arms race. In addition to disabling facial recognition, the new technology also disrupts image-based search, feature identification, emotion and ethnicity estimation, and all other face-based attributes that could be extracted automatically. Next, the team hopes to make the privacy filter publicly available, either via an app or a website.", "Motion-sensor cameras are increasingly being used to track wildlife across the globe, from tigers in India to aardvarks in Africa. But combing through the millions of images captured by these systems is a time-consuming task. Now, scientists have discovered that artificial intelligence is as effective as human volunteers \u2014 and much faster \u2014 at identifying species in these largely untapped photo repositories. In a new study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers, led by computer scientist Mohammad Sadegh Norouzzadeh at the University of Wyoming, tested whether a type of artificial intelligence called deep neural networks could correctly identify and count species, determine animals\u2019 ages, and classify their behaviors. They analyzed AI\u2019s capabilities using 3.2 million images from the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, which contains photos from 225 camera traps in Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park since 2011.", "Your home for data science.
