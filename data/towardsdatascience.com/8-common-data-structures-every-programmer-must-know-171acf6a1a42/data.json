Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.", "Data structures are being used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. Moreover, data structures come under the fundamentals of Computer Science and Software Engineering. It is a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering interview questions. Hence as developers, we must have good knowledge about data structures.", "In this article, I will be briefly explaining 8 commonly used data structures every programmer must know.", "An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.", "Inserting elements to an array and deleting elements from an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are fixed in size. If you want to insert an element to an array, first you will have to create a new array with increased size (current size + 1), copy the existing elements and add the new element. The same goes for the deletion with a new array of reduced size.", "A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.", "Let\u2019s consider the following terms regarding linked lists. You can get a clear idea by referring to Figure 2.", "Following are the various types of linked lists available.", "A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out \u2014 the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as \u201cstack\u201d because it resembles a real-world stack \u2014 a stack of plates.", "Given below are the 2 basic operations that can be performed on a stack. Please refer to Figure 3 to get a better understanding of the stack operations.", "Furthermore, the following additional functions are provided for a stack in order to check its status.", "A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out \u2014 the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as \u201cqueue\u201d because it resembles a real-world queue \u2014 people waiting in a queue.", "Given below are the 2 basic operations that can be performed on a queue. Please refer to Figure 4 to get a better understanding of the queue operations.", "A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting and searching, irrespective of the size of the data.", "Direct Addressing uses the one-to-one mapping between the values and keys when storing in a table. However, there is a problem with this approach when there is a large number of key-value pairs. The table will be huge with so many records and may be impractical or even impossible to be stored, given the memory available on a typical computer. To avoid this issue we use hash tables.", "A special function named as the hash function (h) is used to overcome the aforementioned problem in direct addressing.", "In direct accessing, a value with key k is stored in the slot k. Using the hash function, we calculate the index of the table (slot) to which each value goes. The value calculated using the hash function for a given key is called the hash value which indicates the index of the table to which the value is mapped.", "Consider the hash function h(k) = k % 20, where the size of the hash table is 20. Given a set of keys, we want to calculate the hash value of each to determine the index where it should go in the hash table. Consider we have the following keys, the hash and the hash table index.", "From the last two examples given above, we can see that collision can arise when the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. We can resolve collisions by selecting a suitable hash function h and use techniques such as chaining and open addressing.", "A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.", "Various types of trees have been developed throughout the past decades, in order to suit certain applications and meet certain constraints. Some examples are binary search tree, B tree, treap, red-black tree, splay tree, AVL tree and n-ary tree.", "A binary search tree (BST), as the name suggests, is a binary tree where data is organized in a hierarchical structure. This data structure stores values in sorted order.", "Every node in a binary search tree comprises the following attributes.", "A binary search tree exhibits a unique property that distinguishes it from other trees. This property is known as the binary-search-tree property.", "Let x be a node in a binary search tree.", "Check my articles below on 8 useful tree data structures and self-balancing binary search trees.", "A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.", "Let us see how we can represent heaps. Heaps can be represented using trees as well as arrays. Figures 7 and 8 show how we can represent a binary heap using a binary tree and an array.", "Heaps can be of 2 types.", "Check my article below on implementing a heap using the python heapq module.", "A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.", "The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.", "Two nodes are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.", "A graph G is said to be a directed graph if all its edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex.", "We say that (u, v) is incident from or leaves vertex u and is incident to or enters vertex v.", "Self-loops: Edges from a vertex to itself.", "A graph G is said to be an undirected graph if all its edges have no direction. It can go in both ways between the two vertices.", "If a vertex is not connected to any other node in the graph, it is said to be isolated.", "You can read more about graph algorithms from my article 10 Graph Algorithms Visually Explained.", "A cheat sheet for the time complexities of the data structure operations can be found in this link. Moreover, check out my article below where I have implemented a few common data structures from scratch using C++.", "Finally, I would like to thank Mr. A Alkaff Ahamed for providing valuable feedback and suggestions to improve this article.", "I hope you found this article useful as a simple introduction to data structures.
