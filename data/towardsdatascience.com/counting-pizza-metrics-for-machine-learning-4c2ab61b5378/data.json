Classification says whether something is something else: say whether an image contains a pizza slice.", "Precision and recall deal with quantifiable results for classification that translate into business models. There\u2019s no requirement to understand how machine learning actually works.", "Anyone that touches a business model which involves machine learning should understand these metrics. Founders, management, business development, and investors included.", "It\u2019s important for a decision maker to give the data science team the appropriate metric for the business model. And I hope to show you that anyone who can count can understand which metric to use.", "Say you want to diagnose a rare disease.", "Answers to questions like these fuel a business model. Precision and recall are the two respective answers.", "This article aims to give intuition for these important metrics. And intuition often comes best when we can put an image to a concept. So let\u2019s consider a visual example: how many pizza slices are in the picture below?", "Let\u2019s now assume we\u2019ve trained a convolutional neural net (CNN) to identify pizza in images. I won\u2019t tell you a thing about how it works, and that\u2019s okay! The CNN comes back with these results:", "The model predicted 5 pizza slices. It correctly labeled 3 pizza slices, and it incorrectly labeled 2 pieces of pie as pizza. It completely missed 1 pizza slice. Look over the image until you see where all four numbers match up.", "Let\u2019s now go over some terminology to dive deeper into how well the model did. Precision and recall tell us what kinds of predictions we get from a classification model. In the case of counting pizza, these kinds of predictions are:", "Or we can show these kinds of predictions with emojis! (Note: The pie emoji technically means anything that is \u201cnot pizza\u201d)", "The CNN correctly predicted 3 pizza slices that were pizza, so there are 3 true positives. It incorrectly predicted 2 pizza slices that were actually pie, so there are 2 false positives. And it missed 1 pizza slice, so there is 1 false negative.", "Let\u2019s now start figuring out how well the model did. Precision measures correctness. Here, correctness means:", "When the model says pizza, how often is it correct?", "Now let\u2019s introduce the formula for precision:", "So the precision is equal to 3 / (3 + 2) = 0.6. This means that when the model predicts something is pizza, it is correct 60% of the time. The other 40% of the time it incorrectly predicted pizza when it was actually pie.", "On the other hand, recall measures completeness. Here, completeness means:", "Out of all the actual pizza, how many slices did the model catch?", "Now let\u2019s introduce the formula for recall:", "So the recall is equal to 3 / (3 + 1) = 0.75. This means that out of all the actual pizza, the model caught 75% of all pizza slices. It missed 25% of all pizza slices, which is the one slice in the bottom-right of the image.", "Now we\u2019re left to the natural question: which metric matters more for business decisions? The answer everyone hates because it\u2019s so true: it depends.", "And the kicker is that precision and recall directly compete with each other. As precision gets better, recall tends to get worse. And as recall gets better, precision tends to gets worse.", "So if we want the model to never say pie is pizza (100% precision), it\u2019s going to miss more total pizza slices (less recall). This often happens in business settings where a bad decision has a significant cost. The motto for precision is:", "It\u2019s better to miss an event than to act on a bad event.", "And if we want the model to catch every pizza slice (100% recall), it\u2019s going to guess more pie is pizza (less precision). This often happens in business settings where missing an event has a significant cost. The motto for recall is:", "It\u2019s better to catch all events and sometimes be wrong than to always be right.", "Another common metric is the plain old accuracy. It measures the fraction of correct predictions, including both positive and negative predictions.", "Give caution here: this metric can be extremely misleading when working with class-imbalanced datasets. That basically means that there are far more of one type of thing than another thing. Say a dataset that contains 100 images of pizza, and only 5 images of pie.", "While it is generally used less often, there are times when using accuracy is justified. If a data scientist says a model reached 99% accuracy, ask what that actually means.", "After all, consider the case where 1% of people have a rare disease. A classification model that always predicts \u201cno disease\u201d will have 99% accuracy. However, such a model will never catch a case of that disease (0% precision and recall).", "Let\u2019s now consider the case where we care equally about precision and recall. We want the model to be both highly correct and complete (this can be quite difficult in practice). We can introduce another metric called the F1-score.", "The F1-score creates a balanced score between precision and recall. Basically, it balances the precision and recall by finding a value between the two, always leaning more heavily towards the lower value. The F1-score of the pizza classifier was 67%, leaning close to 60% precision than 75% recall.", "In most cases, the F1-score is desirable to make sure we have good precision and good recall. In some cases, it may not be necessary. Getting both high precision and high recall costs more time, resources, and money. High precision or high recall alone may work for a business model at lower cost.", "It is up to the people designing business models to determine when to use what metric.", "You don\u2019t have to be a data scientist to understand which metric to use. It just involves answering the following question:", "What results from machine learning will allow my business to prosper?", "Metrics provide quantifiable results that drive business models. Precision, recall, and F1-score form a strong foundation to understand the results of a classification model.", "I hope I showed you that anyone that can count can understand machine learning metrics. These are also some points I hope you may take away from this article:", "Your home for data science.
