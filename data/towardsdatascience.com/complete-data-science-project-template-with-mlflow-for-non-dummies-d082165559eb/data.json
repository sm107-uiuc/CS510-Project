This can get messy and Mlflow is here to make experimentation and model management significantly easier for us. It will also simplify model deployment for us. More on that later!", "You probably heard of the 80/20 rule of data science: a lot of the data science work is about creating data pipelines to consume raw data, clean data and engineer features to feed our models at the end.", "The data science project template has a data folder which holds the project data and associated schemata:", "Data scientists commonly work with not only big data sets but also with unstructured data. Building out the schemata for a data warehouse requires design work and a good understanding of business requirements.

On the one hand, Spark can feel like overkill when working locally on small data samples. But on the other hand, it allows for one transferable stack ready for cloud deployment without any unnecessary re-engineering work. It\u2019s also a repetitive pattern which can be nicely automated, e.g. via the Makefile.", "While version 1 of your model might use structured data from a DWH it\u2019s best to still use Spark and reduce the amount of technical debt in your project in anticipation of version 2 of your model which will use a wider range of data sources.", "For local project development I use a simple Makefile to automate the execution of the data pipelines and project targets.

Experimentation in notebooks is productive and works well as long code which proves valuable in experimentation is then added to a code base which follows software engineering best practises.", "My personal workflow looks like this:", "It\u2019s important to isolate our data science project environment and manage requirements and dependencies of our Python project. There is no better way to do this than via Docker containers. My project template uses the jupyter all-spark-notebook Docker image from DockerHub as a convenient, all batteries included, lab setup. The project template contains a docker-compose.yml file and the Makefile automates the container setup with a simple", "The command will spin up all the required services (Jupyter with Spark, Mlflow, Minio) for our project and installs all project requirements with pip within our experimentation environment. I use Pipenv to manage my virtual Python environments for my projects and pipenv_to_requirements to create a requirements.txt file for DevOps pipelines and Anaconda based container images. Considering the popularity of Python as a programming language, the Python tooling can sometimes feel cumbersome and complex. \ud83d\ude12", "The following screenshot shows the example notebook environment.

You can use the following commands as part of your project:", "Last but not least, the project template uses the IPython hooks to extend the Jupyter notebook save button with an additional call to nbconvert to create an additional .py script and .html version of the Jupyter notebook every time you save your notebook in a subfolder. On the one hand, this makes it easier for others to check code changes in Git by checking the diff of the pure Python script version. On the other hand, the html version allows anyone to see the rendered notebook outputs without having to start a Jupyter notebook server. Something which makes it significantly easier to email parts of a notebook output to colleagues in the wider business who do not use Jupyter. \ud83d\udc4f", "To enable the automatic conversion of notebooks on every save simply place an empty .ipynb_saveprocress file in the current working directory of your notebooks.", "As part of our experimentation in Jupyter we need to keep track of parameters, metrics and artifacts we create.

It provides a central tracking server with a simple UI to browse experiments and powerful tooling to package, manage and deploy models.", "In our data science project template we simulate a production Mlflow deployment with a dedicated tracking server and artifacts being stored on S3. We use Min.io locally as an open-source S3 compatible stand-in.

Therefore we treat our feature engineering in exactly the same way we would treat any other data science model. The aim of this example is to use two models using different frameworks in conjuncture in both batch and real-time scoring without any re-engineering of the models themselves. This will hopefully demonstrate the power of using Mlflow to simplify the management and deployment of data science models!", "We simply follow the Mlflow convention of logging trained models to the central tracking server.", "The only gotcha is that the current boto3 client and Minio are not playing well together when you try to upload empty files with boto3 to minio. Spark serialises models with empty _SUCCESS files which cause the standard mlflow.spark.log_model() call to timeout. We circumvent this problem by saving the serialised models to disk locally and log them using the minio client instead using the project.utility.mlflow.log_artifacts_minio() function. The following code trains a new spark feature pipeline and logs the pipeline in both flavours: Spark and Mleap. More on Mleap later.", "Within our project the models are saved and logged in the models folder where the different docker services persist their data. We can find the data from the Mlflow tracking server in the models/mlruns subfolder and the saved artifacts in the models/s3 subfolder.", "The Jupyter notebooks in the example project hopefully give a good idea of how to use Mlflow to track parameters and metrics and log models. Mlflow makes serialising and loading models a dream and removed a lot of boilerplate code from my previous data science projects.", "Our aim is to use the very same models with their different technologies and flavours to score our data in batch as well as in real-time without any changes, re-engineering or code duplication.", "Our target for batch scoring is Spark. While our feature pipeline is already a Spark pipeline, our classifier is a Python sklearn model. But fear not, Mlflow makes working with models extremely easy and there is a convenient function to package a Python model into a Spark SQL UDF to distribute our classifier across a Spark cluster. Just like magic!", "There are some gotchas with the correct version of PyArrow and that the UDF does not work with Spark vectors.", "But from an example it\u2019s very easy to make it work. I hope this saves you the trouble of endless Spark Python Java backtraces and maybe future versions will simplify the integration even further. For now, use PyArrow 0.14 with Spark 2.4 and turn the Spark vectors into numpy arrays and then into a python list as Spark cannot yet deal with the numpy dtypes. Problems you probably encountered before working with PySpark.", "We would like to use our model to score requests interactively in real-time using an API and not rely on Spark to host our models. We want our scoring service to be lightning fast and consist of containerised micro services. Again, Mlflow provides us with most things we need to achieve that.", "Our sklearn classifier is a simple Python model and combining this with an API and package it into a container image is straightforward. It\u2019s such a common pattern that Mlflow has a command for this:", "That\u2019s all that is needed to package Python flavoured models with Mlflow. No need to write the repetitive code for an API with Flask to containerise a data science model. \ud83d\ude4c", "Unfortunately, our feature pipeline is a Spark model. However, we serialised the pipeline in the Mleap flavour which is a project to host Spark pipelines without the need of any Spark context.", "Mleap is ideal for the use-cases where data is small and we do not need any distributed compute and speed instead is most important. Packaging the Mleap model is automated in the Makefile but consist of the following steps:", "Run the make deploy-realtime-model command and you get 2 microservices: one for creating the features using Mleap and one for classification using Sklearn. The Python script in project/model/score.py wraps the calls to these two microservices into a convenient function for easy use. Run make score-realtime-model for an example call to the scoring services.", "You can also call the microservices from the Jupyter notebooks. The following code shows just how fast our interactive scoring service is: less than 20ms combined for a call to both model APIs.", "The example project uses Sphinx to create the documentation. Change into the docs directory and run make html to produce html docs for your project.

The data science community would not be the same without the continued open source contributions of Databricks and we have to thank them for the original development of Mlflow. \u2764\ufe0f", "Therefore, an alternative approach to running MLFlow is to leverage the Platform-as-a-Service version of Apache Spark offered by Databricks. Databricks gives you the ability to run MLFlow with very little configuration, commonly referred to as a \u201cManaged MLFlow\u201d. You can find a feature comparison here: https://databricks.com/product/managed-mlflow", "Simply install the MLFlow package in your project environment with pip and you have everything you need. It is worth noting that the version of MLFlow in Databricks is not the full version that has been described already. It is rather an optimised version to work inside the Databricks ecosystem.", "When you create a new \u201cMLFlow Experiment\u201d you will be prompted for a project name and also an artefact location to be used as an artefact store. The location represents where you will capture data and models which have been produced during the MLFlow experimentation. The location that you need to enter needs to follow the following convention \u201cdbfs:/<location in DBFS>\u201d. The location in DBFS can either be in DBFS (Databricks File System) or this can be a location which is mapped with an external mount point \u2014 to a location such as an S3 bucket.", "Once an MLFlow experiment has been configured you will be presented with the experimentation tracking screen. It is here that you can see the outputs of your models as they are trained. You have the flexibility to filter multiple runs based on parameters or metrics. Once you have created an experiment you need to make a note of the Experiment ID. It is this which you will need to use during the configuration of MLFlow in each notebook to point back to this individual location.", "To connect the experimentation tracker to your model development notebooks you need to tell MLFlow which experiment you\u2019re using:", "Once MLFlow is configured to point to the experiment ID, each execution will begin to log and capture any metrics you require. As well as metrics you can also capture parameters and data. Data will be stored with the created model, which enables a nice pipeline for reusability as discussed previously. To start logging a parameter you can simply add the following:", "To log a loss metric you can do the following:", "Once metrics have been captured, it is easy to see how each parameter contributes to the overall effectiveness of your model. There are various visualisations to help you explore the different combinations of parameters to decide which model and approach suits the problem you\u2019re solving. Recently MLFlow implemented an auto-logging function which currently only support Keras. When this is turned on, all parameters and metrics will be auto captured, this is really helpful, it significantly reduces the amount of boiler-plate code you need to add.", "Models can be logged as discussed earlier with:", "Managed MLflow is a great option if you\u2019re already using Databricks. Experiment capture is just one of the great features on offer. At the Spark & AI Summit, MLFlows functionality to support model versioning was announced. When used in combination with the tracking capability of MLFlow, moving a model from development into production is a simple as a few clicks using the new Model Registry.", "In this blog post I documented my [opinionated] data science project template which has production deployment in the cloud in mind when developing locally.
