Today, technological advances and digital accessibility have surrounded us so much that it is unfortunately not very easy to keep our phone or laptop out of sight.", "I consider data science as an art of making a delicious meal. While cooking, you can add different ingredients or change the cooking style in order to reach new tastes or to enhance the flavor of existing ingredients. Similarly, while working with data, you can try different approaches and materials in order to reach the result. Just like the pleasure and happiness of eating, at the end of the day, if your final outcome does not taste delicious to you or your audience, you may feel like all the work you have done is useless. Most of the issues we talked about the data are not tangible and visible. As a matter of fact, you will find yourself in a continuous tour of persuasion. As you know, the most important point about \u201cData\u201d is to ask the right questions and to make the right order of possible answers.", "In order to capture the flavor as mentioned, before starting to work with the data, I usually ask myself the three questions below:", "When reading books, articles or any news, it is always hard for me to find the notes I wrote down, highlighted or underlined. After a while, it is inevitable not to remember all the information noted. Therefore, I thought I could develop a tool that sets up reminders for my notes at specific intervals, and thus improves my memory to hold them for a longer time.", "Perhaps there can be note reminder applications available on the market. However, I would like to develop my own note reminder tool.", "Obviously, I did not want to develop a tool which has a static structure with one-user management and one-time use. It was critical for me to have a flexible architecture so that everyone can modify and improve a tool according to their own benefit.", "Of course, it is possible to implement this feature through a mobile application. I am sure that many of successful application developers among you can easily do programming to add this functionality. However, what I want to achieve here is to prepare a nice meal with the ingredients I have. Also another crucial point for me is to achieve the maximum benefit with low effort by saving time and cost.", "For this purpose, I thought that I could use Twitter as a notepad.", "Ultimately, Twitter is a platform that can be used as a personal notebook depending on your purpose. I can even divide my notebook into sections without any difficulty thanks to Twitter\u2019s #hashtag mechanism.", "Well, can I make it sustainable?", "Yes, my notebook will continue to survive unless Twitter closes or my user ID is deleted from their database. In this way, not only me, but also other Twitter users will be able to use my notebook as a flood of information.", "Yes, hosting server was the main type of cost incurred in this work. However, since I already have a server, I do not have to spend extra money. Hence, I did not have any expense on this.", "Economics and financial markets have always been areas of interest to me. I enjoy reading a lot on these topics. Therefore, my first motivation was to convert my readings in economics into notes. The hashtag I set for myself on Twitter was #eko_kendimenotlar (eko: Abbreviation for Economy, kendimenotlar: notestomyself). Under this hashtag, I started to share my notes about my readings, and so as an initial step, I started to fill my data warehouse.", "Now I need to find a way to access my data warehouse on Twitter. Fortunately, the Twitter API has come to my rescue. By opening a developer account on Twitter, I was able to access my account via the Twitter API. I used the Tweepy package to access Twitter API and the Python as a programming language. In fact, what I wanted to do was quite simple:", "I coded first step in Python seamlessly but in the last part I did need to find a solution for:", "Sending notification to my mobile phone?", "I was initially planning to implement my idea as a mobile application. However, I do not have enough experience in this field, which will require more time and extra effort to learn it first and then implement accordingly. Therefore, I decided to use an additional service called Pushbullet. Pushbullet is a service provider to offer information sharing among devices easily for better synchronization. I used Pushbullet\u2019s service to push notifications to the phone, which significantly saves my time. Thanks to the Pushbullet Python package, I integrated the push command into my script and eliminated the problem of sending notifications to my phone through their mobile application. Here\u2019s my Python script I coded for this work:", "Now, I can reach my #eko_kendimenotlar hashtag on Twitter and send my notes to my mobile phone as a notification. Then, the next question arises: how could I automate it?", "At first, I thought of automating in Windows Task Manager or UIPath. All I had to do was to create the myscript.bat file and to redirect it to Task Manager and the UIPath automation robot. However, I did not want to be dependent on local, and then I thought I could create a Cron job on my server in Dreamhost. You can think of a Cron job as a structure that runs your scheduled tasks at regular intervals, same as the Task Manager. You can find many services on the internet where you can create a Cron Job.", "Of course, in order to activate the Cron job, I first uploaded my Twitter script to my server via SSH (Secure Shell). Thus, the Cron job started to run this script on the server at the times I specified.", "Now, I am able to get my \u2018Twitter Economy Notes\u2019 twice a day \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "With only 26 lines of the code you have seen above, I am able to create a cost-effective service for my personal use. This is, of course, a very simple application, but the point I want to make here is that how strong brands or channels provide powerful solutions if they are combined effectively. This is a good case study, which shows that the code you write can mean a lot to you as standalone, however, it makes a greater impact if it is supported by business models.", "The following points can be improved:", "Many thanks to all of the following environments that have enabled me to implement this work:", "Your home for data science.
