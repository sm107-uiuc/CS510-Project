Earnings call transcripts from Quarter 1 to 4\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["This article is part of an NLP series where I use text mining techniques to analyze earnings calls.", "In today\u2019s article, I will be analyzing Apple Inc\u2019s earnings call in Financial Year 2020 with keyword extraction and frequency analysis techniques in R.", "Earnings call transcripts from Quarter 1 to 4 of Financial Year 2020 released by Apple Inc were used for analysis. After obtaining the dataset, I used Microsoft Excel and RPA tools to pre-process it.", "Since the dataset is relatively small, consisting of about 30,000 words only, I was careful when pre-processing the dataset. I only converted the text to lowercase and removed the common stop words.", "It happens very often in text mining processes where after removing stop words, the text would lose much of its meaning. Hence, I decided to keep most of the words in the transcripts and to perform a more thorough analysis later on.", "After cleaning the dataset, I started the analysis by looking at the most used words in the meetings.", "Since I only removed common stop words in the pre-processing stage, most words are still preserved in the dataset. I generated the word cloud below with words mentioned at least 50 times in the earnings calls.", "The size of the words indicates their frequencies. The bigger the text, the higher the word frequency.", "Based on the frequency analysis, \u201ciPhone\u201d, \u201cservices\u201d, \u201ccloud\u201d, \u201ciPad\u201d, \u201cmac\u201d, and \u201cpro\u201d are products and services mentioned more than 50 times in the earnings calls.", "For the positivity word cloud, I first used the Bing lexicon to label words into positive and negative categories and then sorted the list to find the most used sentiment words.", "Most of the words in the top 10 positivity word list are positive, including \u201cinnovation\u201d, \u201cpowerful\u201d, and \u201cexcited\u201d, occurring more than 10 times. These keywords may indicate that Apple has been doing well in Financial Year 2020.", "RAKE also known as Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction is a keyword extraction algorithm that is very efficient. The algorithm tries to determine keywords in a body of text by analyzing the frequency of word appearance and its co-occurrence with other words in the text.", "After tagging the words in the transcripts to a corresponding part of a speech tag and using the RAKE method to extract keywords, I also wanted to organize the words into different categories to obtain better insights.", "\u201cApple card\u201d, \u201cApple news\u201d, \u201cApple tv\u201d, \u201chome accessory\u201d are among the top product and service-related keywords extracted using RAKE.", "The bar chart above extracts proper nouns and nouns that appear together in Apple\u2019s transcript documents. A few words that stood out to me are \u201ccost savings\u201d, \u201capp store\u201d, and \u201cservice business\u201d.", "Apple has always been known as a value-driven company, by creating products that \u201cadd value\u201d to its customers\u2019 everyday experiences. Hence the word \u201ccost savings\u201d could be a new cost-structure strategy that the company has put forward to work through the Covid-19 pandemic.", "While the bar charts don\u2019t really tell if Apple is doing good or not so good with its \u201capp store\u201d, it is the only business channel-related keyword derived from RAKE. Since business channels are the touchpoint of a company with its customers, it plays a very important role in the customer experience. While the word \u201ccustomer satisfaction\u201d has been popping up in the frequency analysis and RAKE keyword extraction, I assume that Apple would be pouring its resources to make sure that its app store continues to impress and deliver value to its customers.", "Like the frequency analysis, \u201cservice business\u201d is also one of the keywords extracted using RAKE. While Apple started as a product company, it seems clear that they are moving into the service business, to increase its market share in the service field and to provide an end-to-end value proposition for its customers.", "After extracting a few keywords, I wanted to see how each word is related to one another in the document. In R, there is a network function that allows us to visualize the words in a network graph.", "In this bigram network, words are displayed as nodes and the relationship between them is displayed as lines. The darker the lines between the two words, the higher the frequency the word pair was found in the document.", "After generating the bigram network in R, I circled a few groups of words that I think could tell us something about Apple\u2019s business model or strategy.", "One theme emerged from three groups of words in the bigram network. Starting from the left, the \u201ccloud\u201d word-group; the \u201csubscriptions\u201d word-group at the bottom; and the \u201capple\u201d word-group on the far right tells us that Apple\u2019s future is beyond its smartphones or computers, and increasingly towards providing services value to its customers. Among the many services provided by the company, ranging from Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple care, etc., cloud service might be the company\u2019s core service.", "The \u201ciPhone\u2019 word-group also has the word \u201crevenue\u201d within, which may suggest that iPhone is one of its most profitable products. The \u201csupply chain\u201d word-group is linked with the word \u201cconstraint\u201d and \u201cconstraints\u201d, which may be the reason why the company is seeking to alter its operation by cutting costs. It is unlikely that \u201ccost-savings\u201d has restrained the supply chain as company representatives are unlikely to share bad decision moves in earnings calls.", "In this section, I used the udpipe package in R to tag the words in the transcripts into verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives, and so on. The most occurring nouns were similar to the result from the frequency analysis, hence I did not include them in this article. But, the most occurring proper noun bar chart provided more insights, as shown below:", "In the earnings calls, a number of countries were mentioned. The most mentioned country is \u201cChina\u201d. Then I used the findAssoc function to find out how these two words correlate with any other words in the extracted transcripts.", "Scores range from 0 to 1. A score of 1 means that two words always appear together, while a score approaching 0 means the terms rarely appear in the same document. Minimum correlation values are often relatively low because of word diversity.", "China experienced a country-wide lockdown early this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Clearly, the lockdown made an impact on Apply\u2019s global supply chain where most of their suppliers and sources were located in China.", "The word \u201cphenomenal\u201d also made the list of words correlated with \u201cChina\u201d. This may indicate that Apple is doing well in terms of revenue and sales in the country.", "In this article, I looked at the earnings calls of Apple Inc. in its Financial Year 2020 and attempted to extract keywords and visualize the word relationships in the transcripts. A few key takeaways from the dataset:", "Your home for data science.
