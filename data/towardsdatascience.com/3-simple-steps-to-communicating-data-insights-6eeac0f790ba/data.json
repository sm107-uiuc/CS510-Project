Dashboards are great because they can visually show a lot of information in a concise way. I love building dashboards because it allows me to tap into my creativity and display different types of data in ways that can be consumed intuitively.", "To me, these dashboards are chock-full of insights just waiting to be acted on. I get all excited, pour my heart and soul into those suckers, and gleefully send them out to stakeholders. And then, nothing happens. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.", "After a particular period of mourning, I started digging into where things were going wrong. I didn\u2019t understand how I was putting all this great data into the hands of the people who needed it but they weren\u2019t using it. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!", "The problem was, people were overwhelmed by the dashboards and didn\u2019t know where to start. I see the data but so what? I spend so much of my time entrenched in data that sometimes I forget that most people don\u2019t. While interpreting data has become intuitive to me, people who don\u2019t spend all day, every day up to their ears in numbers need to spend a lot more conscious effort interpreting.", "I have found that a very simple formula for communicating data has been really helpful. I started using the formula myself and then started teaching it to others so they could pull their own insights from their data.", "Once you have completed these steps, you can then communicate insights from the data. How are we performing against our benchmark and what should we do about it?", "Let\u2019s start with choosing a benchmark. Before we know how we are performing, we first need to know what \u201cgood\u201d is. We need to put our performance into context.", "Let\u2019s say we are looking at a turnover dashboard and want to report out on the results to leaders. There are several methods for choosing a benchmark to compare to:", "The key when deciding the type of comparison to use is that you want it to be similar enough so that it is meaningful. For example, an internal group comparison might not make sense if you are looking at two office locations that are wildly different from each other (e.g. different number of employees, different roles, etc.). Similarly, a historical comparison might not make sense if there has been a significant amount of change in the last year (e.g. you have doubled in size). While an apples to apples comparison is almost never possible, we want to avoid an apples to giraffes comparison.", "In addition to the considerations above, using a company goal should be used cautiously. Goal theory is a whole fascinating can of worms for another day but keep in mind that these goals often need to be flexible. Does this goal make sense for this department (i.e. is this a specific type of department that we might have different expectations for)? Does this goal make sense considering the current context (e.g. organizational change, employment market, etc.)?", "Once we have selected our benchmark, we can then contextualize our performance. This can be extremely simple. We essentially need to communicate to leaders if they need to stay the course or if they need to make a change.", "Here are some examples for adjectives to use when contextualizing our performance:", "Let\u2019s say that we are going to be sending an email to Jolly, the leader of our customer service call center in Lollypop Woods. We have decided to use an internal group comparison for our benchmark: a similar sized customer service call center in Licorice Lagoon.", "In our example, let\u2019s say that Licorice Lagoon\u2019s year-to-date turnover is 18% and Lollypop Woods\u2019 year-to-date turnover is 24%. To keep it simple, you could simply say that Lollypop Woods\u2019 turnover is higher, or worse, than our comparison group. This at least gives the leader a gauge into how their turnover is performing.", "If we wanted to take it a step further, we could use multiple benchmarks. Woah, watch out. We could say that Lollypop Woods\u2019 turnover is higher than our comparison group and it is also slightly higher than their turnover was last year. This is exciting stuff! Now we get to dig in to the what do we do about it.", "Now that we know how we are performing compared to our benchmark, we need to know what to do about it.", "It is a good practice to have a bank of potential action plans that your organization is willing to commit to for various scenarios (i.e. what actions are we prepared to do if: our turnover is high, our engagement is low, etc.). For example, a potential action plan to lower turnover would be to give everyone a million dollar raise, but is that feasible for your company? (If it is, please call me). That way, when we are ready to pull insights from our data, we can choose the best pre-vetted plan of action based on our performance and benchmark.", "Perhaps we have already learned that the following practices help lower turnover: having career conversations with employees, rotational job programs, increased learning opportunities. Once we have our bank of possible options available, we can then select an appropriate action plan based on performance and context.", "If we go back to our Lollypop Woods example, we know that our turnover is higher than it was last year and it is higher than our comparison group. Our turnover in Lollypop Woods is off-track.", "We take a look at our bank of potential action plans for reducing turnover. When looking at our action plans we know that we do not currently have the budget for increased learning opportunities so we ignore that one for now. When looking at the other options, we might not know if employees would rather have more career conversations or a rotational job program.", "If we need more information, we can look at responses to our exit survey (if we have one) or we can facilitate focus groups with employees to discuss what is currently keeping them in their role and what would make them more committed to the organization.", "After looking at responses to our exit survey we see that most employees who have left the organization say that they left because they did not feel like they had a clear career path within the organization. Because of this, you decide that having career conversations with employees to discuss what their goals are and what their next steps can be at the organization is the best course of action to address the increased turnover in Lollypop Woods.", "Now that we have selected the most appropriate course of action, we are ready to finish our email to our leader, Jolly.", "Our year-to-date turnover is higher in Lollypop Woods than it was last year and higher than it is in comparison groups. In order to get our turnover in Lollypop Woods back on track, I recommend that we have career conversations with all employees. These conversations are to increase retention by ensuring that employees feel like they have a clear career path and a direction to grow at the organization.", "Just remember that when sharing data insights with leaders, it doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. Leaders need to know if they need to keep doing what they are doing or if they need to do something differently. Follow these steps to get started:", "Keep banging your head against the wall, it gets so much better!", "I\u2019m an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist working in People Analytics. I believe that work should be fun, tequila should be considered medicinal, and data should be democratized.", "Your home for data science.
