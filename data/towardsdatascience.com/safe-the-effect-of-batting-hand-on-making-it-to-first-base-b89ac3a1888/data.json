I\u2019m unsure of why this particular question came up, but someone inquired as to the living room\u2019s opinion on whether it\u2019s easier, in general, for left-handed or right-handed batters to make it to first base after connecting with the ball. It\u2019s an interesting question for which no one had a sufficient answer. My father, shining beacon of wisdom that he is, said that I should take the scientific approach to solving this problem, suggesting I get 30 or so of my friends & colleagues together for an afternoon of base-running at the local diamond. It\u2019s not a bad idea, but getting 30 people together in the middle of a global pandemic might be poor call. In lieu of direct scientific observation, pouring through already collected stats would likely serve. This in mind, and in honor of the 2020 World Series just wrapping up (congrats Dodgers\u2019 Fans!), I decided I\u2019d center my inaugural data-project-article-blog around this topic.", "During the living room debate two hypotheses, one for each side, arose. Adherents to the EASY-L hypothesis argue that left handed batters (LHBs) have it easier, as the distance from their side of home plate to first base is smaller than those hitting right. Proponents of the EASY-R say that because right handed batters (RHBs) have to turn less to face first base, they accelerate more efficiently and arrive at 1B with greater ease. Figure 1 gives a graphical representation of the logic behind these hypotheses. Both are sound ideas, but only one can be crowned champion. Let\u2019s see what the data says.", "First off, for this project I used 2020 Hitting Statistics data downloaded from BaseballSavant [1], a statistics website offshoot of the MLB. It has a great UI which means there\u2019s no need to scrape anything\u2026? It\u2019s nice when things are simple. The only issue with the data set I used (and most baseball datasets) is that it does not include batting hand as a feature in each player entry. Considering batting hand is the class distinction this entire analysis is based on, not having that data is a teensy issue. Luckily, after doing some digging, I was able to find another data set on BaseballSavant that DID include batting hand as a feature (so definitely no scraping!) [2].", "After adding a batting hand categorical variable, I split the main data set into three sub sets: (1) Right Hand Batters, (2) Left Hand Batters, and (3) Switch Hitter stats. I separated switch hitters from the two single side hitter sets as there aren\u2019t any easily available stats describing a switch batter\u2019s performance on both sides of home plate. In any case, once this separation was completed, it was time to jump into the data.", "A good initial statistic to check out is player batting average (BA or AVG) of which our data shows that RHBs (in 2020) perform about 2% better than LHBs (Figure 2.). This is an interesting result: common sense says batters perform better when they face a pitcher with a throwing arm opposite of their batting arm. Considering that the majority of current pitchers throw right handed, common wisdom would suggest LHBs should, on average, perform better than RHBs, but I digress.", "The two percent edge of RHBs over their left counterparts\u2019 BA is possibly a point for the EASY-R hypothesis, but it\u2019s definitely a minor one. BA is the ratio of total hits to at-bats; singles, doubles, triples and home runs are considered hits when calculating this metric. This muddies the water of our analysis, which centers around the ease of getting to 1B. A batter being a good base runner is probably a component of achieving a high batting average, but being a good hitter is a much more important attribute in this regard.", "A better modified batting average metric for this particular analysis would omit non-single hits. We could calculate a new batting average, a \u2018single average,\u2019 which would be the ratio of a player\u2019s total recorded singles to the player\u2019s number of non-strikeout outs (fly outs, ground outs, line drive outs, and popup outs). However, this metric would still have issues for describing a batter\u2019s ability to get to first base. A player\u2019s singles average includes ALL recorded singles, which means that line drives and flyballs are counted. Similarly, the total outs number includes flyouts and line drive outs. The issue with including these types of hits/outs is that there is no chance for a batter to be thrown out at first. If a batter can\u2019t conceivably be thrown out, then this metric does not accurately describe how efficiently a batter gets to 1B. A better metric would be the ratio of ground hits to ground events (hits + outs) for a player or H/(H+O)G.", "If you\u2019ve watched a game or two of baseball, you\u2019ve likely seen a close call at 1B after a batter hits a fast ground ball. In these scenarios, players with a base-running disadvantage should be thrown out more often than their advantage counterparts; advantaged runners should score higher H/(H+O)G numbers. As such, I computed the H/(H+O)G for each player and plotted the results in Figure 3. Again, right hand batters appear to have perform slightly better than left handed batters, by a margin of ~5%. Another point for the EASY-R crew.", "So far the data shown suggests that RHBs get on base more often than LHBs on average. However, whether right handed batters have a running advantage or are just better batters is still unclear. I looked at batter running metrics to figure out THE TRUTH.", "The specific metrics I used to for this were runner speed (RS) and the average time it takes a runner to get from home plate to 1B (HP-1B). Due to the relationship between velocity/speed and displacement/distance, you\u2019d expect those metrics to have some sort of linear relationship. That\u2019s exactly what is observed in Figure 4, as data from all three categories shows an inverse relationship between runner speed and time to 1B. This makes sense \u2014 the faster you go, the quicker you get to your destination. While this result was expected, there\u2019s still a lot of info to unpack from this data.", "First, let\u2019s look at the results of running linear regressions on the data of each category. The right hand and switch hitter lines have R\u00b2 = 0.85, showing a relatively strong relationship between time and runner speed. The left hand line has a R\u00b2 = 0.77, a significantly weaker relationship. There\u2019s a good explanation for the left hand line to have a lower R\u00b2 value, but we\u2019ll get back to that shortly. All three lines have relatively similar slopes (L = -0.1345, R = -0.1341, S = -0.140) and have y-intercepts of L=8.04, R=8.14, and S=8.2. To interpret these numbers, we have to understand the meaning of the linear function that describes the data.", "Let\u2019s talk about the y-intercept. We know that our y variable is measured in seconds, which mean our y-intercept is as well. The y-intercept in this context is the difference between the ideal time it would take an object in friction-less vacuum to travel the 90 or so feet from home plate with a given velocity and the actual observed time it takes a runner to get there; we\u2019ll call it \u2018time-cost.\u2019 Lets assume that players are relatively similar, aerodynamically speaking (a shocking proposal). If our assumption is correct, the difference in time-cost between LHBs and RHBs likely stems from the small difference in the actual distance they have to run (Figure 1.) .", "What about slope? Again, we know that our y variable is measured in seconds and we know that our x variable is measured in feet/sec. If we want to convert the latter unit into the former, we\u2019d need to multiply our x variable by a quantity of units sec\u00b2/feet. This slope unit is the inverse of the unit we use to measure acceleration (feet/sec\u00b2), meaning that the calculated slopes represent \u2018inverse acceleration.\u2019 The more negative a slope in this case means that the represented group accelerates more slowly. The interpretation here suggests that LHBs and RHBs, on average, accelerate at the same rate. Switch hitters accelerate at a minutely lower rate than L\u2019s and R\u2019s.", "The data shows that acceleration/slope is relatively the same, and there is a time-cost difference of about 0.1 seconds between lefties and righties. This effectively means that in general an LHB will arrive at 1B a tenth of second before a right handed counterpart with the same speed. However, this only a general case. The data also shows some LHBs can increase their time\u2019s over right handers with the same speed by almost half of a second! That\u2019s a solid margin in a 90 ft sprint. Call it a grand-slam for EASY-L!", "How is that possible? Recall, that the R\u00b2 value of the regressed left hander curve was significantly worse than that of the right hander or switch hitter curves. Visually, this makes sense,as there is a larger spread in y-axis values for a given x-axis value. What is the cause of this spread? Speculation time! I\u2019m interpreting the deviation from the regressed line as a measure of the batter\u2019s turning efficiency. Recall that LHBs must turn through a wide angle to face 1B. My guess is that some batters are able to turn through this larger angle \u2018better\u2019 than others and reap a sweet time bonus as a result. I hypothesized that the ability to turn, and by extension time bonus, may have a relationship with a player\u2019s fitness and plotted time differential vs. BMI for each player to test for this (Figure. 5). Weight and height data used to calculate BMI was taken from the Chadwick Baseball Bureau data bank [3].", "Unfortunately for me, there was no such relationship. In hindsight, this isn\u2019t terribly surprising, as there is apparent academic disagreement around the efficacy of BMI as an indicator of fitness [4]. That being said, interestingly, most of the players in the MLB are overweight (BMI > 25) according to the CDC [4]. There\u2019s lots more analysis to do here, but for both of our sakes lets wrap up. Here\u2019s the tl;dr take home message.", "If you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed my first blog/article.
