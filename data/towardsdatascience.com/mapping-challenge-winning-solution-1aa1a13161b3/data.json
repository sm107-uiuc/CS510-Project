imagery is increasingly popular topic among data scientists. Satellite data exhibits number of possible applications in both business and research domains. Use cases are ranging from classification and localization, to semantic or instance segmentation. Last one \u2014 instance segmentation \u2014 is all about detecting an object class on the image, then segmenting each instance of that object (think: select all cats on the image).", "This post is about the winning solution to the instance segmentation challenge, called the Mapping Challenge \ud83c\udf10, organized under the auspices of crowdAI and Humanity & Inclusion. Here, I will share our process, way of working, solution internals and final results. Few words about the tech stack will be said as well \ud83d\ude09", "Satellite images deliver high quality overview of the Earth surface. Such data can be used for public profit. One example is research project: \u201cCombining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty\u201d. Researchers from Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research (US) use deep learning approaches (specifically transfer learning technique and VGG network architecture) to estimate household consumption and assets in some countries from the developing world.", "Another example is supporting response to humanitarian crisis or natural disasters. How can Mapping Challenge contribute to this goal?", "We are in a period of increasing humanitarian crises, both in scale and number (\u2026). Often, accurate maps either do not exist or are outdated by disaster or conflict.*", "Despite their importance, new maps are drawn by hand, so there is urgent need for automated methods that can help generate accurate real-time maps. Therefore, significance of the competition may be summarized very briefly:", "Many parts of the world have not been mapped; especially (\u2026) those most vulnerable to natural hazards. Obtaining maps of these potential crisis areas greatly improves the response of emergency (\u2026) actors.*", "The practical goal of this challenge that is approachable by data scientist is to:", "(\u2026) explore how Machine Learning can help pave the way for automated analysis of satellite imagery to generate (\u2026) maps.*", "If you want to participate in machine learning challenges organized around open data simply go to crowdAI.org and pick your favorite. Some time ago, in early April 2018, we were attracted by the Mapping Challenge. We are specialized in the image-based machine learning and prior to this one we participated in the Data Science Bowl 2018, where we worked mostly with U-Net and Mask R-CNN architectures. During DSB\u201918 we developed clean implementation of the U-Net that is highly parametrizable. This competition is also about segmentation, however here, we work with satellite imagery, instead of microscope images. We have decided to participate in Mapping Challenge because of several reasons:", "Data Science Quartet participated in the competition, that is: Jakub Czakon, Kamil Kaczmarek, Andrzej Pyskir, Piotr Tarasiewicz (alphabetical order). Since it was team work entire time, thus \u2014 for simplicity \u2014 I will refer further achievements to the team as a whole, not to any particular person. Here, at neptune.ml we strongly believe that this success would not be possible without strong team cooperation. Our team of 4, just like the Gang of Four (GoF \u2014 these four authors are famous for their Design Patterns book), consisted of enthusiasts who are passionate about machine learning. We come from two companies: Jakub and Kamil are from neptune.ml, Andrzej and Piotr are from deepsense.ai \u2014 machine learning and AI consultancy company.", "We had regular weekly planning sessions (to report progress and discuss future directions), daily stand-ups (to let everybody know about latest work), slack-like communication channels for ad hoc conversations and Pull Requests for comments directly in code (and code review of course \ud83d\ude04).", "Prior to entering the challenge we had some principles, that we are eager to realize in any project that we pursue.", "clean code \u2014 we think that single competition is just one step towards something bigger. Hence, we are not tempted to sacrifice engineering quality for immediate gains on the competition leader-board. Well designed implementations with nice interfaces will pay off later in future competitions and commercial data science projects.", "\ufe0fteam work \u2014 data science projects are \u2014 by definition \u2014 team work. Smooth progress with constant iteration of new ideas (some of them worked well, some not so much) was one of the crucial factors that gave us 1st place in this competition. Anybody can propose the idea, pick task that she likes most, and think about their contributions to the project. This open environment was critical for our success.", "fast experimentation \u2014 thanks to the clean solution development process we were able to iterate over ideas smoothly. Beginning with day 1, all experiments were run on neptune.ml, our platform for data science projects. Single place for all your artifacts related to the experiment: results, outputs, saved models, code, charts, hyperparameters \u2014 was very convenient and created common place to compare results and look at each others work. It became handy, because number of experiments quickly crossed 1 hundred (to date we ran more that 1000 experiments, all publicly available \ud83d\ude0e).", "public sharing \u2014 neptune.ml team has the vision to open and show the entire process related to data science projects. That is why code base was open source from day 1. Everybody could observe how it grows, when new models are developed and how we build routines to efficiently handle competition data. It was quite a challenge because of number of images: 280741 in train, 60317 in validation and 60697 in test sets. Moreover, everybody could observe our experiment running live on neptune, browse charts, results. Finally, we let everybody reproduce our results, because we shared complete set of information and guidance how to do it. We named our idea Open Solution.", "Here, we share what worked well from team perspective and what we continue to do in current challenges (for insight regarding deep learning check \u201cWinning solution description\u201d section):", "At the level of hardware, we develop code on regular laptops and train models either in the cloud (neptune.ml handle communication with Google Cloud Platform. User can select her favorite GCP machine with either Nvidia K80 or P100 GPU) or locally on Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPUs. In the later case, we use neptune.ml to monitor experiments that we compute locally (see section \u201cNeptune.ml\u201d below for more details).", "We work with Python 3.5 and this is our most basic block of the tech stack. We can distinguish between few logical layers, that will be described in the following section.", "At the top, we have number of Python Packages that we use daily to simplify common tasks in data science. Below, most important are presented, together with few words of justification why them matters \ud83d\ude09.", "(all requirements are on our repository in the file requirements.txt)", "Our team participated in competitions and commercial projects before winning Mapping Challenge. Back then it became clear that there is a need for some simple and clean interface for building complex machine learning pipelines. Steppy is lightweight, Python library that enables clean machine learning pipeline design. It is complementary to the neptune platform, but is 100% independent technically. Steppy-toolkit in turn is curated set of transformers that makes your work with steppy faster and more effective.", "It is community-friendly platform supporting data scientists in creating and sharing machine learning models. Neptune facilitates teamwork, infrastructure management, models comparison and reproducibility. We ran all our experiments on neptune.ml to ensure that we can reproduce them and compare later in time.
