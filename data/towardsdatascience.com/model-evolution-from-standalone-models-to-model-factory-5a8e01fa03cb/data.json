Both these articles were focused on highlighting the issues, but did not provide any solutions. In the next couple of articles we will focus on providing some concrete practices for addressing these gaps.", "The potential contribution of AI to the global economy and the importance of investing in AI is well recognized within the business and technical communities. In a recent CEO survey, more than 85% of the CEO\u2019s believed that AI will significantly change the way they do business. Although only 6% of those surveyed admitted to having enterprise-wide AI initiatives, nearly 20% of them plan to deploy AI enterprise-wide in the near-term. One of the biggest challenges in enterprise-wide deployment of models is the time it takes to deploy models. In a recent survey, nearly 58% of companies surveyed reported that it took 31 days or more to deploy models.", "As we have tracked and helped enterprises evolve from building simple analytical models to more sophisticated, continuously learning models embedded within larger transactional applications we have seen three distinct phases.", "Standalone Model Phase: In this phase, companies have typically deployed models on a standalone basis using command line interfaces and Jupyter notebooks. The models were also typically simpler, not interacting real-time with data sources or software applications. Companies were using these models within a single group in a larger functional or business unit. Also, the data scientists were typically the ones to scope, design, build, deploy and maintain the models. This phase was essential for companies to prove the value of AI/ML models and to learn the challenges of more widespread usage.", "Prediction as a Service Phase: Once companies were able to demonstrate the value of these models there was a demand to make the predictions from these models available to other groups within the enterprise. In addition, as multiple groups within large companies started building their own models there was a significant level of duplication of effort, skills, and also heterogeneity of architectures, design patterns, and tools. This led to more of an engineering approach to model delivery, deployment and monitoring. Advances in software engineering, including micro-services architecture, Dockers, and Kubernetes were used to provide model predictions as a service to other software systems. For example, a NER (Named-Entity-Recognition) model could be developed once and provided as a REST API service to other web applications.", "Model Factory Phase: More advanced companies are moving to a factory model where hundreds (if not thousands) of models are deployed. Automated CD/CI (Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration) pipelines are being combined with CL (Continuous Learning) pipelines. This allows companies to automate the data ingestion as well as periodic or continuous retraining of models. This allows companies to have flexible deployment strategies that allow for automated or semi-automated model retraining. This addresses some of the significant challenges of deployment time and cost that we discussed earlier. Automated deployment also opens up the opportunity to automate the continuous monitoring of models \u2014 essential in addressing the return realization trap that we discussed in Part 2 of this series. Finally, integrated and end-to-end model lineage tracking, experiment and inference logging enable factory-like operations of models.", "As an organization progresses along these three phases, the number of models they deploy and the sophistication of these models increase \u2014 essentially the scale and scope of model building, deployment, and monitoring increase. Second, the data ingestion moves from batch-mode to streaming and real-time. This facilitates the increase in volume, variety, and velocity of data. Data versioning gets integrated with model versioning to enable rapid experimentation and retraining of models. Third, the software applications encapsulate traditional software (Software 1.0 code) as well as machine learning models (Software 2.0) enabling truly \u2018smart software\u2019 for business problems.", "The increasing scale and sophistication across the combination of software, models, and data has seen the emergence of new roles. Software development has had roles such as business analyst, systems analyst, architect, developer, tester, development-operations (DevOps), etc. When you examine more closely, these roles reflect the scoping, design, development, operations, and maintenance phases of the software life-cyle. With the emergence of Machine Learning models and the paradigm of Software 2.0 we see a number of new skills and roles.", "The role of the data scientist emerged during the standalone phase of model evolution when a combination of three skills \u2014 subject matter or domain expertise, mathematics and statistics, and computer science and big data \u2014 were required. In a 2012 article Hal Varian, the Chief Economist at Google called the Data Scientist as the sexiest job in the 21st century.", "The sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians. People think I\u2019m joking, but who would\u2019ve guessed that computer engineers would\u2019ve been the sexy job of the 1990s?", "As we started moving from the first foundational phase of models to the second phase of prediction as a service, there was a need for someone to scale and optimize the proof-of-concept models developed by data scientists. This led to the emergence of Machine Learning or ML Engineers. Jeff Hale describes the role of ML engineers as follows:", "Machine learning engineers take the models data scientists have created that show predictive promise and turn them into code that performs well in production.", "With more ML models being developed, scaled, and deployed the task of maintaining these models in a manual fashion was becoming infeasible. As organizations started moving towards the third phase of a Model Factory we saw the emergence of yet another role \u2014 Machine Learning or (ML) Operations (or MLOps for short). MLOps specialists seek to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently.", "In the Model Factory phase we are seeing the integration of data, software, and models. Machine learning pipelines integrate data and code. Cristian Breuel in his paper on MLOps: Machine Learning as an Engineering Discipline elaborates this point further.", "The root cause is that there\u2019s a fundamental difference between ML and traditional software: ML is not just code, it\u2019s code plus data. An ML model, the artifact that you end up putting in production, is created by applying an algorithm to a mass of training data, which will affect the behavior of the model in production. Crucially, the model\u2019s behavior also depends on the input data that it will receive at prediction time, which you can\u2019t know in advance.", "In summary, there are four key dimensions \u2014 software engineering, software operations, statistics and machine learning, and data management coming together. Data Engineers are at the intersection of software engineering and data management; ML Engineers are at the intersection of software engineering and statistics and machine learning. Data Scientists are at the intersection of statistics and machine learning, data management, and domain expertise (not shown in the diagram below). Finally, MLOps are at the intersection of software operations, statistics and ML, and data management.", "Each of these four roles have very specific skillsets. The detailed role description and the skill sets for these are given below.", "In this blog we traced the evolution of how software, models, and data are coming together to create a powerful approach to solving business problems. Being conscious of the differences between software and models (Part 1) allows us to recognize the unique skills required to address some of the traps (Part 2) in building intelligent software. While necessary, they are not sufficient to address all the challenges that we have outlined so far in bringing software, models, and data together. In the next few blogs we will address issues related to the development methodology and model lifecycle.", "Authors: Anand S. Rao, Joseph Voyles and Shinan Zhang", "Your home for data science.
