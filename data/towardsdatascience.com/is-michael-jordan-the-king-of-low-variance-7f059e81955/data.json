But with it also the neverending debate over who is the \u201cGOAT\u201d or greatest of all times, where Jordan doesn\u2019t have a clear advantage in the statistics \u2014 he didn\u2019t win as many championships as Bill Russell, didn\u2019t score as many points as Kareem, Karl Malone, Wilt Chamberlain and even the still active Lebron James. He dominates points per game but only by a very small margin over Wilt Chamberlain. So what is it that makes him so special? Or is considering him the GOAT just a marketing stunt by NBA promoters and Nike, that got infused in our naive 90s kid's memories? Well, I\u2019d like to consider one last defense that is mentioned repeatedly in the documentary -", "He came to win every game, and came to give a big show every game, for that little kid in the audience that never watched him live before.", "Maybe we can see this in the data? If Michael Jordan was a consistent performer, we would expect to see that he didn\u2019t have many \u2018bad nights\u2019. This means his points per game shouldn\u2019t usually be much lower than his average. The measurement of variance should be able to capture that.", "We want to compare Jordan to other great scorers \u2014 we will take Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Lebron James as comparisons. We also want to only take seasons where they scored with good averages, otherwise, the variance comparison is not interesting. Think of it like that \u2014 if someone scores an average of five points per game, and never scores more than ten points, this player will have low variance, but he\u2019s no good. We\u2019re looking for the 30 points per game player with variance 5. Also, many players take time to warm up in their rookie years, and have some decline in their final years in the leagues, so we want to leave these out of the analysis. For that purpose, we will only take seasons where the players scored more than 25 on average, and played at least 50 games. We will also show a normalized version of the variance by the average of that season, so that players like Wilt Chamberlain are compensated for seasons with >50 average points per game (how crazy is that..?), that as we mentioned might have inherently higher variance. We will combine regular season with playoffs for the variance estimation. Our data source will be the very detailed https://www.basketball-reference.com", "Lebron and Jordan have almost identical variance. Can we craft some finer estimator for consistency?", "Our last shot at it will be the following -", "We don\u2019t want to measure variance in the higher scores \u2014 a high variance score punishes a player for having amazing shows of 50\u201360 points, because it\u2019s very different than his average. We want to only punish for \u2018bad nights\u2019, and we want all the players to be measured by some global scale, similar to what we did with the normalized variance, because again if you\u2019re a 5 points player game just measuring distance from your own average wouldn\u2019t count as if you have many bad nights (as your average isn\u2019t so good to begin with). So we take the formula", "where P is the set of all game point scores.", "The entire data histograms for your visual judgement:", "So there you have it. The win definitely doesn\u2019t go to Jordan, but he\u2019s very strong in the consistency category. With the exception of Wilt Chamberlain, I think it will be hard to find players that have similar performances, though that requires much deeper research to verify. Also, of course, scoring isn\u2019t everything \u2014 for example, Bill Russel is not a good scorer at all, and Magic Johnson also not so much, and besides other statistics like assists, rebounds, blocks and steals they\u2019re also measured in style, winner attitude and clutch. It\u2019s weird though that you never see second moment statistics used in game analysis, when they are so common in regular statistical work. Basically everything is about averages, and in the best case about conditional expectations (\u201c65% of teams leading 3\u20131 in the playoffs have \u2026\u201d)", "Your home for data science.
