Do not be fooled however, in spite of its simplicity, the kNN algorithm could still be extremely effective in some instances.", "Firstly, kNN is a non-parametric algorithm \u2014 this means that it doesn\u2019t assume that your data follows any particular distribution. Another cool thing is that it can perform classification and regression tasks, both of which we\u2019ll be touching on in this post.", "First we are going to be using a simple representation of a data set to illustrate how we would use kNN to perform a Classification task.", "Let Magenta be type A and Black be type B. These points would make up the given data. Let Blue be the data point that we wish to classify based on our given data.", "To do this, we are going to choose a value k which would be the number of points that are \u201cmost similar\u201d to our new data point.", "In this 2 dimensional example, we would choose our similarity measure to be the euclidean distance.", "So if we let k=2 for example, then we would be looking for the 2 points that are most similar to our new data point. If we then put that in terms of distance then, we would be looking for the 2 closest points.", "After this we calculate the proportion of data points per type in the set of our k nearest points. We then choose the type with the highest proportion and assign our new data point to this type.", "In our case we have that the 2 nearest points were both black.", "So we would classify our new data point as being of Type B.", "On the other hand if we had chosen k to be 8 for instance we would have:", "In that case we would have assigned our new data point to Type A.", "In this case we are largely following through on the same idea.", "For instance, if we were to predict the price of a house using kNN we may have a set up such as the following:", "We want to find the k most similar points, and use the average of the response values for these points as the predicted value for the new data point in question.", "If we let k be 6 and we wanted to predict the price of a 2-bathroom house using this data set, then the most similar data points would first be the other 2-bathroom houses and then the 1 and 3-bathroom houses.", "Indeed, the corresponding predicted price value is the average of the prices of the magenta dots. The resulting prediction is the blue dot.", "As we have seen, the choice of K really does matter.", "Note how the value of K changes the performance of the model without any changes in data. Any such variable is called a hyperparameter.", "Indeed hyperparameter optimization is worthy of a whole post in itself.", "For the purpose of this post however, we\u2019ll only be mentioning the grid search algorithm.", "Here\u2019s a generic picture of what that process may look like over an increasing choice of k.", "Firstly, kNN suffers from the curse of dimensionality, so as the number of input variables grow kNN may start to struggle increasingly. It is worth considering dimensionality reduction techniques to combat this problem.", "Additionally, kNN needs data that is properly scaled. In other words, you may have to normalize your data as a difference in units between measurements can seriously damage the effectiveness of your model.", "One other thing to think about is the fact that parametric methods like linear regression will tend to outperform non-parametric methods like kNN as long as the true relationship in the data actually follows the assumptions of that parametric model. Funny enough, parametric methods may even perform better than non parametric methods on some data that don\u2019t follow all the assumptions \u2014 so don\u2019t rule them out!", "All in all, kNN is relatively simple to understand and implement therefore making it a great method to use as a benchmark for other techniques.", "I hope you enjoyed the read and found it useful in some way, whether it was in learning something new or just refreshing what was already in there.", "I myself am a final year Mathematical Finance Undergrad so I\u2019m every bit of a learner as I am a teacher.", "That being said I\u2019m most definitely open to any suggestions, corrections or any general feedback that comes to mind as you peruse through the post.", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn \u2014", "Or you can also follow me on Twitter if you prefer \u2014", "Your home for data science.
