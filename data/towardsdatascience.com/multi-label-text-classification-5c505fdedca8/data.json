If there are multiple possible answers and only one to be chosen, then it\u2019s multiclass classification. In our example we can\u2019t really select only one label, I would say that all of them match the photo. The goal of multi-label classification is to assign a set of relevant labels for a single instance. However, most of widely known algorithms are designed for a single label classification problems. In this article four approaches for multi-label classification available in scikit-multilearn library are described and sample analysis is introduced.", "In the next sections I will describe methods presented in below diagram.", "In the case of Binary Relevance, an ensemble of single-label binary classifiers is trained independently on the original dataset to predict a membership to each class, as shown on the fig. 2.", "This approach maps each combination of labels into a single label and trains a single label classifier (fig. 3).", "For each instance in the test set, its K nearest neighbours in the train set are identified. For each class y in Y the numbers of neighbouring instances belonging to y are used to compute the posterior probabilities that the test instance belongs or does not belong to y. Based on which of these probabilities are greater , we decide to assign or not the class y to a test instance.", "For better understanding, assume that samples below are neighbours found out in the training set for test instance X = 1.", "Now we have to calculate prior and posteriori probabilities for each class for test instance X = 1", "Maximal values were obtained for f1 and f2. Hence, we assign test instance to those two classes.", "Classifier chain model learns classifiers as in binary relevance method. However, all classifiers are linked in a chain.", "The order in which labels are predicted has large impact on the results.", "We will use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus open dataset for our project. You can download the dataset directly from this link.", "This dataset contains multiple files, but we\u2019ll need only two of them:", "We will create a table containing multiple genres assigned to movies with description. Based on that description we will try to assign proper genres to each movie.", "Let\u2019s start with importing necessary libraries. For described above methods we will use skmultilearn module.", "Now it\u2019s time for cleaning the text from special signs, removing stopwords, stamming and putting genre variable into separate binary columns.", "As the data is ready, we can split it into training and test sets and convert to a matrix of TF-IDF features. We will take top 10000 of them ordered by term frequency across the corpus (due to computational complexity). Please note that N-grams of maximal length 3 are considered here as potential features. As n_gram_range and max_features are essential parameters in terms of accuracy, I recommend you to play with them by your own :).", "Let\u2019s apply models described above and compare the results. For selecting the best model we will measure:", "As you see, accuracy is extremely low in all the cases since the dataset is strongly unbalanced. The best results were obtained for Label Powerset model. However, we have still Classifier Chain to be applied. I will predict here each class probability assignment and then play with threshold parameter a bit (by default it equals 0.5). It says how to distinguish between 0/1 label assignment. You will see that its value is crucial for the model selection.", "The plot shows that the most optimal threshold is around 0.2. This is the point where F1 score is near the maximum point 0.43, accuracy increases and Hamming loss is low.", "To sum up, popular methods for multilabel classification were described and compared on real-life example. The best results were obtained for Classifier Chain method, by modyfing minimal threshold, based on which we assign 1 in binary classification problems. In future work, the order of labels could be shuffled and tested, which is time consuming process.", "In the next article I will use deep learning methods for the same problems. This is the fastest-growing and the most significantt subfield of Natural Language Processing as allows to obtain the best results.", "Your home for data science.
