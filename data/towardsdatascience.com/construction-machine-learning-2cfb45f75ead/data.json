They\u2019re constantly putting out fire after fire on-site to ensure that construction proceeds as smoothly as possible. But what if, through machine learning, we could change this reactive workflow, to be proactive? Machine learning can digest the massive amounts of project data that contractors have to deal with, and can bring to the surface the most critical issues that contractors need to focus on each and every day to avoid setbacks.", "To understand how data analytics and prediction can help the construction industry, it\u2019s important to stand in the shoes of a contractor. A fictional situation from the contractor\u2019s perspective can help us.", "Imagine this: you are the general contractor superintendent on a large construction site. You oversee all operations on-site, from beginning to end. You are in charge of scheduling work day-by-day, supervising all activities and tasks going on, and ensuring the safety of everyone on-site. Your role is essential to the success of the project and the safety of others.", "The construction company you work for is responsible for building the next major headquarters for a big-name tech company (let\u2019s say it\u2019s Amazon HQ3). The architect completed all of the drawings, expedited the building permitting process, and sent the approved plans to you to begin construction. The construction timeline is super tight \u2014 and you begin right away with haste to ensure that your construction team delivers the building to the client on time. There are hundreds of millions of dollars on the line and you\u2019re starting to feel the squeeze. You know that Amazon wants a flawless building and they want it ASAP.", "A few months into construction, the gears are in full motion. The concrete foundation has been poured and the building is starting to go up. You\u2019ve got multiple subcontractors (subs) on-site each doing their part. As the general contractor, you are coordinating the timing of when the subs do the work, assessing the quality of their work, and ensuring that they are complying with site safety measures. On top of all that, the subs are incessantly peppering you with questions:", "Waterproofing Sub: Is the waterproofing for the foundation wall supposed to be cementitious or a liquid-applied membrane?", "Steel Sub: Some of the steel columns just arrived on-site and they look a bit rusted. Were they supposed to be factory-primed?", "Concrete Sub: Has the structural engineer responded to us yet about how much fly-ash in the concrete mix is allowed in the concrete deck for each floor?", "There is not enough time in the day for you to keep tabs on everyone and address questions in a timely manner. As a result, a few questions asked by the subs slip through the cracks, you don\u2019t check-in with every subcontractor regularly, and the work proceeds.", "A month later, you notice that the concrete sub has only completed 2 floors when they should have completed 4 floors by now. Concrete is part of the critical path of construction \u2014 other subs can\u2019t start their work until the concrete is done.", "The concrete sub says that they didn\u2019t how much fly ash was allowed in the concrete. They asked you weeks ago, but because you had so many other fires to put out, you never got around to answering them. So rather than waiting forever for you to answer, they used more than usual to save money on the mix. This concrete takes longer to cure than concrete with less fly ash \u2014 hence the delay. Now you either have to make up a month somehow, or ask the client for more time, lose credibility, and take a huge loss.", "Okay, now that we understand some of the potential pressures and frustrations of contractors, we can sympathize with their situation. It\u2019s easy to miss a little detail with big consequences if left unchecked. It makes it even harder to stay on top of the details if documents and data are not organized. This quote from a BIM 360 blog captures this perfectly:", "\u201cConstruction gets a lot of flak over not documenting things, but I think that\u2019s false. We\u2019re incredible at documenting. We\u2019re just terrible at putting it where it can be found and shared.\u201d -Jeff Sample, Contechcrew", "The quote reveals that contractors sometimes struggle to keep their information organized so that it can be useful \u2014 which isn\u2019t a surprise since there are so many factors that can make the construction process messy. Drawings, products, systems, specifications, and subcontractors can all be revised and change throughout construction. Action items may live on sticky notes that are stuck to the wall, markups to pick up may live on printed sheets scattered on desks, and digital files might be saved all over the place in internal folder structures (or on your desktop).", "Autodesk knows this \u2014 and they\u2019ve created a single digital environment for documentation and data to live alongside other Building Information Modeling (BIM) software that contractors use. This environment is Autodesk BIM 360.", "To avoid complications of multiple processes and different software to deal with managing documents, Autodesk BIM 360 allows contractors to manage documentation and data all in one place.", "RFIs and submittals can be sent, received, tracked, and organized here. Drawings and specs can be managed, updated, and shared here. 3-D models from different trades can be coordinated and analyzed here. Safety rules and observations can be documented here. Checklists, issue lists, and punch lists can be managed here to ensure the quality of the project. Design reviews with comments and markups are also done here as well.", "Besides the obvious benefit of helping to keep the contractor\u2019s information organized, BIM 360 allows contractors to benefit from data analytics through customizable reports and dashboards. BIM 360 also offers prediction capabilities from machine learning models through Construction IQ.", "Now we\u2019re getting to the exciting, high-tech capabilities of Autodesk BIM 360. Since BIM 360 is a single location to store information, Construction IQ pulls from this data to leverage machine learning to identify risk during construction. But why is predicting \u201crisk\u201d important?", "Let\u2019s go back to our fictitious story about our superintendent managing construction on Amazon\u2019s HQ3 project. The superintendent caught that too much fly ash was being used in the concrete mix too late, which led to a costly delay. But what if we could predict a potential risk like this?", "If there is a subcontractor that is making mistakes on a regular basis and these mistakes are recorded in BIM 360, Construction IQ analyzes this data and generates predictions for each sub. It provides a sort of \u201csubcontractor forecast\u201d that tells us if a sub is at a low or high-risk today. This can help us prevent \u201cdanger-prone\u201d subs from making mistakes. Using risk prediction, the general contractor can focus more on the subs that need more supervision.", "Construction IQ brings other risks to our attention as well, such as safety risks and design risks. With the help of dashboards, this is all presented to busy contractors in a clean, quick, intuitive, easy-to-read snapshot. We can drag and drop \u201ccards\u201d for the information that we want to see.", "Construction IQ draws the data that it uses for risk prediction from logged project issues, site observations, checklists, subcontractor tasks, historical data, and other metadata to predict risk on a daily basis.", "It would be interesting to understand the unique mix of algorithms that allows Autodesk to predict if a subcontractor is high-risk or not. A lot of the data collected from contractors is probably text \u2014 observations, issues, checklists, tasks, it\u2019s all text. This is in addition to PDFs of drawings and markups, along with site images that are logged in BIM 360 that the machine learning algorithms may be using to predict risk.", "To determine subcontractor quality and safety risk, under the hood, perhaps Natural Language Processing is being run on each text observation on subcontractor work to extract sentiment, and then put into \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d categories via classification models such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machine (SVM). If there are more \u201cbad\u201d observations, then the risk may be higher for that sub. The ultimate classification of \u201chigh-risk\u201d and \u201clow-risk\u201d observations may be also augmented by a CNN that is looking at quality inspection photos that are taken on-site. Time-series modeling like LSTMs may weight more recent subcontractor observations with greater importance to more accurately forecast a subcontractor\u2019s risk.", "To determine design risk, computer vision may be used to detect design risk from drawings and markup PDFs \u2014 searching for code compliance issues and any errors in the drawings.", "Machine learning is only made possible with the presence of data. No data means no machine learning. So, the advent of machine learning in construction is only made possible by funneling all construction information digitally to our computers and having that information centralized on a single platform (like BIM 360). By keeping information organized, clean, and all in one place, documents are easy to find.", "So what\u2019s next? What else can machine learning help us with on the job site? Besides risk, this BIM 360 blog suggests that image tagging of construction workers that are not abiding by safety standards via computer vision can help ensure the safety of people on-site. Companies like SmartVid.io are at the forefront of this effort.", "Computer vision may also be able to help detect deficient construction \u2014 like cracked concrete, tile, drywall, and other materials. Check out this web-app demo that I created that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for deficiency detection in construction materials and my GitHub repository for the details in developing this tool.", "Furthermore, there may be potential for machine learning to provide further design assistance for architects and engineers working with contractors, such as using AI plugins to determine code compliance as we design in Autodesk Revit models. Check out my blog on UpCodes related to this.", "Machine learning has the potential to change the way that problems are addressed on the construction site, as long as contractors keep their data digitized, organized, and all in one place. Instead of reacting to problems that suddenly appear, contractors will be able to stay on top of potential risks, before they become major problems, thanks to tools like Construction IQ in Autodesk\u2019s BIM 360 environment.", "Machine learning has many more applications in architecture, engineering, and construction that have yet to be developed. And we have to deeply understand the efforts and struggles of the industry in order to bring the most meaningful applications of machine learning to their work.", "Your home for data science.
