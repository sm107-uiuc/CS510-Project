Each larger company is either applying Machine Learning or thinking about doing so soon to solve their problems and understand their data sets. That means it\u2019s time to learn about Machine Learning, especially if you\u2019re looking for new Computer Science challenges. A great way to do that is to read a couple of books. In this text, I\u2019ll review the best machine learning books in 2020.", "If you\u2019re just getting started with Machine Learning definitely read this book:", "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python is a gentle introduction into machine learning. It doesn\u2019t assume any knowledge about Python and it introduces fundamental concepts and applications of machine learning, discussing various methods through examples. That\u2019s the best book I\u2019ve ever seen for an entry level Machine Learning Engineer.", "If you\u2019ve completed a bunch of machine learning projects for yourself and get accustomed to working with machine learning models, here are the books which will take you further:", "Python Machine Learning is just a great practical book with a lot of actual examples of code. It starts gently and then proceeds to most recent advance in machine learning and deep learning. It\u2019s very easy to read and will appeal to people at any level as the second edition even goes to cover GANs.", "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (2nd edition is out!) is an amazing reference at mid-level. It covers all fundamentals (classification methods, dimensionality reduction) and then gets into neural networks and deep learning.", "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning goes through all basic algorithms starting with a good statistics revision. It\u2019s mostly concerned on theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and is great as a companion to other, more practical books.", "At expert level reading scientific papers often is much better than reading books, because knowledge is being updated as we speak. Machine Learning is really living its moment. However it is also great to have a bunch of book references in hand to go into deep learning fully:", "Deep Learning with Python was written by a creator of Keras, one of the most popular machine learning libraries in Python. The book starts gently, is very practical, gives pieces of code you can use right away and has in general many useful tips on using deep learning. An absolute must read in deep learning.", "Deep Learning is an amazing reference for deep learning algorithms. It doesn\u2019t contain much code, but has great insights about how one should approach problems with machine learning: written by pioneers of deep learning. It covers virtually all currently used techniques.", "If you\u2019re more mathematically-oriented, then you\u2019ll love Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective. It\u2019s a tour-de-force through mathematics behind all machine learning methods. You probably won\u2019t be able to read it at once, but it\u2019s very useful as a reference in machine learning research.", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "That\u2019s all! I wish you all the best on your machine learning journey!", "If you are looking for your first entry-level data science job and you don\u2019t know where to start, sign up for my Data Science Job course here. I explain what you should do and learn to become a junior data scientist or a junior machine learning engineer within weeks.", "If you\u2019re looking for other lists of books to read, see:", "Your home for data science.
