After all, we have all come across \u201cit works well on my machine\u201d situations and we all have a general idea of why it\u2019s often the case.", "Many bloggers and commentators have provided thorough explanations of what leads a data science project to premature death, but here are my three favourites:", "One answer to this question is straightforward: you need to make sure you have the right people at the table [1]. Yes, we know data scientists are meant to be the legendary unicorns everybody talks about, but real life especially in big corporates and heavily regulated markets is a different story. Who should sit at the Data Science table is clearly arguable, and everybody might have their own version, but I believe it\u2019s at least necessary to have the key business stakeholders lined up on the project goals and budget, to have a strong blessing from Compliance and IT Security officers, to have somebody who is capable of creating a production pipeline from an engineering stand point and project managers or business analysts to function as a bridge between tech and business/operations.", "Ill defined problem statements are another key issue. Getting the problem definition straight is harder than what people tend to think, as Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg wonderfully argues in this article [3]. Practitioners tend to rely too much on conceptual maps like the one in Fig 2, before spending a sufficient amount of time defining the problem.", "I\u2019ve seen too many times project definition starting with a generically defined problem to solve, followed by a leap forward to which algorithm should be used. When this happens it\u2019s highly likely that the downstream product will fail to see the light. Whether a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm is to be used should not be the first questions to ask, it\u2019s more useful to reflect on what use case type the problem we are trying to solve falls into.", "Typical use case types with Machine Learning are listed in Fig 4. and each of them carries significant differences in the way features are built and in the kind of algorithm that is more appropriate.", "As a mean of example let\u2019s say that we are tasked with solving the problem of finding the right customer target for an e-mail campaign. The goal is to find the customers that are more likely to make an action following a nudge. This seems clear enough. The temptation could be to jump straight into reasoning on whether to use this or that gradient boosting classifier, however more work is needed on defining the problem. Do we want to find the right customers building a predictive algorithm for the target action? Or is it more appropriate to apply Causal Inference techniques to predict which customer will make the action given the nudge [4]? In some cases, where we run many campaigns that change all the time and building a model for each of them is intractable, is it more appropriate to build a Similarity model ?", "As we can see, not giving enough time to analyse the use case type and to define (and re-define) the problem has the potential to lead to a broken product.", "Having the right people at the table and being spot on in defining the problem will not be enough without the right technology stack. To be productive a Data Science team needs the freedom to experiment. This doesn\u2019t mean that companies should let data scientists do tables full scan on production databases, but the team should be equipped with a laboratory environment where data exploration and models creation can happen quickly.", "Referring to Fig 5. the Fast Prototype to Production Engine has three key components:", "Building models that work in the real world is hard, making sure they become real products that make an impact is even harder. However this is the real challenge for the Data Science world in the coming years. Setting up the right team, with the right technology stack and the right commitment from management are necessary pre-conditions to succeed.", "[1] I took the idea of the Data Science table from #AI Expert Alessandro Giaume and Stefano Gatti, Franco Angeli, 2019, pp.79\u201395.", "[4] Nicholas J Radcliffe and Patrick D Surry.
