It usually involves advanced modelling techniques and teams with scarce skills. However, this is only the first step on an even more complex task: deploying the model into production and preventing its degradation.", "Even being alleviated by the cloud shift, at least two-thirds of IT spent is still concentrated on maintenance-mode tasks. There is still little research about where this split holds for ML related projects or not, but my take is that this percentage will even increase significantly due to the fact that an ML workload has more \u201cliquid\u201d inputs and fewer control levers as shown below:", "In essence, maintenance is mainly driven by the level of variability and control we may have over the different components on the system. As shown on the diagram, it is reasonable to conclude that machine learning workloads are more prone to maintenance tasks. To make things even worse, the evolution paths of data and code (business roles) do not necessarily need to be aligned. This is greatly explained in depth in Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems", "It is reasonable to conclude that machine learning workloads are more prone to maintenance tasks", "It is absolutely necessary then, to develop a robust framework for ensuring control over the Machine Learning operations once our model is deployed into production, and at the same time ensure the quality of the models and its evolution is not compromised.", "The science (art) of developing models is a well-studied field and there are even industry reference frameworks for model development such as CRISP-DM , specific EdA methodologies, so for the rest of the article we will assume we have an already trained model with acceptable performance.", "What infrastructure do we need for running Machine Learning at scale?", "In a nutshell, there are three big platforms we need to engineer, apart from of course the development platform where building the initial model, running experiments and so on and also another cross functional platforms such as code repositories, container registries, schedulers or monitoring systems. The platforms are depicted in the following diagram:", "In essence, a feature store decouples the feature engineering process with its usage. This is especially useful for situations where the input data is subject to complex feature transformation logic or where one feature is used by many models, in those scenarios a feature store is an excellent component to engineer since it hides complexity and promotes reusability. However, there are certain scenarios where we can skip this component, for example where the data used for training the model is in its natural state or where the model itself incorporate feature generators (e.g convolutions, bidirectional or embedding layers).", "The feature store is comprised of a number of elements:", "The objective of the training rig is to find and produce the best model (in a specific point in time) given: (i) an initial model architecture, (ii) a set of tunable hyperparameters and a (iii) a historical labeled feature set.", "The next diagram highlights the main components I believe there should be present to ensure a smooth and effective training operation.", "The output of the training rig is what I call the \u201cgolden model\u201d, in other words, the architecture, weight and signature that will be deployed in the inference platform. In order to generate these assets, several components must intervene.", "The main goal of the prediction platform is to execute inferences. The next diagram presents a set of components for achieving that.", "A few components are present in the inference stage:", "Some user journeys enabled by the platform", "There are several journeys that this architecture can articulate, my goal is not to mention all of them, but I would like to highlight a few interesting ones:", "There is a great array of open source software we can use to build a platform with all the components described before, but before thinking on designing each component independently, wouldn\u2019t it be great that we can solve non functional requirements such as scalability, security or portability in a standard and unified way?", "Luckily enough we can rely on kubernetes as the main platform where we deploy our components. The following diagram shows a proposal with a mapping of components with open source products/projects*.", "*FEAST and kubeflow integration is currently work in progress", "To make things even easier, kubeflow already packages all those components in a nice way so much of the integration is already done.", "Even one can think that running a machine learning operation is fundamentally different from a traditional one, most of the software engineering principles actually hold, they are simply applied in a different context. In this article, we have presented a logical high level architecture that can be easily deployed using open source components such as kubeflow.", "I am publishing some components and example notebooks on this topic here.", "Your home for data science.
