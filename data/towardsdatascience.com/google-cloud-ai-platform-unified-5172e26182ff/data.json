Our goal? To show data scientists out there what\u2019s possible, share our personal experience working with the platform, and provide easy to follow, hands-on demonstrations.", "Here are the first two articles in the series:", "So it came as quite a surprise when we noted this rather brief(!) release note from Google Cloud:", "\u201cUnified\u201d we thought. \u201cWhat on earth does that mean?!\u201d. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell us our articles are obsolete before the ink has even dried\u2026\u201d", "Well, the official Google documentation describes it is as:", "\u201cAI Platform (Unified) brings AutoML and AI Platform (Classic) together into a unified API, client library, and user interface.\u201d", "Initially, we were a bit confused with this \u2014 AutoML has always been part of AI Platform, at least in the official documentation. In fact, we had been using this image from Google Cloud to help summarise AI Platform services for a while now. And note it includes AutoML!", "So clearly a bit more investigation was needed.", "I thought I\u2019d start by looking at a recent AutoML Tables Linear Regression model we had trained for a client project. I navigated to the AutoML Tables service via the usual link https://console.cloud.google.com/automl-tables.", "You might be wondering why I use a url instead of searching for it in the Cloud Console service search bar? Well, Google have made this quite hard to find, and searching for \u201cAutoML\u201d, \u201cTables\u201d, \u201cAutoML tables\u201d doesn\u2019t find it!", "Ironically, if you are looking for AutoML Natural Language, again nothing is found if you search for AutoML. Google, please fix this!", "Now the first change; I\u2019m presented with a big banner informing me these services are now available in the AI Platform (Unified).", "Interestingly, this is optional, and all of my models are still displayed as before. I can also still train new models and upload datasets. Although Google advises any new models should be created on the unified version.", "I know, quite a mouthful that one! We assume Google is going to drop the unified thing at some point. Who knows!", "So clicking on the banner above, and here are all of my AutoML Tables models, proudly sitting in their shiny new home.", "Oh, erm, actually they\u2019re not. Where are my models!", "That would be far too easy, wouldn\u2019t it?! It turns out, that all models and datasets need to be migrated from classic to unified. OK, let\u2019s give that a go.", "The first thing to note is Google lists a number of AutoML services that CANNOT be migrated. These are documented here. We were a bit disappointed to see this includes AutoML Natural Language models, as explained here:", "The good news for our AutoML tables models, however, is these are supported. Huray! Although note below, there are some restrictions.", "OK so here\u2019s what I needed to do. These steps and more are available here.", "Tip: Don\u2019t see this? Either you have no resources in that region, or, the resources you do have are not compatible with unified (e.g. an AutoML Text Classification model).", "3. Click the SET UP MIGRATION button.", "4. I now see our AutoML Table models listed. That\u2019s nice and easy so far. Click NEXT.", "5. This takes you to a review page. Here it details what is about to be migrated, in our case, 6 models and 7 datasets.", "Tip: Nice to see that there is no charge for this migration. Another thing we liked, is a copy of your datasets and models is made during the migration process, so at least you can revert back to your original models if required.", "6. Click MIGRATE ASSETS. You should see this banner displayed, informing you the migration is in progress and that it can take up to an hour. An email is sent when complete.", "Migrating our 7 models and 6 datasets took just 1 minute. Nice!", "7. Once complete, simply refresh the page and now you should see your models and datasets in their new home.", "The good news is we really like the new UI for viewing models. We will use one of our linear classification models as an example.", "This was the (classic) AutoML tables view of the model:", "Note the following changes in the new UI:", "At first we thought this must have moved to the new Training item in the main menu in unified. But, clicking on the training pipeline for our model just took us back to the model page. Strange? We\u2019ve asked Google and will see what they say.", "3. The MODELS tab has been replaced with the new MODEL PROPERTIES tab, shown here:", "4. We really like the new EVALUTE tab. Presents the key performance stats on our model really well:", "Tip: The Feature importance (image above) is a great feature of AutoML Tables as it clearly shows how much importance the model is placing on your features. We often see some surprising results (proof that human bias can be flawed!).Great to see this is still here in unified.", "5. The TEST & USE tab in AutoML Tables Classis (below):", "Has been reallocated in Unified as follows:", "TEST & USE / BATCH PREDICTION has moved to its own BATCH PREDICTION tab in Unified.", "TEST & USE / ONLINE PREDICTION has moved to its own DEPLOY AND TEST tab:", "TEST & USE / EXPORT YOUR MODEL has moved to DEPLOY AND TEST (above) and is also available from the new Export link (below):", "This lets you export your model as a Tensorflow model, exported to Cloud Strorage (GCS). This allows you to run predictions via BigQuery ML, which is a great feature that we use a lot as a team.", "AI Platform (Unified) certainly came as a surprise, and I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t be the only people to share this view. At first it was a little confusing from the documentation (and one liner release note!), exactly what unified offered over classic. Hopefully, we\u2019ve saved you some time digging through the documentation and made this a bit clearer for you.", "The migration tool was easy to use, as is hopefully evident from our hand-on example. Once we started to migrate our AutoML models, the rationale to integrate AutoML tighter within the AI Platform started to make sense; and we generally like the changes, especially the cleaner UI and colocation of other AI resources such as the AI Platform Notebooks.", "The training section we are still a little confused with \u2014 so we\u2019ll let you know what we hear back from Google on this one.", "In a follow-up article, we will show you what training a model now looks like in AI Platform Unified, and we\u2019ll compare this with AutoML Tables. Should be interesting!", "1. Keep an eye out for Part 2, where we will explore training a model.", "2. Read the Google Cloud AI Platfrom Unified documentation", "3.
