It inspired by the process of biological evolution based on Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection, where fitter individuals are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. We, as human beings, also are the result of thousands of years of evolution.", "The GA, developed by John Holland and his collaborators in the 1960s and 1970s.", "The GA got popular in the late 1980s by was being applied to a broad range of subjects that are not easy to solve using other techniques.", "In 1992, John Koza has used genetic algorithm to evolve programs to perform certain tasks. He called his method \u201cgenetic programming\u201d (GP)\u00b3.", "For thousands of years, humans have acted as agents of genetic selection, by breeding offspring with desired traits. All our domesticated animals and food crops are the results. Let review the genetic terms in nature as follows.", "Genetic Algorithms are categorized as global search heuristics. A genetic algorithm is a search technique used in computing to find true or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. It uses techniques inspired by biological evolution such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.", "We look at the basic process behind a genetic algorithm as follows.", "Initialize population: genetic algorithms begin by initializing a Population of candidate solutions. This is typically done randomly to provide even coverage of the entire search space. A candidate solution is a Chromosome that is characterized by a set of parameters known as Genes.", "Evaluate: next, the population is evaluated by assigning a fitness value to each individual in the population. In this stage we would often want to take note of the current fittest solution, and the average fitness of the population.", "After evaluation, the algorithm decides whether it should terminate the search depending on the termination conditions set. Usually this will be because the algorithm has reached a fixed number of generations or an adequate solution has been found.", "When the termination condition is finally met, the algorithm will break out of the loop and typically return its finial search results back to the user.", "Selection: if the termination condition is not met, the population goes through a selection stage in which individuals from the population are selected based on their fitness score, the higher the fitness, the better chance an individual has of being selected.", "Two pairs of selected individuals called parents.", "Crossover: the next stage is to apply crossover and mutation to the selected individuals. This stage is where new individuals (children) are created for the next generation.", "Mutation: at this point the new population goes back to the evaluation step and the process starts again. We call each cycle of this loop a generation.", "Now, let\u2019s see how to crack a password using a genetic algorithm. Imagine that a friend asks you to solve the following challenge: \u201cYou must find the three-letter word I set up as a password in my computer\u201d.", "In my example, we\u2019ll start with a password of length 3, with each digit in the password being a letter. An example of password would be: nkA. We will start with a randomly generated initial sequence of letters, then change one random letter at a time until the word is \u201cAnh\u201d.", "At first, we guess any randomly generated words made of three letters, such as \u201cInk, aNj, cDh\u201d. The word Ink and cDh have exactly one letter in common with Anh, the password. We say that they have a score of 1. The word aNj has a score of 0 since it has no any matching letters with the password.", "Since we haven\u2019t found the solution, we can produce a new generation of words by combing some of the word we already have. For example, they are \u201cInh, aDj\". From these two new words, the word Inh has a score of 2 and is very close to the password. We say that this second generation is better than the first second since it is closer to the solution.", "A third-generation can be formed in which the word Inh can produce the word Anh in which the I is randomly mutated into A. This example is pretty simple to understand GA.", "Now, we will implement the example in Python language. Each digit in the password would be considered a Gene. We need a gene set to use for building guesses. For this example that will be a generic set of letters.", "It also needs a target password to guess.", "Next the algorithm needs a way to generate a random string from the gene set.", "The fitness value the genetic algorithm provides is the only feedback the engine gets to guide it toward a solution. In this project the fitness value is the total number of letters in the guess that match the letter in the same position of the password.", "Next, the engine needs a way to produce a new guess by mutating the current one.", "We also need display function to show information. Normally the display function also outputs the fitness value and how much time has elapsed.", "Finally, we will try to run this solution by using the above functions as following.", "Run the above code and we\u2019ll see the following output.", "It\u2019s very easy to understand about genetic algorithms.
