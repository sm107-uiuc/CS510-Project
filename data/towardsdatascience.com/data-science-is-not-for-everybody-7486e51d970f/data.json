I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone from pursuing a career in the field.", "Personally, I think anyone can become a data scientist as long as you put in the right amount of work and time. However, you need to enjoy what you\u2019re doing.", "If you jump into the field and make a hasty career transition with little knowledge of what you\u2019re going into, you could end up wasting years of your life doing something you dislike.", "If you were a creative, artistically inclined person, would you rather pursue a major in arts or science?", "I\u2019m guessing you would pick an art major, because it is something you enjoy doing.", "When I was faced with making this decision, I chose to pursue a career in data science due to all the hype around it. I had little to no idea about what the field entailed.", "Like almost every other student in my data science class, I didn\u2019t do proper research before picking my major.", "Fortunately for me, the decision turned out to be a good one. I genuinely enjoy what I do. But everybody\u2019s different, and a lot of students in my class do regret their decision and want to switch majors.", "As I mentioned above, it all boils down to one thing. Whether or not you are passionate about what you do.", "In this article, I will break down the field of data science. I will give you a clear description of what the field really is about, without bringing up the estimated salary you can get or the job prospects.", "I will explain the different career paths you can pursue within data science, and describe what each of these fields entails.", "If any of these roles seem appealing to you, then you should definitely pursue data science regardless of your career or education background.", "Disclaimer: \u201cData scientist\u201d is an umbrella term used to describe various different roles. These roles are interchangeable, and may differ based on the organization you go to. This is just a brief overview of some of the most common data science roles.", "If you haven\u2019t heard before, \u201creal world data is messy.\u201d It is collected from a variety of different sources \u2014 your mobile phones, CCTV\u2019s, and other devices.", "This data is unstructured. It needs to be cleaned and pipelined, and stored in a structured format so that data scientists and analysts can work on it.", "A data engineer doesn\u2019t need to know machine learning or data analysis. Their job is to create an infrastructure to manage big data.", "Skills: Typically, a data engineer needs to write very complex queries to manage large datasets. Due to this, they need to know a querying language very well. Depending on the company they\u2019re working with, this can be an SQL or NoSQL language.", "A data analyst is the person who derives insights from the data that has been cleaned by the data engineer.", "The analyst looks for patterns and outliers in the data, and derives meaning, in order to answer complex data questions.", "The role of an analyst in a company:", "Picture this \u2014 Company A sells candy. They want to know if there were any changes in candy sales during the lockdown period.", "The analyst will then query the data, and take a look at trends in candy sales before, during, and after the lockdown.", "In order to present this data, the analyst can also come up with visualizations \u2014 charts and graphs depicting an increase or decrease in candy sales.", "This is a very elementary example, but is sufficient to describe the role of a data analyst in a company.", "A data analyst might also be required to have some business domain knowledge, in order to understand client\u2019s requests and deliver according to their needs.", "An analyst doesn\u2019t need to have machine learning knowledge, and will not need to create or do any kind of predictive modelling.", "Skills: An analyst needs to know a querying language, which will differ based on the company they are in. Knowledge of one or more programming language is vital. The main task of an analyst is deriving insights from data, so it isn\u2019t necessary to create or write to data tables. Knowledge of visualization tools will be useful.", "Tools: MySQL, Hive, Python, Tableau, Excel, PowerBI (these will differ based on the company you work for).", "A data scientist is the person who applies machine learning techniques to come up with predictive models.", "This is the person who designs algorithms and comes up with predictions based on data provided. They build statistical models, and do things like creating recommendation systems or fraud detection.", "Depending on the company they are in, a data scientist may also be expected to have the skills of an analyst \u2014 the ability to take in business requests, derive insights, and come up with visualizations.", "The term data science unicorn is being thrown around very frequently these days.", "A data science unicorn is a person who is capable of:", "In summary, a data science unicorn is someone who knows machine learning and data analytics, has domain knowledge, and is capable of communicating their insights.", "However, in most data driven companies, these jobs are separated. The main task of a data scientist is to make machine learning models and come up with predictions.", "Skills: One or more programming languages, strong mathematical background, statistics, machine learning.", "Tools: R, Python (packages such as Caret and Scikit-Learn).", "There are a lot more roles that come into play in the data science lifecycle, including machine learning engineers and the business insights team.", "I focused on the three main ones, but you should do your research about other roles before making a career decision.", "All the roles I mentioned above require some knowledge of programming and querying, which can be learnt easily. You can refer to this article I wrote on learning how to code for data science.", "Data engineering is probably the most technical out of these three roles, and is more programming heavy than any of them. If you are more inclined towards programming and know the ins and outs of databases, you should consider becoming a data engineer.", "The role of a data scientist is more mathematically heavy. If you like math and have an interest in building a strong foundation in statistics, you should consider becoming a data scientist. You will need a stronger academic background, and spend more time studying if you\u2019d like to become a data scientist. You will need to know some programming (in R or Python), and use packages to build machine learning models.", "Finally, a data analyst is someone who needs to derive and present insights from data. To become an analyst, you will need to know how to query data and find insights to match your client\u2019s needs. This is probably the most creative of all three fields. You will need to translate a business request into insights, and create visualizations. You might also need to present these insights to a client. If you are a creative person with good presentation and communication skills, then data analytics might be for you.", "That\u2019s all for this article! If you are looking to transition into the field of data science, I hope this breakdown helped you understand the role of a data scientist better.", "Ten years down the road, a new field will emerge that will become the new craze.", "You want to wake up every morning looking forward to your job, and not dreading it.
