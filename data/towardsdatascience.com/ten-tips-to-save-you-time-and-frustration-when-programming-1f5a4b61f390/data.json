My survey of my data science students shows me this story is far from unusual.", "Many false starts are due in part to the slow and tedious process of learning to code and the frustration that accompanies it. Consequently, I\u2019m passionate about removing the unnecessary obstacles that prevent people from becoming competent coders. There will always be obstacles, but there\u2019s no reason for unnecessary obstacles. \ud83d\ude01", "Here are 10 tips to help you more quickly leap over the hurdles and achieve a sense of competency. Many of these tips might seem minor or obvious to you if you\u2019ve been coding for years, but when starting out, nothing is obvious. And even if you\u2019ve been coding since cell phones were called car phones, there might be a tip or two that will save you time. \ud83c\udf89", "This is such a big topic that doesn\u2019t get enough attention that I was debating writing a whole article on it. Instead, here\u2019s a bonus section \u2014 a 5-step plan to resolve errors faster.", "Every programmer see lots of errors. Once you\u2019re experienced, most don\u2019t cause more than a shrug, because you can resolve them in under a minute.", "However, when you are starting out, an error might take take 20 times longer to resolve. To a beginner, errors can make you feel like you\u2019re trudging through ankle-deep mud.", "Here\u2019s a game plan for resolving 95% of errors quickly.", "3. Filter the online resources to separate the wheat from the chaff. \ud83c\udf3e Here area few heuristics to help you find higher quality resources faster. \ud83d\ude00", "Stack Overflow, Medium, Reddit, Hacker News, Dev and other online communities have feedback indicators such as upvotes or claps to show which content is on target. These metrics aren\u2019t perfect, but they generally work pretty well. Stack Overflow, the Towards Data Science Medium publication, GitHub issues for the repo in question, and the official docs for a language or library are the sites where I find the most solutions.", "It\u2019s hit or miss with the quality of blogs in Google search results. If you\u2019re using Python, I can suggest some good sites based on my experience:", "4. Avoid older resources. For most problems, you want resources that aren\u2019t more than a few years old. When searching for a solution to an error on Google, filter out old results \u2014 either by time-boxing the search parameters or informally when looking over the resulting snippets.", "If you\u2019re starting out in Python, content about Python 2 from 2009 is unlikely to help you. \ud83d\udc0d", "APIs evolve and how things were done is often not the recommended way to do them today. You are more likely to find an applicable answer in relatively recent results. \ud83d\udcc6", "If your initial forays are unsuccessful, then it\u2019s worth looking through older posts and lower-quality sites on the next pass.", "5. Learn what error codes mean. Here\u2019s a list of common error codes and explanations for Python. And here\u2019s a really nice flow chart to help you tackle common Python errors.", "If you use the Python pandas library for data manipulation, there are common errors. Here\u2019s a GitHub Gist I made with a Jupyter notebook of common errors and how to resolve them:", "It would be great if Python and pandas provided really helpful error messages that included explanations of the likely cause of the errors.

It might not be fast or easy, but hopefully this article will make it a bit less frustrating.", "If you found this helpful, please share it on your favorite social media so other people can find it, too.", "I write about Python, Docker, data science, and more.
