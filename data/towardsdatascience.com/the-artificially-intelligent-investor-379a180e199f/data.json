While these projects are intriguing, I wanted to find a more practical use for text generation and decided to explore if RNNs could form coherent investing advice. After considering a few options, I chose to train the model on a copy of The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, which has been quoted by Warren Buffet as \u201cthe best book on investing ever written\u201d. The model\u2019s output certainly didn\u2019t reveal the secret to beating the market as we\u2019ll later see, but it\u2019s still interesting to ponder if AI will one day be capable of offering sound financial advice.", "RNNs are analogous to human learning. When humans think, we don\u2019t start our thinking from scratch each second. For example, in the sentence \u201cBob plays basketball\u201d, we know that Bob is the person who plays basketball because we retain information about past words while reading sentences. Similarly, RNNs are neural networks with feedback loops, which allow them to use past information before arriving at a final output. However, RNNs can only connect recent information and cannot connect older information as the time gap grows. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are an improved version of RNNs that overcome the short-term memory issue through an update gate that decides what information is relevant to pass on and a reset gate that decides what past information is irrelevant. For an in-depth explanation of GRUs, click here.", "Author\u2019s Note: Definition of RNNs reused from my previous article \u201cMachine Learning to Predict Stock Prices\u201d", "To start off, we make the necessary imports: Tensorflow, Numpy, and os.", "Next step is to download our data, which is a .txt file of the Intelligent Investor. I removed the preface, index and a few graphs from the file to help our model generate more relevant text. Once we download the file, we take a look at how many total characters are in it.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how many unique characters exist in the file.", "Our model can\u2019t understand letters so we have to vectorize the text. Each unique character is mapped to an integer for the computer to understand and integers are mapped to the characters so we can later decode the computer\u2019s output.", "We train the RNN model with the goal of teaching it to predict the most likely character after a given sequence of characters. To do this we will break input sequences from the text into an example sequence and target sequence. The target sequence is the example sequence shifted one character to the right, so the chunks of text have to be one character longer than the length of sequence. For example, if our text is \u201cStocks\u201d, the example sequence would be \u201cStock\u201d and the target sequence would be \u201ctocks\u201d.", "We shuffle the data and segment it into batches before we train our model. The purpose of shuffling the data is to improve the performance of the model by avoiding overfitting, which is when the model learns the training data too closely and can\u2019t generalize well to the test set.", "With the data prepared for training, we create our model with three layers.", "Now, we compile our model with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross entropy loss function.", "Before we train our model, we make sure to save checkpoints during training. By saving checkpoints, we can quickly recreate our model with a different batch size and restore the saved weights instead of training it again.", "Rebuild our model and load the weights with the batch size changed to 1, which makes the prediction simpler.", "Here comes the moment of truth: our model finally reveals its investing advice! The temperature parameter affects the outputs we receive: a lower temperature results in a more conservative output while a higher temperature results in a more creative output that is prone to making more errors. We\u2019ll see examples of this below.", "Here\u2019s the advice our model generates at a temperature of 0.1.", "While the output isn\u2019t even remotely close to any investing advice you should follow, it does a decent job of mimicking The Intelligent Investor. Due to the low temperature, our model doesn\u2019t attempt to be creative and plays it safe by sticking to standard sentences in paragraph format. Let\u2019s see how this changes as we increase the temperature.", "At a temperature of 0.5, we can begin to see differences in the output. Our model tries to be more inventive and makes more errors as a result. An example of this is in the second to last line where parentheses are used incorrectly.", "Now, the differences at a temperature of 1 are very apparent as our model attempts to generate tables. However, the tradeoff for this increased creativity is that the output becomes mostly incomprehensible. I\u2019ve included a few more outputs at the various temperatures for reference.", "As we saw, RNNs aren\u2019t anywhere close to replacing investment advisors for now.
