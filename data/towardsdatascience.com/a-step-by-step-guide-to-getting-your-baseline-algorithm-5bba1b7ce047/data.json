Once you\u2019ve successfully imported your files, observe the amount of columns you have, the amount of rows, what your column names are, etc. Taking a closer look, examine the individual column names, is it clear what kind of data you\u2019re looking at? Why or why not? Start with a high level conceptual look at your data before you begin to dig into specifics. It is important to have an idea of how everything is connected, even if you find your data to be particularly \u2018dirty\u2019 or unclear.", "Identify if it\u2019s numerical or categorical. What are your variable types? Is it normally distributed? If data is categorical, is your data ordinal or nominal? If your data is numerical, are your numerical values discrete or continuous? I recommend noting this info, in your Jupyter Notebook for instance, by commenting it out (with the #comment here).", "Identify if your data has any outliers. In order to make proper calculations on your data, you\u2019ll need to normalize it as closely as you can. Getting rid of extraneous data points will help your data structure from being too skewed.", "Identify missing values (if any). Typically we use the mean, sometimes median or mode to give us the best values to fill in any blanks within our dataset.", "Split the data either 80/20 or 75/25 where 80% or 75% is your training set and 20% or 25% is your test set. You don\u2019t want to train your algorithm on everything you have- your algorithm needs fresh, raw data to test from. We use the sample to test the model on something new (the model has not seen this data before). We establish our predictive results based on the training dataset. By comparing our predictive results to test dataset, we can measure the true strength of the algorithm.", "Normalize and \u2018clean\u2019 the training data.

While this method can be viewed as more tedious, it is considered best practice to clean your test data set separate from your training data set \u2014 it helps you avoid overfitting. Overfitting is an error that occurs in your model when your predictive data is too closely fit to your historic data.", "Modeling Phase.

Take the test result and compare that against the true values. The act of comparing your predictions against the true values is classified as evaluating your model. Once compared, we see how far off we are (ie. the accuracy score metric tells us how far off). If your evaluation is below your threshold, you should be happy! If your predicted results are extremely off, perhaps you\u2019re seeing an extremely high accuracy score on the first run, you\u2019ll have to go back and check your data and any adjustments made. When you\u2019re not seeing the metrics you\u2019re hoping for, address your concern internally first, check how you cleaned the data to make sure you didn\u2019t miss anything. Try a different algorithm, play around with any functions or new columns or datasets you may have made. Once you can confidently confirm that your process and algorithm are sound, then look externally to source different data- perhaps there\u2019s some open source data that could support your predictive model?", "Feature Engineering. If you exhausted all different types of data and exhausted all different types of algorithms, then begin feature engineering. It is best practice to only star feature engineering once you start your second round. Make a copy of your notebook and start to rework your model on your duplicate copy so you can compare and contrast your process difference with your output difference. Creating new features is not a practice to be done lightly so keep working at it, and spend your time evaluating.", "Put together your findings and analysis.
