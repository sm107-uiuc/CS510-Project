This probably sounds like an absurd, if not outrageous question. From a data science perspective, however, it\u2019s no less legitimate than any other hypothesized correlation of the sort that academic researchers and industry analysts examine every day. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think the answer is; all that matters is whether you can back up your position with data and statistics. In this regard, astrology provides a wonderful source of data-science case studies, since, behind all of its colorful superstitions, astrology\u2019s most provocative questions are really just data questions. Putting astrology to the test, therefore, can be a great way to showcase the basics of statistical inference, computational data analysis, and, given the strong reactions it evokes, how to set aside your personal biases when examining a controversial topic. (Disclaimer: I do not believe in astrology!)", "Besides, if you think about it, astrology and data science have much more in common than either discipline might like to admit. Both believe that meaningful inferences about individuals and groups can be drawn from numerical data. And both have an unfortunate track record of producing extremely complicated, highly specific, and yet wildly inaccurate predictive models. With astrology, there\u2019s simply a curious insistence that the coordinates of the Sun, Moon, and planets are always the most relevant factors.", "The connection between ancient astrology and modern data science is one I explore in my new book, A SCHEME OF HEAVEN: The History of Astrology and the Search for Our Destiny in Data (W. W. Norton, Jan. 2020). My basic thesis is that that astrologers were the original data scientists, with all the good and bad this entails, and that even today \u2014 or, rather, especially today \u2014 we still grapple with many of the same pattern-matching pitfalls when generating and interpreting numerical forecasts. As I write in my book,", "\u201cAstrologers were the quants and data scientists of their day, and those of us who are enthusiastic about the promise of numerical data to unlock the secrets of ourselves and our world would do well simply to acknowledge that others have come this way before.\u201d", "As a case in point, the question of whether individuals can be labeled by personality type, and whether these types are suited to specific occupations, has been of interest for literally thousands of years. Which brings us back to the issue at hand: Do any professions show a correlation with the zodiac? In order to answer this, we\u2019ll need three things:", "For this project, I made use of the standard Python data-science packages of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, along with BeautifulSoup for web scraping. Each step is relatively straightforward, however, and should be easily adapted to other languages such as R, Scala, or Julia.", "These days, there is no shortage of birthday data available online; the only limit is your curiosity and your web-scraping abilities. In A SCHEME OF HEAVEN, my investigation of occupational correlations with the zodiac was motivated by a discussion of an ancient astrological poem called the Astronomica, the work of a Roman astrologer named Marcus Manilius who lived around the time of Christ. Despite its comparatively late date \u2060 \u2014 late, that is, given astrology\u2019s Babylonian origins \u2060 \u2014 the Astronomica is actually the oldest extended treatment of astrology and its methods to survive from antiquity. It also contains the oldest description of zodiac personality types. Many of these would still be recognizable in a magazine horoscope today. Tauri, for instance, seem to have been just as slow and stubborn in Roman times, and Libras just as legalistic.", "The professions Manilius associates with each zodiac sign are based largely on the sign itself; Pisces, for instance, are said to make excellent sailors, and Libras top-notch judges. Yet the most interesting findings, as I soon discovered, come from the world of professional sports.", "Professional athletes are great subjects for a zodiac analysis since their extraordinary talents make them inherently fascinating, and their fame, in turn, makes their birthdays very easy to find on the web. And you don\u2019t have to worry about sample bias issues, either, since you can typically get birthdates for the entire population of everyone who has ever played the sport. For professional hockey, the website HockeyDB.com is an unrivaled treasure trove. Conveniently for us, HockeyDB lists the birthdays of every player in the National Hockey League (NHL) on alphabetized webpages. With a just a few lines of html parsing using BeautifulSoup, therefore, I was able to retrieve a list of birthdates for over seven thousand current a former NHL players and store these in a Pandas dataframe.", "The next step in our analysis is to map birthdates to zodiac signs. This can be done with a dataframe apply that takes, as inputs, an individual\u2019s birth year, month, and day, and compares these to a previously computed table of zodiac start-dates. The principal difficulty is that these zodiac start-dates change a little depending on the year. For instance, the winter solstice, which marks the beginning of Capricorn, occurred on December 22 in 2019, but will occur on December 21 in 2020.", "In my experience, I find that everyone, whatever their feelings about astrology may be, knows their own zodiac sign. Yet very few people know how these are defined. In fact, these astrological quantities are determined according to a purely astronomical calculation. And despite bearing the names of constellations, the zodiac signs have nothing do with the stars; instead, they indicate the position of the Sun along its apparent orbit as seen from the Earth. More specifically, the twelve zodiac signs indicate the integer division of the Sun\u2019s ecliptic longitude by 30 degrees. For example, at the astronomical spring equinox, the Sun has ecliptic longitude 0\u00b0, which marks the beginning of the zodiac sign of Aries. Taurus begins at ecliptic longitude 30\u00b0, Gemini at 60\u00b0, and so on.", "Knowing this isn\u2019t the same as being able to calculate it, however. For anyone with an interest in computational astronomy, I highly recommend Jean Meeus\u2019s indispensable book, Astronomical Algorithms (Willmann-Bell, 1998), which provides formulas for computing the Sun\u2019s coordinates at any epoch. Yet a much simpler and more accurate approach is to query this information directly from NASA itself, via their HORIZONS online ephemeris system. This service, maintained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, provides public access to the same, high-precision astronomical data used by spacecraft for interplanetary navigation. Delving into the details of the HORIZONS API would be a topic for another article, but their web interface, in particular, is refreshingly user-friendly.", "To determine the zodiac start-dates for a given year, all you need to do is query the ecliptic longitude of the Sun at intervals of a day, or, for more precision, at every hour. The twelve zodiac signs begin on the dates where this quantity passes through an even increment of 30\u00b0. This method is, admittedly, somewhat inefficient, since, if the Sun\u2019s position is queried just once for each day, then, for any given year, either 365 or 366 values are needed to identify just twelve calendar dates. Nevertheless, the advantage of this approach is that it\u2019s accurate and, after you\u2019ve computed it once, you never need to compute it again.", "The result of step 1 is a data frame of current and former NHL players, indexed by player last name, with columns for various stats including the player\u2019s birthday. The result of step 2 is to add a new column in the data frame listing each player\u2019s zodiac sign. A simple group-by and count operation generates the summary table, below, which we can also plot as a histogram (Fig. 1).", "Table 1 contains the data we will use to examine whether or not certain zodiac signs are overrepresented among professional hockey players. But how? Simply looking at the histogram won\u2019t do, no matter how suggestive it may appear, since looks can be very deceiving, especially when the sample sizes are small. A quantitative statistical test is needed to give us more information.", "Fortunately \u2014 and yet another reason why a zodiac analysis like this makes such a great way to teach statistics \u2014 our question about zodiac signs can be recast as a textbook statistical hypothesis test. In fact, we can use one of the very first statistical tests ever devised: Karl Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test. Pearson\u2019s test, which he refined throughout the 1890s, was initially applied to assess the fairness of coin flips, dice rolls, and, famously, the roulette tables of Monte Carlo (which, he discovered, weren\u2019t fair at all) [1]. In the amazing way in which mathematics often reveals that two seemingly dissimilar problems are actually the same, it turns out that our question about zodiac signs is mathematically identical to examining the fairness of a 12-sided die.", "Rephrased as a hypothesis test, our null hypothesis, H\u2080, is that there is no correlation between the birthdates of professional hockey players and any particular zodiac sign. More specifically, we\u2019ll define H\u2080 as the assertion that the underlying distribution of NHL players\u2019 zodiac signs is uniform \u2014 that is, the probability of an NHL player having a specific zodiac sign is the same as for any other sign, namely, 1/12. Under H\u2080, whatever deviation from perfect uniformity we see in our data can be explained as most likely having arisen from random noise. The alternative hypothesis, H\u2081, asserts that the observed deviation from uniformity is sufficiently large that it is very unlikely to have arisen from random noise.", "Note that our null assumption of a uniform distribution has the advantage that we don\u2019t need to test for correlation with each and every zodiac sign; in this respect, it\u2019s as if we are getting twelve tests for the price of one.", "To perform Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test, we need to know three quantities:", "Pearson\u2019s \u03c7\u00b2Pearson\u2019s chi-squared statistic, \u03c7\u00b2, which may be familiar to anyone who has taken a college level laboratory test is computed as follows:", "This form can be derived as an extension of the binomial distribution to the multinomial case. In the limit of large numbers, the results in each category approach a normal (Gaussian) distribution centered around that category\u2019s expected value. Pearson\u2019s chi-squared statistic, which is the sum of the squares of these quasi-normally distributed values, then approaches a true chi-squared distribution.", "Under the null hypothesis, H\u2080, the players\u2019 birthdates are distributed uniformly across the twelve zodiac signs, so the expected value for each category is simply N, the sample size, divided evenly by the number of categories, namely, 12. In our case, the sample size, N, is 7,417. Therefore, the expected number of NHL players per zodiac sign is 7,417 / 12 = 618.1. (This is a rather unphysical number of hockey players, to be sure, but one that is of no concern to the statistician.) Using this value, and plugging the measured counts from Table 1 directly into Equation 1, yields:", "The degrees of freedom, \u03bdIn our example, there are 12 possible outcomes for a player\u2019s zodiac sign, and therefore 11 degrees of freedom", "The significance level, \u03b1The value of \u03b1 is a parameter we get to choose. The standard significance level used in social science research is 0.05. This means that any value of \u03c7\u00b2 which, under the null hypothesis, is expected to occur less than 5% of the time is labeled \u201csignificant\u201d. In particle physics, by contrast, the standard significance level is 1 / 3.5 million.", "Whether a \u201csignificant\u201d result is meaningful or interesting is a judgment left entirely to the discretion of the tester. This sleight of hand is the source of much mischief in many research studies and a major contributor to the replication crisis in the social sciences. It\u2019s also, I argue, a commonality that modern statistics shares with astrology, where complicated algorithms provide a cloak of objectivity for conclusions that are actually deeply subjective. For our purposes, we simply note that a significant outcome of any statistical test serves mainly as suggestive indicator of where to look deeper. It is not a sufficient condition, nor is it even a necessary condition to support a conclusion.", "Performing the TestWe now have the three ingredients we need to conduct Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test. Referring back to Equation 1, it\u2019s clear that the closer our measured counts are to the expected counts, the smaller our \u03c7\u00b2 will be. Conversely, the more lopsided our sample is, the larger our \u03c7\u00b2 will be. So where does our result, 143.8, fit in? This is the specific question answered by Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test.", "To proceed, we simply compare Pearson\u2019s chi-squared statistic, \u03c7\u00b2, computed from our data, against a standard table of critical values, given the parameters \u03bd and \u03b1. For a test with \u03bd = 11 and \u03b1 = 0.05, the upper-tail critical value is listed as 19.675. Our measured value, 143.8, is well above this critical value, meaning that, under the null hypothesis of uniformly distributed zodiac signs, we would not expect to obtain this result by chance more than 5% of the time. Our result, therefore, qualifies as a \u201csignificant\u201d outcome to the test. This, in turn, suggests that there is statistical justification for rejecting the null hypothesis of uniformly distributed zodiac signs.", "In other words, the evidence indicates that, yes, professional hockey players are more likely to have certain zodiac signs than others.", "Are you surprised by this result? I certainly was. But the value of good data analysis is that it is capable of revealing something you didn\u2019t know before; otherwise, the whole exercise is nothing more than an elaborate way to justify what you already believed. Yet the outcome of a statistical hypothesis test, as we asserted above, is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for drawing any sort of meaningful inference about the world. Instead, what these tests offer is a handy way to identify topics deserving a deeper look. Which certainly applies to a result as strange as ours, one that seems to imply that your zodiac sign is somehow connected with your hockey prowess.", "What I discovered upon further research was that this phenomenon, which has absolutely nothing to do with the stars or planets, has been known and studied for several decades [2]. It\u2019s called the relative age effect, and it\u2019s quite common in sports that rely on competitive youth leagues with strict age cutoffs.", "Junior hockey leagues, for example, typically group players according to the calendar year of their birth. This means that a player born on January 1 will be almost a full year older than his teammate born on December 31, even though both belong to the same age cohort. For players who are nine or ten years old, that difference represents an enormous developmental advantage, both physically and mentally. And since only the best players from any given year are likely to continue on to the next level, the cumulative effect is a system that progressively weeds out Sagittarii, Scorpios, and Libras in favor of Capricorns, Aquarii, and Pisces, even before these players ever reach the pros. The end result, as Figure 1 shows, is striking.", "A similar bias is also seen in Major League Baseball, whose players skew toward August birthdays, and the National Football League, whose players skew toward January birthdays. Interestingly, in basketball, where organized youth leagues are less important, no relative age effect is observed.", "Does the relative age effect show up anywhere outside of sports? The school year in most places has a fall cutoff, and some studies claim a bias can be found in academic achievement, job success, and a whole host of other metrics which ripple down through our lives. If so, then the effect is a small one. Yet it\u2019s the enticing possibility of discovering a previously unknown example of the relative age effect that makes analyzing the zodiac signs of different professions such a fun data-science diversion.", "Beyond the occupations already discussed, I\u2019ve looked at Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Supreme Court Justices, Olympic sailors, and English footballers. For none of these groups did the data support rejecting the hypothesis of birthdates distributed uniformly throughout the year. (Note, of course, that by adopting a significance level of 0.05, or 1 out of 20, I\u2019m ensuring that, on average, 1 out of 20 of these investigations will produce a significant outcome purely by chance.) I am aware of one other large and well-known population whose birthdays exhibit a marked, non-uniform pattern, but I\u2019ll leave that discussion for another time \u2014 or you can read about it in my book!", "In the end, my hope is that this exercise offers a charmingly memorable example of how statistics and data science can help us understand the world in which we live. With data, you can never quite predict exactly what you\u2019ll find. And this, to me, makes its revelatory powers much more exciting than anything promised by astrology.", "[1] Adam Kucharski, The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math are Taking the Luck out of Gambling (New York: Basic Books, 2016), 4\u20137.", "Your home for data science.
