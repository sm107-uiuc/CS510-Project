Unfortunately there is just so much news\u00b9 that it is almost impossible for us to escape our tiny filter bubbles.", "Luckily, the same technology that got us into this mess, can help us navigate it. Using computers, it\u2019s possible to get a broad view of multiple news sources and to see what areas they focus on most. It\u2019s also fun to see how the writing styles of different outlets differ. While we\u2019ll need many more advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to really get a handle on news bias, there are some fun analyses we can do now.", "Towards that end, I\u2019ve used the python Newspaper library\u00b2 to collect as many articles as I could from 21 differnet news outlets over the past 6 months. Here are some interesting ways that they differ.", "One of the easy and interesting things to look at when it comes to news is story sentiment. Using the python VADER library\u00b3, we can score all stories from different publications and measure what their average sentiment is. Positive numbers indicate more upbeat language, while negative scores suggest dark and negative writing.", "As expected, the fluff of USA today scores quite positive, while the conspiracy theories on Infowars are the mostly negative. Surprisingly, most news articles are not strictly negative (although Russia Today, Breitbart and Buzzfeed seem to skew that way).", "If we look just at news headlines, we see that they are more negative than story content. Bad news gets more attention after all. Again, Inforwars headlines are the most negative while only the Wall Street Journal score positive.", "Another simple measure of news writing is its readability. There are multiple systems that have been developed over the years to measure how easy something is to read. Below I\u2019ve used the python textstat library\u2074 to compare the reading difficulty of various publications.", "The Flesch-Kincaid readabilty test is one of the most popular. It creates a score based on the number of words per sentence and on the number of syllables per word \u2014 i.e. long words and sentence are harder to read. It then converts this score to a grade level. Note that this result has nothing to do with the content of the sentences analyzed. It is solely based on the length of words/sentences.", "Using this method, we see that MSNBC has the highest grade level making it the hardest to read. This is likely because MSNBC \u2018stories\u2019 are just descriptions of the news videos on the site. They are designed to be descriptive, not necessarily readable. All other sites contain proper articles, even network news sites like CNN and FoxNews.", "At the opposite end of the spectrum, BBC news articles can be read comfortably, requiring only a 10th grade education. This is likely because most BBC stories are short and informative (with fewer meandering editorials).", "The Dale-Chall formula uses words lengths, but also takes the difficulty of the those words into account. It keeps a list of \u201ceasy words\u201d that a 4th grader should understand. Using this method, the more words that aren\u2019t on this list, the harder something is to read.", "Based on this system, we again see that MSNBC is the least readable. Except now the New York Times (NYT) and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) move up the list with scores around 8. This means they require an 11th or 12th grade education to fully comprehend.", "The Smog grading system uses the number of polysyllables (words with 3 or more syllables) to assign a difficulty grade. Here again we see MSNBC , Breitbart, and Politico use the most long words, while the BBC and LA Times use simpler language.", "The Gunning fog index also uses words with many syllables as a measure of reading difficulty, but the formula is different. With this new method, USA Today takes the top spot as easiest to read.", "Finally, though not a strict readability test, we can get a sense of the complexity of a news outlet\u2019s reporting by measuring how long its stories are.", "Note \u2014 some news sites are paywalled so it wasn\u2019t always possible to scrape full stories. Also some websites require clicking \u201cread more\u201d buttons to get the full text. These sources have been removed.", "We see that Vox, with their mission to explain the news, has by far the longest articles (1427 words). Politico and Buzzfeed are next with averages around 1000 words per story. If we could included paywalled sites, the New York Times, LA Times, and Washington Post, they would also be close to 1500 words/article.", "Personally, I think that the New York Post is the perfect paper and that 500 words is just right for reporting. Editorials tend to be longer.", "Unfortunately NLP tools are not yet advanced enough to easily suss out political biases. Nevertheless we can get an idea of an outlet\u2019s political slant by looking at its headlines. Below are word clouds based on the frequency of terms used in them (large words are the ones that are used most often).", "The three main national news outlets seem to be mostly Trump coverage machines (I do worry about their future business models). The Kavanaugh confirmation stories are the second most popular with all three sources, while the Mueller investigation is also very big on MSNBC.", "The word clouds for the other major news sources are similar. While they are all obsessed with Trump, they also cover other subjects. The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post have many stories about Saudi Arabia, while the New York Times has lots of #MeToo coverage (\u2018accused\u2019, \u2018man\u2019, \u2018sex\u2019). NPR still talks Trump a lot, but USA Today spends most of its ink on \u201cbest deals\u201d stories. Meanwhile, the BBC is rightly focussed on Brexit and global politics.", "We can also see that newer internet-only publications have a better spread of coverage (except for Politico). The Huffington Post seems to have lots of Greek and Spanish articles, so results were mixed up with words from other languages. Vox\u2019s main stories are \u2018explainers\u2019 (on the usual topics of Trump, Saudi Arabia and Kavanaugh) while Breitbart and the Daily Caller devote a lot of coverage to the US-Mexico \u2018border\u2019. Finally, local papers like the LA Times, Boston Globe and New York Post focus on local news (\u2018California\u2019, \u2018Boston\u2019, \u2018NYC\u2019) in addition to Trump. They also have lots of old-fashioned general interest stories (\u2018home\u2019, \u2018school\u2019, \u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019 terms are common).", "Since \u2018Trump\u2019 is the dominant item in the news, I thought it would be fun to see how he is viewed by different outlets. Using a technique called Word2Vec\u2079 it is possible to see what words are considered similar to Trump by news outlets.", "Below we see that the words surrounding \u2018Trump\u2019 are similar to the ones used to describe \u2018Obama\u2019, \u2018Bush\u2019, \u2018Putin\u2019, \u2018Xi\u2019 (Jinping), \u2018Bolsonaro\u2019, \u2018Duterte\u2019, and \u2018Macron\u2019. It seems that both outlets on the left and right equate Trump with strong (or maybe militant) leaders around the globe.", "Note \u2014 the fun fact that Neil \u2018Gaiman\u2019 got mixed into these results shows that this technique may not be well suited for this type of analysis.", "The words that we read most these days are from internet news sites. These publications have a huge influence on what we see, what we think, and how we feel. And yet they answer only to rich benefactors or to their bottom lines. Technology has created this inredibly competitve media landscsape. Maybe technology can also help us to move through it more thoughtfully.", "As a writer, I\u2019ve always wondered what the ideal sentence length is. Based on the average number of words in a news headline, the answer is somewhere between 10 and 14 words. This is the length that all news outlets use to draw in those clicks.", "We can also measure the number of words in the average sentence of a news article. Here we see that most are between 21 and 26 words. This feel a bit long to me, but my background involves more technical and business writing. Reporters with English majors are likely more long-winded.", "For fun, I saved the news headlines with the absolute worst sentiment scores. The ones below reflect the darkest stories of the last 6 months.", "As I described above, most readability tests are very simple. They don\u2019t measure anything about how sentences are constructed or how words are used. I wanted to see how these tests graded what I consider to be truly bad writing. For this purpose, I selected the last 5 articles from the notoriously inscrutable New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. His scores are below.", "average Flesh-Kincaid grade level \u2014 12.1", "Based on how idiosyncratic Friedman\u2019s writing style is, I think the Smog grade is the most accurate. You definitely need a college degree to get at whatever he\u2019s trying to say.", "And in case you\u2019re wondering, this article has the following readability scores:", "All code and data (minus copyrighted news stories) on GitHub at https://github.com/taubergm/news_readability", "1 \u2014 \u201cThere are2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day\u201d", "3 \u2014 VADER Sentiment Analysis. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.", "I had to fix a minor bug in this library associated with counting the number of words in a sentence. I replaced the sentence_count() function with my own implementation using an nltk tokenizer", "5 \u2014 Flech-Kincade score before converted to grade level", "9 \u2014 From wikipedia. Word2Vec models \u201care shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words\u201d.
