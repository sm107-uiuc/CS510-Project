If the two distributions which we are comparing are exactly equal then the points on the Q-Q plot will perfectly lie on a straight line y = x.", "\u201cDraw graph, draw line, tell me if you think it's fine!\u201d \u2014 Josh Starmer", "Yes, it's just that simple. Being a data scientist or in general a statistician, it\u2019s very important for you to know whether the distribution is normal or not so as to apply various statistical measures on the data and interpret it in much more human-understandable visualization and there Q-Q plot comes into the picture. The most fundamental question answered by Q-Q plot is:", "Q-Q plots are used to find the type of distribution for a random variable whether it be a Gaussian Distribution, Uniform Distribution, Exponential Distribution or even Pareto Distribution, etc. You can tell the type of distribution using the power of the Q-Q plot just by looking at the plot. In general, we are talking about Normal distributions only because we have a very beautiful concept of 68\u201395\u201399.7 rule which perfectly fits into the normal distribution So we know how much of the data lies in the range of first standard deviation, second standard deviation and third standard deviation from the mean. So knowing if a distribution is Normal opens up new doors for us to experiment with the data easily. Secondly, Normal Distributions occur very frequently in most of the natural events which have a vast scope.", "We plot the theoretical quantiles or basically known as the standard normal variate (a normal distribution with mean=0 and standard deviation=1)on the x-axis and the ordered values for the random variable which we want to find whether it is Gaussian distributed or not, on the y-axis. Which gives a very beautiful and a smooth straight line like structure from each point plotted on the graph.", "Now we have to focus on the ends of the straight line. If the points at the ends of the curve formed from the points are not falling on a straight line but indeed are scattered significantly from the positions then we cannot conclude a relationship between the x and y axes which clearly signifies that our ordered values which we wanted to calculate are not Normally distributed.", "If all the points plotted on the graph perfectly lies on a straight line then we can clearly say that this distribution is Normally distribution because it is evenly aligned with the standard normal variate which is the simple concept of Q-Q plot.", "Q-Q plots are also used to find the Skewness (a measure of \u201casymmetry\u201d) of a distribution. When we plot theoretical quantiles on the x-axis and the sample quantiles whose distribution we want to know on the y-axis then we see a very peculiar shape of a Normally distributed Q-Q plot for skewness. If the bottom end of the Q-Q plot deviates from the straight line but the upper end is not, then we can clearly say that the distribution has a longer tail to its left or simply it is left-skewed (or negatively skewed) but when we see the upper end of the Q-Q plot to deviate from the straight line and the lower and follows a straight line then the curve has a longer till to its right and it is right-skewed (or positively skewed).", "Similarly, we can talk about the Kurtosis (a measure of \u201cTailedness\u201d) of the distribution by simply looking at its Q-Q plot. The distribution with a fat tail will have both the ends of the Q-Q plot to deviate from the straight line and its center follows a straight line, whereas a thin-tailed distribution will form a Q-Q plot with a very less or negligible deviation at the ends thus making it a perfect fit for the Normal Distribution.", "Note that when the data points are pretty less the Q-Q plot does not perform very precisely and it fails to give a conclusive answer but when we have ample amount of data points and then we plot a Q-Q plot using a large data set then it gives us a significant result to conclude any result about the type of distribution.", "Here is a simple implementation of plotting a Q-Q plot in python.", "Another Implementation of the Q-Q plot using the Scipy library.", "I definitely recommend you go and check out the Wikipedia page of the Q-Q plot which has a very beautiful explanation about the complete concept of the mathematics working behind it which would be quite overwhelming in this introductory article. Also, check out the youtube video by Josh Starmer which demonstrates the concept in a good visualizing manner.", "and many more at Paras Varshney.", "I hope you learned something new from this read!", "Download the Jupyter Notebook of Q-Q plot implementation.", "I write blogs about Data Science and Machine Learning.
