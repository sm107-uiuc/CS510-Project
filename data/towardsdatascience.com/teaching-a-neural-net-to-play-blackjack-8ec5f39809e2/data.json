And through these simulations, we discovered the key drivers of the casino\u2019s advantage. Here is a quick recap of our previous findings:", "If you are unfamiliar with the game of blackjack, my previous post also describes how the game is played and the rules.", "The objective of today\u2019s post is whether we can use deep learning to arrive at a better strategy than the naive one. We will:", "If you are unfamiliar with neural nets, I wrote extensively about them in this post (it\u2019s the post I worked hardest on so please check it out).", "Before we jump into the training process, let\u2019s step back and quickly discuss what some of the pros and cons of using a neural net in this case are. Neural nets are highly flexible algorithms \u2014 like soft clay, a neural net adjusts itself to fit the contours of the data even with little to no transformation. Data that would trouble something more rigid like linear regression is easily handled by a neural net. Additionally, the layers and neurons within the network will learn any deeply embedded, non-linear relationships that may exist in the data.", "However, this versatility comes at a cost \u2014 the neural net is a black box model. Unlike regression where we can learn how the model makes decisions by looking at the regression coefficients, there is no such transparency with a neural net. Also, neural nets run the risk of fitting our data too well and then not generalizing well on out of sample data. In my opinion, these disadvantages are worth keeping in mind and designing safeguards for, but they are not reasons to shy away from using neural nets.", "Before we can train our neural net, we first need to figure out how to structure our training data so that the model we build with it will be useful.", "What do we want to predict? In my view, there are two candidates for our target variable:", "It actually took me a while to figure out the best way to set this up. But here is what I came up with.", "We need a way for the neural net to know whether a given move was correct or not. It doesn\u2019t need to be foolproof, it just needs to be generally correct. So my method of deciding whether a given move is the correct one is to simulate a game of blackjack: deal the cards to both player and dealer, check if anyone has a blackjack, make only one move (either hit or stay), simulate the game to its end and record the result. Since the simulated player only makes a single decision, we can assess the quality of that decision by whether he wins or loses the game:", "This allows us to train our model so that its output is a prediction of whether to hit or stay. The code is similar to last time\u2019s so I won\u2019t give a detailed overview here (you can also find it on my GitHub here). But the primary features are:", "And the target variable is the correct decision as defined by the logic above.", "We will be using the Keras library for our neural net. Let\u2019s first get our imports out of the way:", "Now let\u2019s set up our input variables for training the neural network. The variable feature_list is a list with the column names of the features (X variables) that I listed above. The dataframe model_df is where I store all the data from the blackjack simulations that I ran.", "The lines of code to actually instantiate and train our neural net are pretty simple. The first line (line 1) creates a sequential type neural net, which is a linear sequence of neural net layers. The lines after line 1 add layers to our model one by one (dense is the simplest layer type and is just a bunch of neurons) \u2014 the numbers like 16, 128, etc. specify the number of neurons in each layer.", "Finally for the last layer, we need to choose an activation function. This converts the raw output of the neural network into something interpretable by us. Pay attention to two things about the final layer. First, it includes only one neuron because we are predicting between two possible outcomes (two class problem). And second, we use a sigmoid activation because we want our neural net to act like logistic regression and predict whether the correct move is to hit (Y=1) or to stay (Y=0) \u2014 in other words, we want to know the probability that hitting is the correct move.", "The last two lines tell our neural net model what loss function to use (binary cross-entropy is a loss function used by classification models that output probabilities) and fits the model to our data. I didn\u2019t spend too much time tweaking the numbers of layers or neurons, but if someone were to play around with my code, I would suggest those as potential avenues for improvement.", "A quick way to eye-ball whether our model adds any value is to use a ROC Curve (check out the linked blog by yours truly if you would like a deep dive on ROC Curves). The ROC Curve tells us how good our model is at trading off between benefit (True Positive Rate) and cost (False Positive Rate) \u2014 the greater the area under the curve is, the better the model.", "The plot below shows the ROC Curve of our blackjack playing neural net \u2014 the neural net seems to be adding a fair bit of value over guessing randomly (the red dashed line). Its area under the curve, or AUC, of 0.73 is significantly higher than the AUC for random guessing (0.50).", "I used my training data to plot the ROC Curve. Usually we would want to plot it using our validation or test data, but in this case we know that as long as our sample is big enough, then it is representative of the population (assuming we keep playing blackjack with the same rules). And we would expect our model to generalize well (any new data would have the same underlying statistical characteristics as our training data).", "Before our neural net can officially start gambling, we need to give it a decision rule. Remember that the sigmoid activation (from our final neural net layer) makes our neural network output a probability that the correct move is to hit. We need a decision rule, where given this probability, we decide whether to hit or stay.", "I wrote the following function to do just that \u2014 the model_decision function takes in the features that the neural net requires, makes a prediction using those features, and compares that prediction to a predefined threshold in order to decide whether to hit or stay. I use 0.52 because we already know from last time that busting is the biggest risk to a blackjack player. Thus, using 0.52 as the cutoff for hitting makes our model slightly less likely to hit, and therefore slightly less likely to bust.", "Now we just need to add the above function to our code where we decide whether or not to hit (please refer to my GitHub if you are curious how I coded this part). So when it comes time to decide what to do, the neural net will make its decision based on the card that the dealer is showing, the total hand value of its own cards, and whether or not it is holding an ace.", "Finally, let\u2019s compare our neural net\u2019s performance with both the naive strategy and the random one. To remind everyone:", "Let\u2019s see if our neural net was able to find a better strategy. The following table shows the outcome distribution for each strategy type. Two things jump out to me. First, our neural net only lost slightly less than half (49%) the games it played. While I wouldn\u2019t call that beating the house, it\u2019s pretty decent for a game where the odds are fixed against you. Second, it actually doesn\u2019t win more often than the naive strategy \u2014 rather it is able to force more ties.", "We can also take a look at how the strategies perform across our key features (dealer card and player hand total). First, let\u2019s check out the impact of the dealer\u2019s shown card on the probability of winning or tying for our three strategies. In the plot below, if the dealer is showing a low card, our neural network performs about as well as the naive strategy. But when the dealer is showing a higher card (7 or more), our neural net performs significantly better.", "We can take a look at how the probability of winning or tying varies with the player\u2019s initial hand total as well. This looks pretty promising \u2014 our neural net performs as well or better across the board. And unlike the naive strategy, which performs even worse than random guessing in The Valley of Despair (player hand values between 12 and 16), our neural network performs better.", "The most recent plot hints at how the neural net is able to surpass the naive strategy. The naive strategy (because of how we coded it) is unwilling to take a chance any time that there is even a remote risk of busting. The neural net, on the other hand regularly hits on 12s, 13s, 14s, or 15s. It\u2019s more nuanced decision making and ability to take on calculated risks seems to set it apart from the naive strategy.", "We can take a look at what the neural net does when the player\u2019s hand totals to be between 12 and 16 to try to improve our naive strategy (and not lose as much money to the casino).", "It looks like there is a strong preference to hit when the dealer is showing a high card (8, 9, or 10). But even when the dealer is showing a low card like 3, the neural net still chooses to hit 60% of the time \u2014 this is because the neural net is taking into account all the features that it has at its disposal when making a decision. So it looks like we can\u2019t easily distill its decisions into a few simple rules of thumb.", "Hopefully this post gave you a decent introduction of how machine learning can be used aid real-life decision making. Here are a few things to keep in mind when you are training your own models (whether they be decisions trees, regressions, or neural nets):", "Finally a last word on blackjack. I probably won\u2019t write about gambling again for a while (there are too many other topics I would like to explore). But if someone were interested in moving forward with or without my code, here are a few potentially interesting extensions to this project:", "Hope you found this as interesting as I did.
