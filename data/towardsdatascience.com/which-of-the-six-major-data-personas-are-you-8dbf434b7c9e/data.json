The modern data organization has something similar, and it\u2019s called the \u201cBad Data Blame Game.\u201d Unlike the name game, however, the Bad Data Blame Game is played when data downtime strikes and no amount of rhyming and dancing can save the day.", "Data downtime refers to periods of time when your data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate, and nine times out of ten, you have no idea what caused it. All you know is that it\u2019s 3 a.m., your CEO is pissed, your dashboards are wrong, and you need to fix it \u2014 stat.", "After speaking to over 200 data teams, we\u2019ve identified the major data personas involved in the Bad Data Blame Game. Maybe you recognize one or two?", "In this article, we\u2019ll introduce these roles, zero in on their hopes, dreams, and fears, and share our approach to conquering data reliability at your company.", "This is Ophelia, your Chief Data Officer (CDO). Although she\u2019s probably not (wo)manning your company\u2019s data pipelines or Looker dashboards, Ophelia\u2019s impact is hitched to the consistency, accuracy, relevance, interpretability, and reliability of the data her team provides.", "Ophelia wakes up every day and asks herself two things. First, are different departments getting the data they need to be effective? And second, are we managing risk around that data effectively?", "She would sleep much easier with a clear, bird\u2019s-eye view showing that her data ecosystem is operating as it should. At the end of the day, if bad data gets in front of the CEO, out to the public, or to any other data consumer, she\u2019s on the line.", "Betty, the business intelligence lead or data analyst, wants a punchy and insightful dashboard she can share with her stakeholders in marketing, sales, and operations to answer their multifarious questions about how their business functions are performing. When things go wrong at the practitioner-level, Betty is the first one paged.", "To ensure reliable data, she needs to answer these questions:", "Null values and duplicated entries are Betty\u2019s arch-nemeses and she\u2019s a fan of anything that can prevent data downtime from compromising her peace of mind. She\u2019s fatigued by business stakeholders that ask her to investigate a funny value in a report \u2014 it\u2019s a long process to chase the data upstream and validate if it\u2019s right!", "Sam, the data scientist, studied Forestry in undergrad, but decided to make the jump to industry to pay off his student loans. Somewhere between a line of Python code and a data visualization, he fell in love with data science. And the rest was history.", "To do his job well, Sam needs to know 1) where the data comes from and 2) that it\u2019s reliable, because if it\u2019s not, his team\u2019s A/B tests won\u2019t work and all downstream consumers (analysts, managers, executives, and customers) will suffer.", "Sam\u2019s team spends roughly 80 percent of their time scrubbing, cleaning, and understanding the context of the data, so they need tools and solutions that can make their lives easier.", "Proud owner of a seven-month old puppy, Gerald is the company\u2019s very first data governance specialist. He started off on the legal team, and then, when GDPR and CCPA entered the picture, eventually focused his efforts exclusively on data compliance. It\u2019s a novel role, but becoming increasingly important as the organization grows.", "When it comes to data reliability, Gerald cares about 1) unified definitions of data and metrics across the company and 2) understanding who has access and visibility to what data.", "For Gerald, bad data can mean costly fines, erosion of customer trust, and lawsuits. Despite the criticality of his role, he sometimes jests that it\u2019s like accounting: \u201cyou\u2019re only front and center if something has gone wrong!\u201d", "When it comes to data reliability, Emerson, the data engineer, is at the crux of the equation.", "Emerson started out as a full-stack developer at a small e-commerce startup, but then as the company grew, so too did their data needs. Before she knew it, she was responsible not just for building their data product but also integrating the data sources the team relies on to make decisions about the business. Now, she\u2019s a Snowflake expert, PowerBI guru, and general data tooling whiz.", "Emerson and her team are the glue that hold the company\u2019s data ecosystem together. They implement technologies that monitor the reliability of their company\u2019s data, and if something goes awry, she\u2019s the one whose paged by the analytics team at 3 a.m. to fix it. Like Betty, she\u2019s lost countless hours of sleep because of this.", "To be successful at her job, Emerson must tackle a lot of things, including:", "This is Peter. He\u2019s a data product manager. Peter got his start as a back-end developer, but made the jump to product management a few years ago. Like Gerald, he\u2019s the company\u2019s first-ever hire in this role, which is simultaneously exciting and challenging.", "He\u2019s up to date on all the latest data engineering and data analytics solutions, and is often called upon to make decisions on what offerings his organization needs to invest in to be successful. He knows firsthand how automation and self-serve tooling make all the difference when it comes to delivering an accessible, scalable data product.", "All other data stakeholders, from analysts to social media managers, are dependent on him for building a platform that ingests, unifies, and makes accessible data from a myriad of sources to consumers all over the business. Oh, and did we mention that this data must be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other industry regulations? It\u2019s a challenging role and it\u2019s difficult to keep everyone happy \u2014 it seems like his platform is always one transformation away from what BI actually wanted.", "So, who in your data organization owns the reliability piece of your data ecosystem?", "As you can imagine, the answer isn\u2019t simple. From your company\u2019s CDO to your data engineers, it\u2019s ultimately everyone\u2019s responsibility to ensure data reliability. And although nearly every arm of every organization at every company relies on data, not every data team has the same structure, and various industries have different requirements. (For instance, it\u2019s the norm for financial institutions to hire entire teams of data governance experts, but at a small startup, not so much. And for those startups that do \u2014 we commend you!)", "Below, we outline our approach to mapping data responsibilities, from accessibility to reliability, across your data organization using the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) matrix guidelines:", "At companies that ingest and transform terabytes of data (like Netflix or Uber), we\u2019ve found that it is common for data engineers and data product managers to tackle the responsibility of monitoring and alerting for data reliability issues.", "Barring these behemoths, the responsibility often falls on data engineers and product managers. They must balance the organization\u2019s demand for data with what can be provided reliably. Notably, the brunt of any bad choices made here is often borne by the BI analysts, whose dashboards may wind up containing bad information or break from silent changes. In very early data organizations, these roles are often combined into a jack-of-all-trades data person or a product manager.", "Regardless of your team\u2019s situation, you\u2019re not alone.", "Fortunately, there\u2019s a better way to start trusting your data: data observability. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s taking off with most innovative companies, no matter who is ultimately responsible for ensuring data reliability in your organization.", "In fact, with the right data reliability strategy, the Bad Data Blame Game is a thing of the past and full end-to-end observability is in sight.", "Interested in learning more?
