This is the second part of the new Django series I have started writing on, which is Building a Job Search Portal with Django. I hope every one of you has already read the first part.", "If you have not yet read the first part of this series, I would strongly recommend reading the first part first and then coming back to this one. Here I am linking the first part:-", "So, in this part of the series, we will be discussing the Users app and will also overwrite some pre-defined templates present in allauth, which we are using for social login in our app.", "So, we will first start with the Users app backend part (models, views, forms etc.) and then move on to the part of the templates.", "Users app has nothing to do with any models and forms since we only use this app for all authentication, profile and account purposes. All our major backend is stored in the candidates and recruiters app. Here, in the Users app, we only have some views to deal with, which are needed to show the relevant templates.", "You may be wondering why so less work is needed for authentication purposes. Actually, a lot is happening, but we do not need to care about them. All of this can be attributed to the fact that we are using the allauth package to handle our authentication, and we are not doing this on our own.", "Also, we are only using social login providers, so we are free from any password handling and recovery issues. So, we do not need to bother with this part.", "So, let\u2019s have a look at views.py of the Users app.", "So, as you can see, we have two imports and two functions in this part. The imports are regular Django terms which are used for rendering a template and making a page accessible only when logged in, respectively.", "Now let\u2019s see the two functions one by one:-", "If the user tries to access the accounts page when he is not logged in, it redirects the user to the login page, and once the user logs in, then it takes them to the account page.", "Now, let\u2019s move to the templates part of the Users app. So, we will see four templates in this section \u2014 login, logout, account and layout.", "So, in this login file, we will first extend the layout (which we will create soon).", "So, it will have three social login providers. We are here using a Card based layout in which we display all three social providers. So, let\u2019s have a look at the login.html code.", "So, as you see, we have added the three social providers one by one. So, let\u2019s have a look at how it looks.", "This is the page which shows up when a user logs out. It is a very simple page and shows the user that they have logged out and also shows a button to log in again.", "Here\u2019s a look at the code of the logout page:-", "Now let\u2019s have a look at how this logout page looks.", "This page will show all the relevant details like username and email and will allow you to link your social accounts.", "Linking social accounts helps you to log in with a different social login provider than the one with which you first logged in. So, if you used Google for the first time and you want to use LinkedIn or Github, too, you can connect these.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the code:-", "Here is how it looks in the browser:-", "This is the layout of the entire website which each other webpage extends from. It contains the header and footer of the website.", "It links this template to all the CSS and JS files we will use. We are not using any JS scripts since we are focusing on the Django part rather than frontend. So, we have used Bootstrap4 CSS and JS files and a pair of other CSS files.", "We have two sections for the navigation bar, one for the recruiter side and the other for the candidate side and also have a button to move to the other side.", "The default opening is on the candidate side, though. It also has the login button when we are not signed in, and when we log in, the login button disappears, and the logout button appears.", "The navigation bar also signifies what page is currently active to let the user know where they are.", "The footer is the same everywhere, with some links to pages and some details about the website and links to some social media handles.", "So let\u2019s have a look at the layout file here:-", "Now, we have covered all four templates of the Users section. We now move on to the section where we need to overwrite a few templates which come built-in with allauth. Those do not pretty, and we need to overwrite them to match those pages with the same feel as our website\u2019s.", "So, to overwrite the pages related to the social login providers, we need to create a folder named templates/socialaccount.", "In that folder, we have four templates which we want to overwrite. Let\u2019s look at them one by one:-", "This page displays that some authentication error has occurred, and we need to log in again. So, it displays a button for the login page.", "It just displays the social account linking/connection was successful and shows a button to go back to the accounts page.", "This page shows that the login process was cancelled, and the user needs to log in again.", "This page is shown when a user tries to log in via a different social provider than the one they used before. So, this page tells them first to connect those accounts and then they can use other providers to log in.", "So, this is all for this article. Hopefully, you enjoyed reading this article. The next parts of this tutorial series are:-", "If you want to learn about Django Rest Framework, there is a new and exciting series I am working on, which you can have a look on:", "Also, you can check out the five-part Social Media Website with Django series, which was quite well received. It is a different project based on Django, and you will surely love it.", "Your home for data science.
