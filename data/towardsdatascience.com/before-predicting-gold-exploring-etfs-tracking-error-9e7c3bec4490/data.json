This is comparable to doing a financial model where a novice Quant rushes to the modeling process without spending sufficient time exploring the intricate details of the data\u201d.", "In this article, I will share my personal experience in doing a research project for Global Precious Metals. My firm is a niche player in the precious metals market, offering global end-to-end service from sales and trading to storing and delivering precious metals to prospective clients. Their goal was to \u2018bring some quantitative practice to old school physical work\u2019. I was to take part in this revolution and help the firm realize a systematic way to allocate money to gold. The firm might not be familiar with deriving the mathematical cost function of a regression model, but they know the mechanics of the gold industry. I was always astonished by the heavy flow of information and findings revolving this polarized asset, which kindled my exploration from the very first day.", "I told myself \u201cforget about modeling, it\u2019s time to learn about gold\u201d.", "There is a plethora of benefits and caveats of using gold ETF as an alternative to gold spot prices for modeling. I will also allude to the notion of fund tracking errors and underlying factors that the deviations. Tracking error exists in every fund that tracks a benchmark. Because it exists, one has to question whether or not the gold ETF would represent the genuine value of gold. It introduces caution to not only gold modelers but also investors. This article will not go through the deep mechanism of tracking errors, but it will guide you through my resolve to it.", "The article will address the following considerations before developing a model for gold:", "So we want to create an investment model for gold. The first question is which gold asset do we model with. Some of the asset choices are:", "Assume your objective is to invest and actually store the gold. Allocation to gold will be re-balanced weekly. We decided to use an ML model to predict the direction of one week returns using daily observations.", "Using futures prices are out of the question because we are not hedging nor speculating on the futures price. We can base the model on the LBMA spot price, but this method conveys some issues when constructing our feature set.", "The Data-Time Alignment Problem \u2014 LBMA sets the gold price in an auction twice per day (at 10:30 and 15:00 London BST on weekdays). Therefore, data is only available daily with AM and PM prices. Consider these scenarios:", "Solution \u2014 This is where gold ETFs comes in. Because many of our features are U.S. based (the majority of models are this way), it is sensible to use the gold ETF that\u2019s trading on a U.S. exchange as the target variable. Unlike using the LBMA spot price, the time zones are now synced and the data alignment process becomes easier. You may have to use some intraday data, but you cut down a large amount of unnecessary work. Also, the investment portfolio can now be scaled by also using the price of a silver ETF as a proxy for spot silver. Aligning gold ETF price and silver ETF price is done effortlessly by using corresponding close prices.", "However, using an ETF\u2019s price as a proxy will present some backtest slippage compared to using a spot price due to ETF\u2019s tracking error. Every ETF that attempts to track an index/asset would have a tracking error. The good news is we can select a gold ETF that exhibits a tolerable tracking error.", "To summarize, we are trading off minimal slippage for proper and clean data.", "For the subsequent analysis, we will be needing the LBMA Gold Fix and ETFs data. We know that these time series are in different time zones. For adaptability, we will be normalizing all time series to UTC which eliminates day light saving nuances.", "We import pytz and define timezone instances:", "We download LBMA Gold fix CSV data from Quandl and import it through Pandas. Data is from 1968\u201301\u201302. By using PM fix time, we can ensure that the corresponding ETF price is during market hours (15:00 London time is equivalent to 10:00 EST time).", "Methods to deal with NaN values will be shown later.", "Next, we will be fetching the following ETFs data for our analysis:", "These ETFs trade on the NYSEARCA exchange and track the gold bullion which makes them candidates for gauging their performance. We will be using minute data from firstratedata.com, a reliable intraday data provider for various assets. Data is downloaded in multiple text files per ticker and are separated by date ranges. We convert EST to UTC timezone as well.", "Tracking error is derived from tracking difference. According to etf.com, the definition of tracking difference is \u2018the discrepancy between the ETF\u2019s performance and index\u2019s performance. Tracking error is the annualized standard deviation of tracking differences between the total return performance of the fund and the total return performance of its underlying index.\u2019 From daily returns data, the corresponding tracking difference of a daily observation can be computed by finding the difference between the index return and ETF return. From there, we can compute annualized standard deviation of daily tracking differences.", "We now align LBMA gold PM fix with GLD. We remove any NaN rows instead of using front filling since we want our calculation to be as realistic as possible.", "Below is the function for computing tracking error and creating a new DataFrame with tracking difference:", "There are occasional T.D. spikes in the time series and in the PDF plot. In theory they represent outliers, but in reality they reflect empirical under performance from GLD.", "In the next section, we will investigate causation between T.E. and proposed factors.", "The following are some potential factors that might affect a commodity tracking fund\u2019s T.E.:", "Every fund has an expense ratio fee. It is the annual fee that is charged towards investors for management and operating costs. Potentially the greater the fee, the greater the gap that exists in a fund\u2019s performance in tracking an index. Let\u2019s compare expense ratio and T.E. between GLD and IAU. GLD\u2019s expense ratio is known to be higher than IAU\u2019s. Additionally, we are going to recalculate our T.E. using only data from 2017, since it will depict a more realistic relation with the current expense ratio.", "*Expense ratios are taken from ETF.com*", "Results reveal that there exists a positive relation between T.E. and expense ratio. IAU\u2019s T.E. has always been relatively lower than GLD\u2019s, regarding GLD\u2019s higher expense ratio.", "The assumption is that when there are significant price swings, it will be harder for funds to track the movement of gold, thus creating discrepancies between returns. Let\u2019s exploit this with GLD.", "We will be needing GLD\u2019s daily data from Finnhub.io to calculate rolling volatilty using Wilder\u2019s ATR. Finnhub offers a free api that allows us to fetch daily data of stocks/ETFs since inception.", "We define ATR functions and a DataFrame function to create a new DataFrame to merge our existing T.D. dataframe with the DataFrame containing daily rolling ATR. A lookback of 20 days is used for defining volatility, equivalent to 1 month span.", "The plots illustrate affects of ETF\u2019s price volatility on T.D. When there is a sudden volatility spike, the T.D. will also spike subsequently. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a bear decline in gold price causes the T.D. to rise as well. These are evidences of causation between volatility and ETF under performance.", "Many commodity ETFs track the price of a commodity through the futures market. The fund would sell the nearby contract before the delivery date in order to \u2018roll\u2019 into buying the next nearby contract. Because of the contango nature of gold futures, rolling into a higher futures price would earn a loss for the ETF even if the spot price remains slightly the same. We are not certain if this mechanism exists in GLD, nor the time when the fund rolls the contract. The following analysis tests our hypothesis.", "A gold futures contract has the first delivery date on the first trading day of every month. Therefore, the assumption is GLD will roll its contract during the last 10 days of each month, considering some of days are not trading days. We seperate our Dataframe into 3 day ranges: 1st to 10th, 11th to 20th, and 21st to 31th of every month. Then we calculate the T.E. for each dataframe. For confidence of our analysis, we iterate through each year, calculate each year\u2019s T.E. and taking the mean of yearly values. Provided, our data should represent the population.", "Our results demonstrate that as date ranges closes to the end of month, the T.E. increases. Although the values does not accurately deduce that the rise in T.E. is due to futures roll settlements, but it suggests there are some trading/reblancing activity that causes the under performance of funds. At the very least, we are ensured that GLD exhibits tracking difficulties near end-of-month. This opens up future research opportunities for potential end-of-month activites regarding rise in T.E..", "We will now select our candidate ETF. The ETF\u2019s price will be chosen to be our target variable for prospective ML models.", "The method is to calculate the sensitivity of each ETF\u2019s returns vs spot returns. This sensitivity is known as linear coeficient Beta. Another metric to observe is R-Squared, the statistical measure to gauge the correlation of price movement between ETF and gold. The closer to 1, the better the fund performance.", "We run a linear regression on each ETF DataFrame, observe R-Squared and Beta, and visualize a scatter plot with a linear fit.", "IAU has slightly higher scores than GLD. Basing our criteria on correlation alone, the scores are so proximate to each other that we can use either GLD or IAU. However, IAU\u2019s tracking error is lower than GLD which reflects on IAU\u2019s better long term performance. Additionally, IAU\u2019s expense ratio is lower than GLD so we can expect lower return deviations in the long run. Therefore, this suggests that IAU maybe a better candidate for the model.", "We have walked through the process in building prior knowledge to modelling gold. The process is focused on analyzing your gold data and researching the little details on tracking error that adds context to model building process. We analyzed underlying factors of fund tracking error and proposed a method to choose a gold ETF target variable. The key take here is that exploring your data is as important as building high performance ML models.", "Your home for data science.
