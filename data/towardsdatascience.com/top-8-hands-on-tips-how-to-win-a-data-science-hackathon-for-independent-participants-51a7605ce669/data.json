Modern industrial companies and famous consulting agencies talk everywhere about digital transformation. The numbers of necessary IT staff shows grow year-to-year, companies around the world feel the lack of capabilities and in rush try to fill their gaps in IT departments. To find the rock stars or bright beginners they provide enormous events such as technological meetups, conferences, hackathons, etc.", "Last year was no exception. It was saturated with various hackathons for IT-oriented specialists, especially for those who are involved in the data science area. Before the start I wrote a short explanation about goals and the mechanics of hackathons for those who are unfamiliar with it.", "The \u00abhackathon\u00bb \u2014 a portmanteau word of the \u00abhack\u00bb and \u00abmarathon\u00bb where \u00abhack\u00bb refers to computer science area and \u00abmarathon\u00bb tells you that it is a long-time event.", "Roughly speaking it is a competition for IT specialists where the main goal is to solve the business problem by building a prototype. Nobody expects to find a highly optimized code in your final solution for instance like in competitive programming. In hackathons it is important to show the minimal viable product (MVP) that is well fitted to satisfy end-users needs. Often the hackathon organizers are huge corporations that pursue to find a fresh solution for their problems and talented specialists for hire. It\u2019s difficult to call to mind at least one hackathon without HR guys. Usually, they are super friendly, want to chat and willing to invite for an interview in case of your victory. If you want to know something about their company or open vacancies don\u2019t be afraid to ask them.", "Traditionally, hackathons are carried out in an organizer\u2019s office or rented places such as hotel conference rooms or co-working spaces. For those enthusiasts who made up their mind to dedicate all weekend to insane coding and investigation of real business problems, there are a lot of motivators prepared.", "Beginners can observe their productive network with community, challenge themselves in hands-on tasks with real data (not in refined Kaggle data) and improve their teamwork skills. Middle level engineers and analysts can be invited for an interview or grab good money in case of victory.", "Hackathons attract teams that have experience in team-working and also individual specialists who are willing to join teams with organizers support. This is the article for those who don\u2019t have a team but want to challenge themselves. Bellow, you can find 8 hands-on tips which are defined and based on my last hackathon. I participated as an individual and following those tips, my team managed to win, but take into account that one size doesn\u2019t fit for all.", "Before introducing those, let me give you a context about the hackathon and tasks. The sponsor of the hackathon was an international oil refinery company Sibur. The competition was mostly focused on data science area and looked for IT specialists, such as data science, projects managers, backend and frontend developers. Teams were able to choose one of two problems: develop a solution to optimize distribution of hotel vouchers or build a predictive model that predicts coking of carbonized catalyst into the reactor. In both cases, the final solution should consist of 2 main parts: an algorithm based on data analysis and a user-friendly interface that should show how the analytical model works. To build the prototypes the real historical data (anonymized in the first case) was given to the teams.Also, participants could interview users and subject matter experts. Datasets were presented in untreated CSV files, hand-processed .xlsx files and required rigorous preprocessing. Detailed hackathon description can be found here and the list of winners here, however, the information is represented only in Russian.", "So, now that you are familiar with the context let\u2019s look at bits of advice that helped us reach the goal.", "Once the team is made, organize an offline meeting or telephone conference for all participants, just to introduce themselves. During the meeting ask your teammates about their expectations and make sure you have the same goals. Someone might have ambitions to win but someone may be happy just to participate. When you are confident in the team\u2019s expectations, move further; talk about skills and experience. That warm-up makes teamwork much more productive and helps smooth obstacles that usually arise in new groups. Our team was made of participants coming from different cities and we were not able to meet beforehand, so the first meeting was via Skype. During the call each of us talked a little about ourselves, our expectations and our background.", "Don\u2019t rush, before applying for a task, figure out what your team is good at; what the gaps are and how to distribute project roles. Meet again to define where your strengths and weaknesses are and how to appoint the roles. Make a decision on which team-member will play a project manager role and will be able to manage the team\u2019s coherence. The hackathon project manager is one of the most important men in the team because he/she combines team leader\u2019s responsibilities and manages high-speed development. He/she is responsible for the deep understanding of the project\u2019s timeline, team synch-ups and resolution of the conflicts. After a couple of days after the first call, we met again. The second call was much more productive because team-mates already knew each other. That helped us choose most suitable task for our team, also we could get to know each other better.", "Usually organizers give several tasks to choose from. Take the one in which every teammate will be able to show their best sides. The competitive load should be distributed evenly among all participants, otherwise your team will not be able to complete the task in time. Contribution of each team member is highly important. The fittest task will be defined depending on what set of skills your team has. In this way, the workload is distributed evenly without being skewed towards one or two people. In my case, we made a conscious decision in favor of distribution of hotel vouchers, despite the fact that time-series prediction was much more interesting to data scientists. If we would have chosen the second one, the workload would have skewed to the side of data scientists and the whole team would not be involved. With limited time we had, that would negatively affect the team\u2019s outcome.", "It doesn\u2019t always happen that the winning criteria is defined by the highest score. Frequently, organizers give you space for improvisation without clearly defining numeric indicators (similar to real business case). In this case, try to figure out who your stakeholders are, who the users are and what is important to them. Perhaps, users expect the highest accuracy rate of your model, but maybe they would be excited to meet user-friendly interface and some strongly exciting features. Try to talk to them and ask these questions. You only have 2 days to understand the business problem and show your solution. So, better be focused on a limited number of features.", "Hackathon is a project where the result should be a minimal viable product. As in any project, each participant of the team should clearly understand the steps of the project and their contribution. Furthermore, your team should work as synchronized as possible. Most likely, you will face unequal experience of the teammates and speed of their work. Along with that, you will probably not have a well-adjusted communication process. In our case, we were doing 2 hourly sprints to make it work. Each sprint had a clearly defined scope, and after every 2 hours, we had a status check and fixed the open questions.", "Suppose you already met your team, approximately understand stakeholders and users expectation, and you already formed the vision of your prototype that will definitely lead to victory. In spite of the good start, I recommend you to show your progress to stakeholders and users. When making a demo, don\u2019t lose your time, validate the hypothesis and ask for feedback. It is no surprise that the front-end part is particularly affected by users\u2019 opinions. Also, be curious and attentive, try to figure out the hidden needs, as this could be your joker. In our case, the first version of the prototype and the final product had opposite business values. After several short demos with users, we changed not only the design, but also the business logic. We tried showing the prototype after every sprint and validate hypotheses during demonstrations.", "Make sure all members of the team are familiar with git. Set up backups and deploy a virtual environment one day earlier. Sharing files via email makes teamwork unbearable.", "Take into account that hackathon is not competitive programming where you aspire to write universal and high performance codes. Here you are literally selling your product during the demo part. Most likely you will have 5\u201310 minutes for the presentation of how your MVP works and meets the business needs. Define who in your team performs better when speaking publicly and can distinctly answer the users and subject matter experts questions. Take it seriously, rehearse at least 3 times. Dedicate 3 hours to rehearse the demo speech with the team. Also, brainstorm on any possible questions. Prepare the answers.", "One more advice instead of conclusion:", "Think beyond the task \u2014 try to figure out why this problem exists, perhaps the problem is in the process and it is not necessary to resolve it technologically. Our final solution was consisted of not only a ready to use prototype but also suggestions for improving the business process. Those also helped reach the goal.", "Hackathon is not only about possibilities of finding an interesting job. It is also about creating opportunities for beginners to challenge themselves through working with real data, as well as meeting the community and experts. Don\u2019t be afraid to participate without a team. It doesn\u2019t matter if you win or not. You will get real experience that you can put in your CV and that will be noticed by HR. If you have already participated in hackathons and you are willing to give advice, please share it.", "Your home for data science.
