These datasets include temperature, precipitation and more. NASA hosts this data on a website where you can search and grab information as needed, whether you want the data for the whole world or a specific area. The user can choose a certain range of dates, look for aggregate time frames (hours, days, months etc.). The possibilities are limitless.", "In this article, let\u2019s explore this huge resource and I\u2019ll describe a step-by-step process to collect data from the website.", "GES DISC stands for NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC). It is a data repository that hosts remote sensing data about precipitation, hydrology, atmosphere and more. It was designed to enable researchers and application developers to get access to NASA data, which they can then use to do analysis and create applications.", "Let\u2019s walk through the steps for retrieving data from GES DISC. In this particular article, I\u2019ll walk through the steps for downloading precipitation data and for that, I\u2019ll download the GPM monthly data. GPM stands for Global Precipitation Measurement, a joint venture between JAXA and NASA to capture precipitation data across the globe.", "The data repository is located here. Before you download data, you need to create an account on the earthdata website. Simply create an account on this website, verify yourself and you should be good to go.", "Select the Login button on the top right. If you have an account, log in else select the Register button to get registered.", "Once we are logged in, we can get started. The website greets you with a search box with Data Collections selected by default. We are looking for data in this collection itself, so we will let it be and start typing in the search box.", "Here, I\u2019ll type precipitation in the search box and press the yellow search button to get the available datasets. You\u2019ll notice a loading icon indicating that the system is processing our search query and will return a list of datasets that match the search query.", "Once the search completes, you will see a table of various datasets that match the query and a filters section on the left. The table includes information such as image, dataset name, sources, spatial radius, start of data collection date and end of data collection date. Based on your specific requirements, you can use the filters on the left and select conditions that help you get the most precise data.", "In this example, I\u2019m looking for GPM monthly data. So, in the filters, under Project, I selected GPM. This filtered the datasets that belong to GPM. From the Time Res. column, I looked for the dataset which had 1 month resolution. This means that data is aggregated on a monthly basis.", "From the list, it\u2019s the third dataset called GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 month 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGM 06). To explore more about this dataset, I simply click on its name (which is a hyperlink) and it takes me to the dataset page.", "The page has detailed information about the dataset along with an image. This is followed by the summary of the dataset (referred to as Product). The most essential parts are the buttons we see on the right side of the screen. You can explore the various services and more but we are interested in the link Subset / Get Data. This is the step where we get started with downloading the data. Click on this link.", "On clicking the link, a popup shows up as seen in the image below.", "The dataset we get is pretty huge because it captures information for the whole globe across several years. A good idea is to select a certain range of dates that you\u2019re looking for and certain area of the globe.", "In the example here, I\u2019ll capture all the original files, which means all the variables they have. I\u2019ll refine the range from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2020. Lastly, based on your selection above, you might see certain options for the Output format. As I am selecting original files, I only see HDF5.", "I\u2019ve worked with HDF5 file format and there is a very simple package h5py which enables you to read these files directly into python. But to just view these files, a popular software, HDFView is often used.", "Next, press the button Get Data and it\u2019ll start running to generate a number of links that will allow you to download the data.", "The popup shows a list of links, each corresponding to one data file based on the selection. There are two ways to download data from here.", "Click on the link of the data file you want to download. If you\u2019re logged in, the dataset will start downloading. It is fast, simple and requires no extra steps for downloading data.", "However, if you are downloading multiple files (say 30\u201340 files), this is not the most efficient way. Using curl, you can download all the files using just one single command.", "curl is a command line tool for transferring data using various network protocols.", "However, to use curl to download these data files, we need to perform some steps for the first time. The complete instructions vary by operating system and are available here.", "Here\u2019s a general overview of the steps in the most easy way to understand terms (as followed on MacOS):", "Above the list of links, you\u2019ll see a link called Download links list. When you click on it, a new tab opens up with all the links in one place. Select and copy all the text and save it to a file called url.txt on your machine.", "In the terminal, perform the following:", "wget is also another option but I haven\u2019t used it as curl performs well and I didn\u2019t feel the need to try wget.", "Once the HDF5 files are downloaded, you can use HDFView to open these files and look at the dataset. You will need an account to download this software.", "The data can be downloaded in other formats as well such as netCDF, ASCII etc. and there are ways to work with these files too but I haven\u2019t worked with them personally.", "You now have a set of data files containing resourceful data collected by NASA over the years, which you can use for your own work. In an upcoming article, I will describe the steps to read a HDF5 file in Python and understand its components to use the data.", "Hope this was insightful.
