I\u2019ll wait\u2026", "Ok, fair enough. Food, culture, and surreal cities are also valid choices. But my point still stands. 7-Eleven is, in my opinion, a staple of the lifestyle of certain Asian countries. There, you can find (almost) anything you need. Did you just land and need a SIM card? Go to 7\u201311. Do you need water because security made you empty your bottle? Go to 7\u201311. Hungry and want a cheap (and tasty) breakfast? You already know.", "During my traveling adventures in this beautiful continent, I\u2019ve quite often found solace (and snacks) in this convenience store. In fact, I\u2019ve been so many times there that I have enough data to study, and since I don\u2019t like wasting data, well, I analyzed it.", "In this article, I\u2019ll show what I discovered after investigating my 7-Eleven check-in data collected during my time in Asia. My analysis consists of two sections: which, when. In which, the goal is to discover which 7-Eleven\u2019s I visited and how many times. In this part, I\u2019ll summarize the dataset and explore it with a series of visualizations, while trying to answer the question, \u201cwhich 7\u201311 have I visited?\u201d", "Then comes the when part. In this segment, the objective is finding the trend or pattern of my visits (if there\u2019s any!). To find this out, I\u2019ll use hierarchical clustering, anomaly detection, and time series.", "This project\u2019s dataset consists of 99 check-ins I logged using the Foursquare\u2019s Swarm app during the period of July 7, 2019, to December 15, 2019. I collected the data in the following countries: Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Japan.", "The experiment uses R and Python code. The primary analysis \u2014 visualizations, clustering, and data exploration \u2014 is done in R. With Python, I used the library foursquare, Prophet to perform the time series analysis, and scikit-learn to do the anomaly detection.", "Every data project starts with data \u2014 the new electricity (catchy phrase, I know). So, my first step was collecting it. To do this, I wrote a small Python script that retrieves my Swarm check-in data and stores it in a JSON file. The following code shows how:", "Here, I\u2019m getting all my check-ins created between two dates. Since each API call retrieves a max of 250 check-ins, in each iteration, I had to increase the offset variable by 250 to get the subsequent 250.", "From July 7 to December 15, 2019 (162 days), I had the pleasure of visiting the store 99 times on 78 different days. That\u2019s 48% of the days \u2014 almost one visit every two days! However, and here comes the first pitfall of the analysis, I have to keep in mind that not every country I was at had 7-Elevens. For example, Cambodia has none. As a result, I need to remove those cases from my count. With that done, the total amount of days spent in countries with 7-Elevens reduces to 127, increasing the percentage to 61% \u2014 a bit more than once every two days. Figure 1 below presents the calendar. The days coded in red are those where I didn\u2019t visit the shop, while those in blue are the days where I did visit.", "The calendar tells us that there\u2019re a lot of visits, especially during August. I mean, look at that! On the other hand, most of October and early November are pretty empty because I was in Indonesia, a country with no 7\u201311s.", "But what about the days of the week? Do I have any preferred day? Well, there\u2019s an apparent inclination towards Sundays, the de facto lazy day of the week. Contrarily, on Mondays I probably said \u201cok, not today; you went yesterday,\u201d making this the day with fewer visits.", "Now let\u2019s see some actual numbers. The following chart introduces the number of check-ins per country. It shows that most of the visits were registered during my time in Thailand (32) and Malaysia (29), a fact I expected since I spent a considerable amount of time in those countries.", "Nonetheless, this raw number doesn\u2019t say much about the actual visits behavior. To add extra weight to them, I computed the percentage when compared against the rest of the check-ins. These are the results:", "Leading the list with 31% percent, is Thailand, meaning that every third check-in I did there was from a 7\u201311.", "Another way to further assess these visits is by mapping them. In the following visualizations, I\u2019m presenting various maps pinpointing the exact locations and the visit frequencies.", "From the maps, there\u2019s another piece of information we can deduct, and that\u2019s the areas where I spent most of my time. For instance, in Tokyo, I typically hang around the flashy lights and neon vibes of Shinjuku, while in Singapore, I found my inner peace among the city\u2019s skyscrapers.", "To produce the maps, I used R\u2019s package ggmap. Below is the code that created the Singapore map:", "While hard to distinguish, the maps also give an impression of the unique 7\u201311 stores I explored. For instance, in Kuala Lumpur, I frequented the same three. But counting them one by one is not an ideal nor scalable method, so to ease the process, I grouped all the unique 7\u201311s by country:", "To end this section, I want to show a histogram that summarizes the visits per store. The chart \u2014 shown below \u2014 reveals that I mostly visited each location only once. Precisely speaking, the median of the distribution is 1, while the mean is 2.32. However, don\u2019t trust the mean that much because that \u201c11\u201d value (a fitting number) at the farther end of the distribution shifts it a little.", "After that succulent overview, let\u2019s shift our attention to then when \u2014 when did I have those delightful visits to 7-Elevens? Was it in the morning, afternoon, or evening? Here, we\u2019ll find out.", "I\u2019ll open this section with a histogram that illustrates the distribution of the \u201cvisiting hours.\u201d", "From this histogram, we can surely tell that there\u2019s a preference for \u201clate afternoon\u201d and \u201cearly evening\u201d times. In hindsight, this makes a lot of sense, considering that\u2019s usually the time when I take a small pause after spending the entire morning exploring the city. To be more precise, the mean hour (shown with the vertical line) is 16.36, while the median is 17. Now let me ask something. Are \u201clate afternoon\u201d and \u201cearly morning\u201d the only groups here? Are there more? Or, is it possible to split these groups further to find even more granular clusters? That\u2019s the kind of question that clustering might be able to answer.", "\u201cSplitting groups\u201d and \u201cgranularity\u201d are characteristics of an unsupervised learning technique known as hierarchical clustering. These algorithms seek to group and represents data as dendrograms. There are two kinds of hierarchical clustering algorithms: agglomerative and divisive.", "The agglomerative algorithm (the one I applied), groups the data using a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach, where each observation starts as an individual cluster. As you traverse up the dendrogram, these individual clusters might merge \u2014 based on a similarity score \u2014 with others, until you have one big cluster. The second kind, divisive, is the complete opposite. Here, you start with the complete dataset under one cluster and then partition it until each observation is a cluster.", "Using this algorithm, I clustered the \u201cvisiting hours\u201d to see if I could discover additional groups:", "This image is a dendrogram of the visiting hours. On the x-axis, you can find the dataset\u2019s observations. The y-axis, height, represents the distance (according to the similarity metric) between the clusters. For example, the \u201cvisiting hour\u201d value of the first two cases, data point 65 and 72 is 0 (midnight), so the distance between them is 0. As you see, at the lowest level, there are many clusters (14) where the distance is 0. But, one level up, the clusters start the take shape. Then up, up, and up, until there\u2019s only one big cluster.", "Now comes the tricky part, how do we interpret this? How can we deduct what groups are there? For that, first, we need to decide how many groups we want. For this case, let\u2019s say five. Then, we need to cut the dendrogram in a way that exactly n clusters are produced. Like this:", "Here are the five groups. There is one consisting of two observations, another of five, 23, 33, and 34. But still, there\u2019s something essential here missing, and that\u2019s the actual visiting times. So, if we use the cluster memberships and the visiting time to which it belongs, we can plot this data to get our answer:", "The plot we see here present the hour values (y-axis) and their cluster (x-axis). From it, we can discern the groups found by the clustering algorithm. The first of them, Cluster 1, can easily be called the \u201cafternoon\u201d cluster because the times fall between 15 and 18. Then we have cluster 2, the \u201cmorning\u201d group, and cluster 4, the \u201cevening\u201d group. Last but not least is clusters 3 and 5. These two small groups consist of visits I did at odd times, e.g., 12 and 6 am.", "By just looking at these unusual points from clusters 3 and 5, we could somehow agree that these visits are outliers, or anomalies, data observations that deviate from the norm. So, how can we confirm our beliefs? With anomaly detection, of course.", "Before proceeding, there\u2019s a small change I wish to do. To make the task more interesting (and to complicate it for no reason at all), I\u2019ll add a second feature, the weekday of the visit, to the problem. That way, we will look for anomalies in a two-dimensional space. Figure 15 presents the data:", "Do you see any outliers? Maybe the points in the bottom region? Could be.", "To formally identify the anomalies, I\u2019ll use the scikit-learn implementation of the isolation forest (Liu et al., 2008) algorithm. This unsupervised learning model and I quote the paper, \u201cisolate(s) anomalies instead of profiles normal points.\u201d In other words, an isolation forest separates the anomalous point from the rest of the dataset. When applied to the dataset, the algorithm finds the following:", "Well, well, well. This is a good surprise. The red-colored region is the \u201chard\u201d decision boundary found by the algorithm, meaning that everything inside this area is an inlier, while the rest are outliers. Moreover, we also have the \u201cripples\u201d of the boundary, which let us see the algorithm\u2019s output at different confidence levels. If we interpret the outcome by just looking at the hard boundary, we would have to categorize the whole Monday and most of the late evening visits as outliers. Personally, I don\u2019t agree with that\u2014to me, they are inliers.", "But, if we consider the \u201csoft\u201d decision area, then the outcome is another one. For instance, the first level of the ripples covers Monday\u2019s most popular times and some of those evening visits I consider inliers. With a bit of hyperparameter tweaking (I used the defaults ones), I\u2019m pretty sure I could manage to get these points inside the main decision space. However, that would be \u201ctorturing the data until it confesses,\u201d and maybe even cheating. The code below shows how I created the model (the data is on the GitHub repo).", "Now comes the article\u2019s last part: fitting a time series. In this section, I will use the time series and forecasting library Prophet, to fit an additive model using the visited time data. My objective here involves studying the daily seasonality and trend components of the model to interpret the visiting times from another perspective. Let\u2019s see it:", "A daily seasonality component tells you the overall pattern observed throughout the day. On the x-axis is the time, starting at midnight and ending at 11:59 pm, and on the y-axis is the incremental effect on y of that particular time.", "The pattern described in the plot is similar to what we saw in a past graph. In the early hours of the day, the activity is at its minimum level. Then, as the day starts, so do my visits, and that\u2019s why the model reaches its maximum value around the afternoon.", "Now comes the second component of the time series, the overall trend:", "This line displays how my visits evolved over those four months. According to the graph (and I can confirm this), the highest activity occurred in the first month during my time in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. But then, in the early days of September, while I was in Cambodia, the numbers went down because of the lack of 7-Elevens in this wonderful country. After that, during my second round in Malaysia, I went back to business. But unfortunately, it didn\u2019t last that long, because my next destination, Indonesia, also had none. Last, the big push at the end is the result of spending several days in Japan, a country many would consider a 7-Eleven paradise. The code behind the time series is below:", "To briefly go through it, fitting a time series in Prophet can be done in four lines. First, we have to call the Prophet() function using an argument, the desired dataset. This input has to be a data frame with two columns: ds and y. The ds column, which stands for a datestamp, should either be a date (YYYY-MM-DD) or a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). The second column, y, is the numeric value we want to forecast.", "Do you know what\u2019s better than analyzing data? Analyzing data about yourself. In the same way that we often look at other datasets to discover exciting findings, we should look at data about our own person to find unique and fun details about ourselves\u2014if the companies do it, you can do it too! In this project, I analyzed my 7-Elevens check-ins produced during my time backpacking through Asia. With merely 99 unique observations (I\u2019m angry it wasn\u2019t 100), and an analysis that included data exploration, clustering, anomaly detection, and time series, I learned that I might have a bit of an obsession with 7-Eleven.", "PS: To clarify, I don\u2019t work with 7\u201311 or have any sort of relationship; I just like the snacks.", "This article is part of my Wander Data series, in which I\u2019m telling and reliving my travel stories with data.
