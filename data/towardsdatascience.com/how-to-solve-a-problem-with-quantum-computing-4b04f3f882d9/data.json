A qubit is not restricted to 0 or 1. It can be a combination of both states. Further, you can entangle two qubits so that they share a state of superposition.", "With these characteristics, qubits are a powerful tool. If used properly. Of course, you can treat qubits like normal bits and solve a problem the same way you solve other computational problems. But you would not benefit from the advantage a quantum computer promises. When solving a problem classically, you won\u2019t see any quantum speedup. In fact, the algorithm will be much slower because a quantum computer is extremely slow (in terms of clock frequency) and extremely small (in terms of the number of qubits).", "In this section, we learn how to solve a problem through an algorithm that could be faster than a classical one. By that, we mean the quantum algorithm will solve a problem in fewer steps than a classical algorithm requires. If both computers were equal in speed and size, the quantum computer would solve the problem faster. However, a classical computer might compensate for the larger number of steps by its sheer speed and size. But with the increasing complexity of the problem to solve, speed and size will not suffice anymore. There are problems on earth, such as the factorization problem, that are too complex for a classical computer, regardless of its speed and size. But they are not too complex for a quantum computer. Theoretically.", "Our exemplary problem is not one of these problems. A classical computer solves it in a split second. But the example allows us to demonstrate how to solve a problem the quantumic way.", "Let\u2019s assume we have a function f. It takes a single bit as an input. Either 0 or 1. And it provides a single bit as its output, too. Again, either 0 or 1.", "There are four different possible functions.", "The functions f_0 and f_3 provide constant outputs. No matter what their input is, they always return the same result. f_0 returns 0.f_3 returns 1. Always.", "The functions f_1 and f_2 provide balanced outputs because for half of the inputs they return 0 (f_1 if the input is 0 and f_2 if the input is 1) and for the other half they return 1 (f_1 if the input is 1 and f_2 if the input is 0).", "If you\u2019re given one of these functions at random, how can you determine whether the function is constant (f_0 or f_3) or balanced (f_1 or f_2)? We don\u2019t care about the specific function we got. We only care about whether it is constant or balanced.", "Classically, you have to run the function twice. You run it with the input 0. If you get 0 as the result, the function at hand could be the constant function f_0 that always returns 0. And it could be the balanced function f_1 that returns 0 if the input is 0. You have to run the function again with the input 1 to decide whether the function is constant or balanced. The constant function f_0 still returns 0. But the balanced function f_1 returns 1 for input 1.", "The same situation applies if you get 1 as the result of running the function for the input 0. You would need to distinguish between the balanced function f_2 and the constant function f_3.", "It does not help to run the function with the input 1 first, either. With either result, 0 and 1, the function at hand could be constant or balanced. You need to run the function again, with the input 0.", "In quantum computing, we only need to run the function once.", "We start with a new quantum gate. The gate O. This gate should represent our four functions f_i.

Therefore, it must have the same size of input and output. And each output must be uniquely identity the input it originates from.", "But that\u2019s a problem. The constant functions always return the same value regardless of their inputs. Given their output, you can\u2019t tell what the input was.", "We can deal with this problem with a little trick. We add a second qubit |y\u27e9 and we use the exclusive or (XOR, \u2295) operator to keep track of the result of the function f_i.", "Mathematically, the refines gate O is:", "The following figure depicts the transformation gate O.", "Let\u2019s say, i=0. Thus, we apply the function f_0. Per definition, f_0(x)=0. When we insert this into the above equation, we can see the output of O is equal to its input:", "We can safely state that not changing a state is reversible.", "The truth table of the term |x\u27e9\u2297|y\u2295x\u27e9 shows that it is reversible.", "The truth table discloses that the term |x\u27e9\u2297|y\u2295x\u22951\u27e9 is reversible, too.", "The output is like the input but with a reversed y.", "Our refined O-gate is a valid transformation gate for all our functions f_i.", "But, we\u2019re not too interested in how the functions f_i work. Rather, we regard O as a black-box. The two important things are", "The following truth table shows how the O-gate transforms pairs of qubits in the basis states.", "As usual, when we only look at qubits in the basis states, there is nothing special with a quantum circuit. Things get interesting when the qubits are in a state of superposition.", "Let\u2019s input the states |+\u27e9 (for x) and |\u2212\u27e9 (for y). We can construct these states if we apply the Hadamard gate to the basis states |0\u27e9, respectively |1\u27e9.", "Collectively, the two qubits are in the state", "Now, we apply the gate O. Thus, we replace the four basis states with the terms we calculated in the truth table above.", "We can rearrange this term by putting the basis states of the first qubit outside the brackets.", "We insert these terms into our qubit state equation", "Then, we move anything except the term |0\u27e9\u2212|1\u27e9 outside the brackets, too.", "The result is a two-qubit state in the form of |x\u27e9\u2297|y\u27e9. |x\u27e9 and |y\u27e9 are the two output qubits with the qubit |x\u27e9 is the top one.", "Let\u2019s have a closer look at the state of qubit |x\u27e9.", "The following table depicts the possible values of the qubit |x\u27e9 in dependence of f_i.", "The same accounts for the state |\u2212\u27e9, respectively", "The upfront constant amplitude of 1/sqrt(2) applies to both basis states. Its square (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2=1/2 is the probability of measuring either one state. So, half of the time we measure the qubit as 0. And half of the time we measure the qubit as 1. This applies to both states |+\u27e9 and |\u2212\u27e9. The measurement probabilities are the same for all four functions f_i.", "Unless we apply another transformation gate to this qubit. If we apply the Hadamard gate to the first qubit, it transforms the state |+\u27e9 into |0\u27e9. And it transforms |\u2212\u27e9 into |1\u27e9.", "Accordingly, we always measure 1 if the O-gate outputs |\u2212\u27e9. This is the case for f_1 and f_2. These are the balanced functions.", "So, no matter what function f_i we plug into our circuit, we can tell whether it is constant or balanced by running it only once. Something we can\u2019t achieve classically.", "This algorithm was developed by David Deutsch. He was the first to prove quantum algorithms can reduce the query complexity of solving a certain problem. The query complexity is the number of times we have to evaluate a function to get an answer.", "The underlying idea of this algorithm is to treat solving a problem as the search for a function. We don\u2019t know how the function works internally. It is a black-box. We don\u2019t have to worry about it.", "But we know all the possible outcomes of the function. And this knowledge allows us to represent the function by a quantum gate. This gate is called a quantum oracle. Therefore, we named it O-gate. Rather than repeatedly calling the function to analyze how it works, we savvily craft a quantum algorithm around the oracle to separate the outcomes that solve the problem from those that don\u2019t. In other words, we ask the oracle for an answer.", "At this point, it is of utmost importance to understand what we are asking for. The oracle will answer exactly the question we ask. Literally. It does not care about what you intended to ask for.", "In our example, we asked the oracle whether the function is constant or balanced. And this is what we get as an answer.
