More than 60 CDOs were there, hailing from across the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, and more. There was representation from the top data organizations at Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and academia. For me, it crystallized that the upcoming year is going to be an important one, as the role of the CDO becomes better defined \u2014 and starts to impact industries everywhere.", "I was inspired by the energy at the conference, and wanted to share what the most innovative CDOs are doing today that struck me as timely for every data-first company to be thinking about:", "As CDOs work to shape their roles \u2014 and as their importance to the bottom line grows \u2014 it\u2019s prompting a natural reflection on what companies should expect from their data and what it means to be truly data-driven. Some of the key takeaways I heard at the Symposium were:", "Note: For a longer rumination on the key takeaways, Tom Davenport has a great summary over at Forbes.", "But what most struck me about the above priorities \u2014 and what they signal in terms of the maturity of the role and business \u2014 was that this is a unique moment for the rise of the CDO. (After all, when it comes to government, you know we\u2019ve got a trend on our hands: earlier in July the White House mandated every agency nominate a Chief Data Officer.)", "In the private sector, the CDO role\u2019s growing importance in the organization has been signaled by:", "Every organization today needs to have a data strategy, and the CDO is the perfect person to be at the helm of that. But the challenge is how to make data initiatives successful beyond the boundaries of the data function and impactful for the broader organization.", "One CDO shared with the group that he created a new role called \u201cHead of Data Literacy,\u201d serving the entire business. This person is responsible for ensuring that each business unit in this ~10K employee organization is \u201cfluent in data.\u201d For example, they are creating a scorecard for each business unit to measure the performance of the function in terms of data skills such as Excel, SQL, R, Python, etc. They are then helping each function define goals for their data literacy aspirations (i.e., what skills should each person know and to what level of depth and breadth); training / educating the teams to help members improve their skills; and overall getting more \u201cdata-fluent\u201d as an organization.", "It is quite powerful to have a single point of accountability in the organization on the hook for getting the entire company to be data-literate in a very concrete, measurable way.", "On a panel during the Symposium, one CDO shared this great metaphor for how to think about the value of your data \u201cdefense\u201d efforts:", "Picture this: your company is a metaphorical grocery store. Imagine if all the items were disorganized on the shelves, and shoppers couldn\u2019t find the items they needed \u2014 what a terrible experience. Similarly, that\u2019s how consumers of data feel when your data is unorganized \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t know where to find the data they need. Now imagine that the items in the store were covered with brown bags. Shoppers wouldn\u2019t know what they\u2019re buying. Similarly, that\u2019s why you need to collect and organize metadata to describe and make sense of your assets.", "I\u2019ll note that large tech companies have built homegrown solutions addressing some of this, like Amundsen from Lyft and DataHub from LinkedIn.", "But the most innovative CDOs don\u2019t stop with defense. Companies are now using data as a competitive advantage; for example, using it to identify new markets ripe for disruption, new products or features to be developed, new methodologies for improving cost and efficiency. In fact \u2014 when done well \u2014 your data strategy will not only be tightly linked but also strongly influence your business strategy. Data teams today act de facto as business partners to functions, taking a seat at the table as active thought partners to their marketing, sales, customer success, product, and engineering counterparts. It is not uncommon to see data teams partake in their business partners KPIs for performance. The business success is the data organization\u2019s success.", "Bringing innovation and automation to an industry can radically change the way business gets done \u2014 from how we build, operate, and succeed. Personally, I think we will see this innovation in the form of automation and engineering concepts being newly applied to data. I wrote previously about data reliability and how teams are evolving to become more proactive in how they manage their \u201cdata downtime\u201d and the need to solve this problem in an AI/ML/automation-first, scalable way. Companies who excel in the adoption of data and new technologies to manage that data will have the upper hand.", "One CDO, based out of the East Coast, shared on a panel that one of the first things she did in her role was to organize a trip for her company\u2019s data leaders to visit their counterparts at peers on the West Coast. They met with forward-thinking data organizations to exchange best practices, learn about useful new technologies, and ensure they are pushing their thinking when it comes to data, automation, AI/ML and more. Another CDO of a Fortune 500 financial institution indicated she sees automation as a top priority for her organization; so much so that almost 30% of her and her team\u2019s work is related to identifying and adopting new platforms to make her data team more effective!", "The pace of innovation and change in the data industry is tremendous, and I can\u2019t wait to see where we are just a couple of years from now. Whether you\u2019re in a data scientist, analyst, engineer or business role, we all have the responsibility of being the best data stewards we can, and shepherding our organizations through this transformation. One thing is clear: It is certainly a special time in history to be a part of this movement.", "Your home for data science.
