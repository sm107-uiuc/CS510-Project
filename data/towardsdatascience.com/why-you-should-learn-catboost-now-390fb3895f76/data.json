And there I was, baffled by this immensely capable framework. Not only does it build one of the most accurate model on whatever dataset you feed it with \u2014 requiring minimal data prep \u2014 CatBoost also gives by far the best open source interpretation tools available today AND a way to productionize your model fast.", "That\u2019s why CatBoost is revolutionising the game of Machine Learning, forever. And that\u2019s why learning to use it is a fantastic opportunity to up-skill and remain relevant as a data scientist. But more interestingly, CatBoost poses a threat to the status quo of the data scientist (like myself) who enjoys a position where it\u2019s supposedly tedious to build a highly accurate model given a dataset. CatBoost is changing that. It\u2019s making highly accurate modeling accessible to everyone.", "Have you ever tried to install XGBoost on your laptop? Well, you know how painful it can be. Installing CatBoost on the other end is a piece of cake. Just run", "Unlike most Machine Learning models available today, CatBoost requires minimal data preparation. It handles:", "As with XGBoost, you have the familiar sklearn syntax with some additional features specific to CatBoost.", "Or if you want a cool sleek visual about how the model learns and whether it starts overfitting, use plot=True and insert your test set in the eval_set parameter:", "Note that you can display multiple metrics at the same time, even more human-friendly metrics like Accuracy or Precision. Supported metrics are listed here. See example below:", "You can even use cross-validation and observe the average & standard deviation of accuracies of your model on the different splits:", "CatBoost is quite similar to XGBoost on which I already wrote an article about. To fine-tune the model appropriately, first set the early_stopping_rounds to a finite number (like 10 or 50) and start tweaking the model\u2019s parameters. For more information about the key parameters of Gradient Boosting like learning rate and number of estimators, you may read my previous article (XGBoost\u2019s parameters are very similar to CatBoost\u2019s):", "From their benchmark, you can see that CatBoost trains faster than XGBoost and relatively similarly to LightGBM. LightGBM is known to train very fast.", "When it comes to GPU though, the real magic happens.", "One thing that CatBoost\u2019s authors have understood is it\u2019s not just an accuracy game. Why use CatBoost when there\u2019s XGBoost and LightGBM available. Well, when it comes to interpretation, there\u2019s no match to what CatBoost provides out-of-the-box.", "If this plot can be understood by most people, the underlying method used to compute the feature importances can sometimes be misleading. CatBoost provides 3 different methods: PredictionValuesChange, LossFunctionChange and InternalFeatureImportance. Everything is detailed here.", "For local explanations, CatBoost comes with SHAP, the one commonly viewed as the only reliable method out there.", "Following this tutorial, you may come with the classic output for local explanation as well as feature importances.", "That\u2019s by far the thing I like most. With high accuracy being commoditized (notably with the rise of AutoML), what becomes increasingly important nowadays is to understand on a deeper level these highly accurate models.", "Based on experience, the following plot has become a standard in model analysis. CatBoost provides it directly in its package.", "Implementing your model in production has never been that easy. Here\u2019s how to export your CatBoost model.", "Using the .save_model() method gives you the following documentation:", "That\u2019s it. You\u2019ll have a nice .py file in your repo that looks like this:", "Model\u2019s ready for production! And you don\u2019t need to set up a specific environment on the machine making new scores. Just Python 3 will do!", "Note that the documentation mentions that the Python scoring \u201cmethod is inferior in performance compared to the native CatBoost application methods, especially on large models and datasets.\u201d", "Apparently the fastest option to score new data. Save as .cbm file.", "Re-upload your model using the following code:", "There\u2019s usually a verbose input in most models in order to see how the training process is going. CatBoost has it too but it is slightly better than others\u2019. Using verbose=50 for instance will display the training error every 50 iterations, instead of a display at every iteration which can be annoying if you have many trees.", "Note the remaining time is also displayed.", "Fine-tuning a model takes time. Often you may have several lists of good parameters that make your model accurate. To take it to the next level you can even compare how models learn with different sets of parameters in order to help you make the decision on the final list of parameters to choose.", "You have a big dataset and you\u2019re afraid of training for too long? Fear no more. You can save your model while training so any interruption in the training process doesn\u2019t have to imply a full retraining of your model! More info on the snapshot option here.", "Who\u2019s too cool for school? The training material available from the doc is really helpful, even if you think you know everything about Gradient Boosted trees. They have notebooks and videos on how to use and understand CatBoost. My favourite one is surely the one from the NeurIPS 2018 conference (2nd video on this link).", "It looks like we all waited way too long before something like this made it to the open source world. If you found this article helpful, don\u2019t hesitate to give some claps, it always feels good to receive them ;)", "Your home for data science.
