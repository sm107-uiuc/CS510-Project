The unstoppable growth of data isn\u2019t expected to slow down, with reports showing that data is expected to double every 2 years for the next decade.", "This is significant, because historically, the accuracy and precision of our computational algorithms have been limited only by the data we give them.", "But while popular data types like text, visual, and numerical have surged in greater numbers, chemical information has stagnated.", "There are many reasons for this lack of data:", "The best way to work around the data problem is to make the best with what is given, else make your own data. Thankfully, there is no shortage of unlabeled chemical data online from generous sites like Chemspider, Pubchem, and Chemexpr. Unlabeled data is perfect for unsupervised learning, where input data does not need to come with a preassigned corresponding list of labeled datasets.", "Using the unlabeled carbon catalog on Pubchem, I built an deep autoencoder with which the latent layer composed of what the neural network (NN) thought as the most important details in the unlabeled SMILES dataset.", "Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture whereby output is intentionally trained to be as similar to input as possible.", "If you input a picture of a flower, the output should look as similar to the original flower as possible.", "It sort of has a aesthetically pleasing symmetrical shape to it. Data is compressed into the latent layer, colored red, similar to zipping a file. Autoencoders however, aren\u2019t necessarily better than other compression algorithms. So we have an algorithm that outputs something very similar to its input, and that isn\u2019t really better than other compression algorithms; What are Autoencoders good for then?", "Autoencoders are useful for a specific parts of its architecture; the hidden layer. Also known as the latent layer, it is essentially a condensed and concentrated layer of the data\u2019s most important features.", "This makes autoencoders prefect for dimensionality reduction and noise reduction.", "The project is broken down into 4 parts:", "The dataset is a list of over 12,000 carbon based molecules. A single element was chosen so that the autoencoder\u2019s latent layer could learn features that made carbon molecules unique compared to any other elements. Carbon was also chosen as it is one of the most versatile elements, hence having a larger dataset with greater variety, a benefit in reducing overfitting.", "The autoencoder is trained to recognize the loss between its input and output, so that the model learned to best replicated the given input. The input layers is comprised of 63 nodes, passing through 2 more filters of size 32 and 14. Each layer approximately halves the number of nodes until it reaches the bottleneck of 7 nodes in the latent layer. Upon completing the encoding process, the operation is inverted and the number of nodes per layer of the decoder increase symmetric to the encoder. The trained model therefore has a firm grasp on the unique structure of carbon molecules.", "One can think of it like a bottle of that magic essence that makes carbon so versatile.", "Once trained, the latent layer can be used in a generative model, turning the vanilla autoencoder into a variational autoencoder (VAE). Theoretically this VAE would be able to generate new carbon molecules some of which may be useful in material science, nanotechnology, or biotechnology. The model can also be used as the basis for an adversarial autoencoder (AAE), another type of generative algorithm that has outperformed VAEs in research experiments regarding the generation of molecules like drugs.", "The latent layer provides the basis for a whole host of new insights of the data it compresses. The A.I could potentially discover patterns or features in data that was not previously known to us.", "All the code and datasets for Project Charged can be found on my Github, in this repository.", "We have only just begun using A.I to help researchers in scientific disciplines accelerate their methods, produce more accurate results, and provide validation for their hypotheses. As the benefits become more known and collaboration is spurned between experts in both fields, our datasets will grow, and so too will the power of our A.I.", "Still reading this? Want more?
