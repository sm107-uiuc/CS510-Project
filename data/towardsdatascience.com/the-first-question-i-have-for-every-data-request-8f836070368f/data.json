In the lives in the same context as my earlier succeeding as a data scientist in startups post.", "There are very few absolutes in the world, death, taxes, and dirty data sets easily come to mind\u200a\u2014\u200abut when it comes to internal experts in support positions like researchers, data analysts, and data scientists, I\u2019d like to nominate another one: their reaction when someone comes to them with a request.", "\u201cTell me what problem you\u2019re trying to solve, not the solution you think you want.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAll of us, all the time", "The majority of the time, especially if there\u2019s not a lot of cross-functional experience, people will come and make a specific request for an analysis or data that they believe will help them do whatever it is they\u2019re doing. Often it\u2019s couched as a \u201csmall data request\u201d or \u201cjust a chart or two\u201d. Very often their request has little context.", "This behavior isn\u2019t even restricted to the data fields, I catch even myself doing similar things for repairmen and engineers. We\u2019re all susceptible to this.", "This happening once in a while is not a big deal. But when it happens enough times, it\u2019s maddening. Oftentimes you find battle-scarred researchers who have seen this a bit too often and have strong feelings about it.", "Still, remember that people are doing the best they can, so forgive them. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not doing it out of malice or ego. They\u2019re typically trying to be respectful of your time, or have thought about their problem a great deal before coming to you for help and their request reflects that line of thinking. Occasionally it\u2019s because they\u2019ve heard of a technique or analysis and are overly excited about it without understanding all the pros and cons.", "When\u00a0faced\u00a0with\u00a0this\u00a0situation,\u00a0I\u00a0normally\u00a0ask\u00a0some\u00a0variation\u00a0of\u00a0this, for two reasons.", "First, just about every question in an industry setting can be formulated as one or more decisions that need to be made so it\u2019s not out of place to ask. Decisions can be specific, like choosing between a set of alternatives, or more abstract like \u201cit will help inform the design of the next version\u201d. It also gets them thinking more about what they want to do. Since I always encourage people to have data conversations early on (too early is better than late), so it\u2019s expected that ideas aren\u2019t fully baked.", "Second, and much more importantly, it gets them thinking more in terms of a partnership model of working together instead of a simple \u201cask and receive report\u201d model. This is a critical habit you need everyone to get used to\u200a\u2014 come with questions, not proposed solutions.", "The whole point of asking their actual problem statement and decision point is because it starts a conversation. Conversations are good. Its your chance to learn what they\u2019re up to, and for them to better learn about how to work with data. Long term partnerships don\u2019t happen in a day, this is how they start.", "Their starting question should be able to translate into some kind of hypothesis that we can test using research toolbox, the decision frames the conversation and your future recommendations. Often it just takes a small nudge. \u201cHow many times to people click this button?\u201d is just a context-free request, but can easily turn to \u201cwe think no one uses that delete button because they delete using the keyboard, we want to remove the button\u201d. Now you have enough context to check if people really do use the keyboard more, or make a case for whether the button is used by a specific small set of users for accessibility reasons.", "From there you can work with them figuring out what data is available to answer their questions. When some data is missing, you can make a case for implementing instrumentation to get data they really want (e.g. should we log keyboard shortcuts?). At the same time, you might know of a proxy measure that already exists that may yield a \u201cgood enough\u201d result (e.g. deletes with no button clicks is probably close enough). Never assume that an exact answer is necessary or even desired, an approximation can be just as useful (especially quick ones).", "Next, you can work with them on understanding the methodology you\u2019ll be using. It\u2019s often a good idea to teach people about\u00a0the\u00a0potentials\u00a0and\u00a0limitations\u00a0of\u00a0methods, even if you have to gloss over\u00a0deep\u00a0technical\u00a0details. The reason being that if people understand how things work at a high level, they\u2019re better able to understand when you later tell them \u201cthe data let\u2019s you say this, but not that\u201d.", "Finally once the initial analysis has been done, you can reinforce the partnership by bringing the stakeholders in to go over\u00a0the\u00a0findings, answer questions, and help brainstorm next steps.", "Much like how almost every academic paper ends with \u201cand more research needs to be done\u201d, there are always more questions that could be answered. It\u2019s up to the team as a group, with your help, to decide if they have enough confidence to proceed. Keep iterating!", "Over time, as this people go through this process repeatedly, everyone should start getting the hang of it and automatically come to you with more questions and involve you in partnering to explore the problem before committing to big decisions. When that happens, you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve gotten to a good point in data-driven decision making culture.", "Your home for data science.
