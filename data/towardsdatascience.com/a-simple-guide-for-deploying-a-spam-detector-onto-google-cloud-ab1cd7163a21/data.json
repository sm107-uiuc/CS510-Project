Well, there are many guides on building machine learning model for various uses and I recently came across a guide on building a spam detector then deploy it using Flask. Through that, I\u2019ve decided to take it further by deploying onto Google Cloud Platform! But of course you could use Heroku, AWS etc but that\u2019s another topic for another day, I\u2019ll just focus on GCP for now.", "It is machine learning model for spam SMS message classification by training on existing collection of SMS massages labelled with \u2018spam\u2019 or \u2018ham\u2019.

The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution. This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality.", "Meanwhile, Flask serves as the web framework, to receive the user\u2019s input through the frontend (HTTP Request) and realizing its prediction capabilities. Born in 2010, Flask is a small framework by most standards, small enough to be called a \u201cmicroframework\u201d. Flask promotes readability and easy understanding of its source code. Flask is a lightweight Web framework written in Python and it has since become one of most widely used Python web frameworks for start-ups, and a perfect tool for quick and simple solutions in most businesses.", "Flask aims at keeping the core of the framework small but highly extensible thus writing application or extensions very easily and flexible, while empowering developer to choose their own configuration for their application", "We will use Google App Engine on a standard environment. It allows us to \u201cbuild highly scalable applications on a fully managed serverless platform\u201d. There are a few requisites or assumptions that I\u2019ll make before proceeding:", "Make sure billing is enabled for your project.

For Python 2.7, can refer to the code below:", "If you have not install the necessary libraries into the virtual environment, you can use the code below.
