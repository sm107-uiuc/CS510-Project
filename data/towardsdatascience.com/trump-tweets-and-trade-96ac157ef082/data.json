The ongoing trade skirmish with China has heated up as the U.S. and China continue their respective posturing. A fresh round of tariffs on Chinese goods took effect this past Sunday, and this time the U.S. consumer will most likely bear the burden of the 15% tariff increase. Uncertainty around the direction of trade talks remains and until significant breakthroughs are made, the stock market will continue to be driven by President Trump\u2019s rhetoric.", "Luckily for traders, the president isn\u2019t shy about tweeting his short-term views on trade. Can a S&P 500 trading strategy take advantage of President Trump\u2019s trade-related tweets and predict short-term moves in the market? I turned to topic modeling and sentiment analysis to find out. The general project design and workflow is as follows:", "Let\u2019s jump into some of the details of the project and conclude with a discussion of the results!", "7,779 of President Trump\u2019s tweets were collected from his first full day in office, 1/21/2017, to 08/14/2019. Preprocessing was imperative to ensure topic models could accurately identify tweets related to trade.", "The following preprocessing steps were performed with the Gensim and nltk python libraries:", "Example preprocessed tweet after the lemmatization and bigram stage:", "After preprocessing, the corpus and bag of words dictionary were passed along to a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. See here for a great walkthrough of LDA models in python. Simply put, LDA can be used to model the probability distribution of topics for a given tweet.", "For example, consider the case where LDA assigns a tweet a 50% chance of being related to trade, a 25% chance of being related to immigration, and a 25% chance of being related to health care. Given the breakdown of the tweet\u2019s topic probability distribution and the fact that the trade topic has the highest probability, the tweet can be classified as trade-related.", "The main hyperparameter to specify for LDA models is the number of topics. After many iterations and some subjective judgment about the adequate separation of topics, 30 topics yielded the best results.", "I used pyLDAvis to visualize the model\u2019s ability to separate topics. The intertopic distance map below indicated slight overlap between some topics, but overall the model exhibited a satisfactory level of separation.", "Parsing through the 30 topics from the LDA model, topic 9 stood out for its ability to capture terms relevant to trade with China. A full list of relevant terms for topic 9 is also listed in the pyLDAvis output below.", "Once I was comfortable with topic 9 identifying trade-related tweets, tweets related to other topics were dropped. As a result, only 590 tweets remained. I performed one last scan through the subset of tweets to ensure the model was correctly tagging tweets. An example raw tweet and its topic percent contribution is shown below:", "The example above and the remaining subset of tweets indicated the LDA model was generally accurate in identifying trade-related tweets. Happy with the topic modeling results, I turned my attention to sentiment analysis.", "After finding the relevant subset of tweets, I used Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) analysis to generate sentiment trading signals. VADER is a pre-trained sentiment model that works especially well on social media text. Setting up the VADER model and downloading the existing lexicon was a breeze. See here for a deeper dive into VADER\u2019s applications.", "VADER takes in a string of text as an input and returns a positive, neutral, negative, and compound sentiment score. Emphasis was placed on examining the compound score, which nicely wraps up the overall sentiment of a document. Compound scores range from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive). In the example below, President Trump expresses praise for President Xi and subsequently VADER gives the tweet a compound score of 0.8439.", "Compound scores were collected for all trade-related tweets. To identify tweets that have the greatest ability to move the market in the short-term, tweets with substantial positive or negative sentiment were isolated.", "Tweets that did not meet the sentiment cutoff were dropped and as a result the final subset of data included 194 trade-related tweets with significant sentiment scores.", "After finding the final set of 194 tweets, I developed a straightforward custom trading sentiment strategy to backtest on the S&P 500. Before diving into the details of the trading logic, it\u2019s important to cover some key details and assumptions I made prior to developing the trading strategy:", "While the fourth and fifth points above are idealistic and were made to make computations easier, they help offset the hypothetical negative consequences that arise as a result of the restrictions stated in point three \u2014 the time lag between signal and trade execution. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to point out that more realistic assumptions like borrowing and transaction costs will have a negative effect on any trading profits.", "Now that all key assumptions have been covered, we can turn our attention to the development of the trading strategy. At the core of any sentiment trading strategy is the theory that animal spirits will drive markets higher when sentiment is high and lower when sentiment stumbles. Given the president\u2019s executive authority to dictate tariff policies, his sentiment should have a considerable effect on U.S. equity prices. Market participants who actively follow both equity prices and President Trump\u2019s twitter feed would probably agree this correlation holds in reality, but let\u2019s see if a strategy to take advantage of the president\u2019s short-term sentiment is actually profitable. The daily trading strategy logic for the base case, positive sentiment signal, and negative sentiment signal is listed in detail below:", "Positive Sentiment Signal: Lever Up Portfolio to 200% SPY Exposure for 1 trading day", "Negative Sentiment Signal: Sell Portfolio Position and Have 0% SPY Exposure for 1 trading day", "In a nutshell, the strategy intends to increase exposure to rising U.S. equity prices and reduce exposure to falling U.S. equity prices. Let\u2019s see how the trading strategy performed in a backtest ranging from 1/21/2017 to 8/14/2019. In the graph below, the strategy portfolio is represented by the blue line, while the benchmark SPY buy-and-hold portfolio is represented by the grey line. Additionally, green arrows indicate days where buy signals were trigged and red arrows represent days where sell signals were triggered.", "The trading strategy returned 85.3% over the backtest period vs. a simple buy-and-hold SPY profit of 56.7% over the same time period! While the backtest results are encouraging, let\u2019s take a moment to consider why the strategy outperformed its benchmark and discuss limitations of the backtest.", "A quick eyeball test indicates the majority of buy signals were generated in market uptrends and sell signals were generated around minor selloffs, which is great news for the strategy. However, there\u2019s a chance that the strategy was simply lucky \u2014 in a trending bull market generating more buy signals than sell signals certainly sounds like a great way to outperform the market. With both points in mind, it\u2019s a great time to remind everyone that correlation does not imply causation. Did President Trump\u2019s sentiment actually cause the market to move? Or did the tweets just coincide with other market moving events like an economic data release or Federal Reserve speech? Understanding the actual effect of Trump\u2019s tweets is an entirely different question; distinct from this project\u2019s motivation to see if trading on President Trump\u2019s sentiment is at all profitable. For now, let\u2019s just state that there\u2019s a good chance President Trump\u2019s sentiment correlates positively with market returns.", "A more obvious limitation of the backtest is that it\u2019s just that\u2026 a test on the past. Finding a profitable backtest is a worthwhile investigation, but the true success of any trading strategy is how it performs in the future on live data.", "Lastly, let\u2019s recall that the backtest did not take into account borrowing or transactions costs. Including these in the computations would reduce the outperformance of the strategy and any expected profits in the future.", "Overall, topic modeling with LDA and VADER sentiment analysis are possible solutions to parse through the noise of president\u2019s Twitter feed and isolate his sentiment toward trade with China. Trading on sentiment signals generated over a backtest period was profitable and the outperformance over a simple buy-and-hold strategy was encouraging enough to consider tracking the strategy\u2019s performance on live data. Future work, like Granger causality analysis and event studies to isolate the actual market effect of Trump trade tweets, are also worth pursuing.", "Investors care about the president\u2019s policies and rhetoric towards trade, and until the trade war is resolved, keep an eye on Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
