How does Facebook automatically tag you in pictures? How does a computer achieve \u201cdermatologist-level\u201d classification of skin diseases?", "In all these applications, a computer must \u201csee\u201d the world: it takes in a numerical representation of electromagnetic radiation (e.g. a photograph), and it figures out what that radiation means.", "Computer vision is a broad field that combines artificial intelligence, engineering, signal processing, and other techniques, to allow computers to \u201csee.\u201d A convolutional neural network (\u201cCNN\u201d) is one kind of computer vision model.", "CNNs have enjoyed a surge in popularity over the past several years due to their excellent performance on many useful tasks. CNNs are used for all of the computer vision applications described in the first paragraph, from labeling aspects of a photograph to medical image interpretation. This post will provide an overview of how CNNs enable many exciting modern computer vision applications.", "CNN Inputs: How Pictures are Represented in a Computer", "The input to a CNN for a computer vision application is an image or a video. (CNNs can also be used on text, but we will save that for another post.)", "In computers an image is represented as a grid of pixel values \u2014 i.e. a grid of positive whole numbers. Here\u2019s a simple example where the pixel color \u201cwhite\u201d is represented by 0, yellow is represented by 2, and black is represented by 9. (For ease of visualization the colors are still displayed on the \u201cpicture representation\u201d side, even though in the computer only the numbers are saved):", "In practice, color images are represented using three grids of numbers stacked on top of each other: one grid for red, one grid for green, and one grid for blue. The elements of each grid specify the strength of the red, green, or blue color for each pixel, using a number between 0 and 255. For more details about how color images are represented, see the RGB color model.", "For the remainder of this post we will use the simplified smiley face example shown above.", "The output of a CNN depends on the task. Here are some example CNN inputs and outputs for a variety of classification tasks:", "image sources: blue dining room, Mona Lisa, cat, melanoma, chest x-ray, follicular thyroid carcinoma", "When training a CNN for any task, many training examples are required. For instance, if you were to train a CNN on animal classification, you would need a data set of thousands of animal pictures, where each picture is paired with a binary vector indicating which animals are present in that images. For more information on training and testing neural networks, see this post.", "In a CNN, different \u201cfilters\u201d (little grids of numbers) slide across an entire image, computing the convolution operation. Different filters with different numbers in them will detect different aspects of the image, like horizontal vs. vertical edges. Many different filters are used in a CNN, to identify many different aspects of an image.", "This animation shows a 2 x 2 filter sliding across the top part of the smiley face image:", "Like a feedforward neural network, a CNN is made up of \u201clayers.\u201d", "A single layer in a CNN includes three kinds of calculations:", "These three kinds of calculations \u2014 convolution, a nonlinearity, and pooling \u2014 are used to build the \u201cconvolutional\u201d part of a CNN model. A CNN that uses only these operations to obtain the final predictions is referred to as a \u201cfully convolutional network.\u201d This is in contrast to a CNN that uses some fully-connected layers after the convolutional part (fully connected layers are the building blocks of feedforward neural networks.)", "A CNN is a kind of machine learning algorithm. What exactly is the CNN learning?", "It\u2019s learning what values to use inside the convolutional filters, in order to predict the desired outputs. Filters containing different values detect different characteristics of the image. We don\u2019t want to tell the model what characteristics it needs to look for to determine if there\u2019s a cat in the picture; the model learns on its own what values to choose in each of the filters in order to find cats.", "If there are fully connected layers at the end, a CNN will also learn what numbers to use in the fully connected layers.", "A CNN filter is a square grid of numbers. The filter sizes are specified when you build the CNN. Some commonly used filter sizes are 2 x 2, 3 x 3, and 5 x 5, but they can be any size that you choose.", "When a CNN is initialized before any training has occurred, all the values for the filters are set to random numbers. Through the process of training, the CNN tunes the values in the filters so that the filters detect meaningful characteristics of the images. Here are some examples of convolutional filters of different sizes that have been randomly initialized:", "Note that in practice the numbers chosen for the random initialization would be smaller, and they wouldn\u2019t all be integers (e.g. randomly initialized filter values might be -0.045, 0.234, -1.10, etc.)", "Here\u2019s how convolution works. Let\u2019s take a tiny piece of the smiley face image, and apply convolution to it, using a 2 x 2 filter with the values (1, 2, 3, and -1):", "In the last part you can see that in order to get the last convolution value, the filter slid out of our original region. I show this because in practice we are applying convolution to the entire image, so there are still real pixels outside of the small area we\u2019ve chosen to focus on for the purposes of the example. However, considering the image as a whole, we will eventually reach a \u201creal edge\u201d with our filter and we\u2019ll have to stop. This means the output of our convolution will be slightly smaller than the original image.", "Here is the convolution output for the red region and the filter we chose:", "Once we\u2019ve finished performing the convolution, we apply a \u201cnonlinearity.\u201d This is a nonlinear equation that will allow the CNN to learn more complicated patterns overall. One popular nonlinearity is ReLU, or \u201c rectified linear unit.\u201d It sounds fancy but it is simple: you replace each negative value with a zero.", "The last step is pooling. This step results in shrinking the size of the representation. Typically we choose a pooling window of the same dimension as the filter. We chose a 2 x 2 filter, so we choose a 2 x 2 pooling window.", "Here we will perform \u201cmax pooling\u201d where we choose the highest value in each pooling window.", "It\u2019s also possible to perform other kinds of pooling, like average pooling, where we instead would take the average of all the values in the pooling window. Pooling is useful because it reduces the size of the representation, thereby reducing the amount of computation required overall.", "There Are Many Filters In One Convolutional Layer", "In the above example, we applied convolution, a nonlinearity, and pooling, to go from a 4 x 4 square of pixels to a 2 x 2 representation, focusing on just a single filter. However, in reality, one convolutional layer uses many different filters, all of the same size but with different values.", "Let\u2019s say that in our first convolutional layer we apply 32 different filters, each of size 2 x 2. Then the overall output size for the whole layer is 2 x 2 x 32. Each filter detects a different aspect of the image, because each filter contains different numbers.", "There Are Many Layers in a CNN", "We don\u2019t stop once we have our 2 x 2 x 32 representation. Instead, we can do another round of convolution, nonlinearity, and pooling \u2014 this time applying the operations to the 2 x 2 x 32 representation, instead of the original image. This second round is a second \u201cconvolutional layer.\u201d A modern CNN might have 8 layers or 99 layers, or any number of layers that the designer chooses.", "The key idea behind CNNs with many layers is that the filters in the lower layers (closer to the input image) will learn simple characteristics like where the edges are, while the filters in higher layers (more abstract) will learn complicated characteristics like what human faces look like in photographs or what pneumonia looks like on a chest x-ray.", "There are different ways to visualize what a CNN is seeing with its different filters. Figure 1 of this article shows how the first-layer filters of a CNN called AlexNet light up when looking at a picture of a cat. This article and this article contain additional filter visualizations. The video \u201cDeep Visualization Toolbox\u201d by Jason Yosinski, is definitely worth watching for a better understanding of how CNNs combine simple features (like edges) from the lower layers to detect complex features (like faces or books) with the filters of the higher layers.", "CNNs are a powerful framework for understanding images, and involve repeated application of simple operations across many layers. They are in wide use in industry and academia, and have already begun to impact fields of medicine that rely on images including radiology, dermatology, and pathology.", "The featured image is the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, which I borrowed for the \u201cemotion classification\u201d example (for the irony, since people disagree about what emotion the Mona Lisa expresses, and also because I\u2019ve been listening to a biography of Lenardo da Vinci in the car.) Here are some fun facts about the Mona Lisa:", "Over the past few years I\u2019ve curated a list of particularly helpful resources related to CNNs.
