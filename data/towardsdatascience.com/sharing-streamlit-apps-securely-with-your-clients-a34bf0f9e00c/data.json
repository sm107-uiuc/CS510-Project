You\u2019ve built your model, perhaps in a Jupyter notebook or Python script, and demonstrated to yourself how it runs when you change some of the inputs. Maybe you can show this to a data science colleague watching your laptop over your shoulder. But how are you going to make it all believable to your clients or colleagues who won\u2019t want to read your code and shift-enter through a notebook?", "Streamlit uses pure Python scripting with its own simple API to infer a modern interactive UI. You can find out more on their site if you haven\u2019t already!", "Once you\u2019ve designed your sample app, there are several possibilities for hosting online. The Streamlit developers have a beta offering, Streamlit for Teams, that allows you to \u201ceffortlessly deploy, manage, and collaborate on apps\u201d.", "The discussion forums and FAQs also detail ways to host on Heroku, Azure, and AWS. This is useful if you routinely use these cloud providers, but there isn\u2019t an automatic authentication layer: unless you\u2019re happy to open the app to everyone, you\u2019ll need to think harder about this.", "Of course all hosting solutions are likely to have costs associated, and your IT department or Information Officer may have restrictions over over storing client data there.", "For a throwaway app, it can make the most sense to find a way for your client just to run the script on their own machine. In an enterprise setting, it\u2019s not normally appropriate to expect your client to install command-line tools such as Python, conda, or pip; and even if you went that route, subtle differences between platforms and installations will mean you can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll see the same results as you did!", "Containerisation is a great approach to this reproducibility problem. Again, you don\u2019t want to leave your client with a list of command-line instructions. ContainDS is user-friendly software for running reproducible environments with a graphical user interface. It can use Docker or VirtualBox primarily under the hood, but neither you nor your client need to worry about the command-line details.", "The rest of this article will take you through the steps required to share a Streamlit sample app with a client who is also able to install ContainDS on their machine.", "To get started, install ContainDS Desktop and its underlying requirements (Docker Desktop) on your Mac or Windows computer.", "Once running, ContainDS Desktop will offer you a selection of recommended starting \u2018images\u2019 on which you can build your app. This starting point will just be a Streamlit environment (where Streamlit is already installed), where we can also install any pip/conda packages we might need, and additionally provide the Python script that makes up our app itself.", "Click \u2018SELECT\u2019 next to the streamlit-single box (if you want to exhibit multiple apps, choose streamlit-launchpad instead).", "Once the underlying Docker image has downloaded, ContainDS Desktop will ask you for the final setup options. These are just a container name (you don\u2019t need to change this), and the path to a new or existing workspace folder on your hard drive. The default provided should be a yet-to-be-created empty folder where you will place your Python file and any data files. You could choose a workspace location that already exists if you have those files available on your hard drive in advance.", "For this example, just click \u2018CREATE\u2019.", "ContainDS Desktop will create the new container \u2014 this is the virtual environment running an isolated Linux system ready to host your required packages. In ContainDS Desktop, this container is combined with the workspace folder to enable your full app to run.", "Since we do not have the Python script ready yet, the new container will run but immediately stop with the message that \u2018there are no .py scripts\u2019.", "Copy the contents of Streamlit\u2019s example intro.py into a file called intro.py in the workspace folder. You can remind yourself of the full path to your new Workspace by looking in the \u2018Streamlit Details\u2019 section in ContainDS Desktop.", "Once intro.py exists, go back to ContainDS Desktop and click the big \u2018START\u2019 button at the top. A bit more progress should appear in the logs section now, and the container should remain running (green icon on the left hand side where the container is listed):", "Click on the \u2018WEB\u2019 button or \u2018Launch Streamlit in Browser\u2019. This will launch the app in your default web browser.", "You can export this app (the container itself plus the workspace files) as one single .containds file to share directly with a client.", "In ContainDS Desktop click on the Share tab. In the Export sub-tab your Downloads folder should be specified as the default location to save this file. Click \u2018EXPORT\u2019.", "Some progress information will be displayed while the export file is created. Once complete, the output filename will be displayed.", "You can share that .containds file with your client through your usual secure channels \u2014 SharePoint, Dropbox etc. It will be too big for email\u2026", "Once received by your client, assuming they already have ContainDS Desktop installed, they can fire up ContainDS Desktop (Docker must be running unless you are proposing to use VirtualBox). On the New Container screen, click the File tab.", "Locate the .containds file you shared with them, then click \u2018START\u2019. The file will be imported:", "Once ready, the container will be running exactly as it was for you:", "Just as you did, click \u2018Launch Streamlit in Browser\u2019 and they will see the app running in their web browser. Since Docker always emulates the underlying Linux system, everything is guaranteed to run exactly as intended!", "While there are fairly simple solutions for long-term cloud hosting of polished web apps, ContainDS Desktop offers a very easy way to share your work to run locally and this is especially useful for \u2018throwaway\u2019 prototype dashboards where stepping through the hoops to host the app and the data on the internet may not be worth the time investment \u2014 at least to do so in a way that properly protects the data in a compliant manner.", "Your home for data science.
