It\u2019s interesting to note that California is not in the top five states that have incurred the highest amount in the total number of fines, although Texas, Michigan, and Florida are present. A lot of outliers are observed in the box plot as many fines incurred by the nursing homes in each of the states is zero. The median for many states is also close to zero.

What are the most important factors that affect a nursing home\u2019s overall rating?", "Answers to the above questions can help in identifying the most important factors of a nursing home affecting its overall rating. This can help a nursing home in making certain decisions to increase its rating and improve in the areas that affect its rating highly.", "A lot of textual data such as Location, Federal Provider Number, Health Survey Dates are not very useful for model fitting and such columns were dropped from the dataset. Additionally, Adjusted features have been considered instead of individual reported features. For example, instead of considering \u2018Reported Nurse Aide Staffing Hours per Resident per Day\u2019, \u2018Adjusted Nurse Aide Staffing Hours per Resident per Day\u2019 was considered.

The columns whose values are all NaN values are dropped from the dataset.", "Instead of normalizing the whole dataset, each column has been normalized to a scale of [0,1]. If normalization were performed for the whole dataset, the column containing large numbers would become dominant in decision making. Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient was calculated in between all the features of the dataset and one of the highly correlated columns in each set has been dropped from the data set as they do not provide any additional value to the model. The total number of columns has been reduced from 86 to 52 after pre-processing.", "The number of records belonging to each class (Overall Rating) is observed. Class 5 has the highest in number of records whereas the lowest belong to class 1. But the difference between them is 1000 records which is tolerable. The distribution is natural and no sampling methods are needed as no class is greatly under-represented or over-represented.", "The current task of predicting the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 is a classification task. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines are some of the robust algorithms that can be applied for Classification (Binary or Multi-class).", "Random Forest is an ensemble technique that uses multiple decision trees and allocates a class to a given instance depending on its input features. It can perform both regression and classification tasks. Data is sampled with replacement and several decision trees are trained over the extracted samples. During sampling, a percentage of data is separated and labeled as OOB (Out of Bag) data. The trained decision tree is tested over the OOB data and an OOB error estimate is obtained. Best \u2019n\u2019 trees with the least OOB error are finalized and are regarded as a single Random Forest Classifier. Given a test instance, each decision tree inside a Random Forest Classifier predicts a class. Voting like mechanism is performed and the class predicted by most of the trees is generated as the output by the Random Forest Classifier. Due to the ensemble approach, Random Forests can model the data very efficiently (Leo et al., 2020).", "Support Vector Machine is a supervised algorithm that can be used for Classification and Regression. It identifies the best hyperplane that can divide the data efficiently. It is also called as a Max \u2014 Margin classifier, as it tries to construct a hyperplane whose distance to the nearest element of both the classes is maximum (Cortes et al., 1995). Because of their proven efficiency in many classification tasks, both models were considered to model the current data.", "The dataset is divided into the ratio of 80:20 where 80% of the data forms the train set and the rest 20% forms the test set. The features on which the models would be trained is termed as X_train. For the current dataset, X_train constitutes all the 51 columns (excluding the \u2018Overall Training\u2019 column) obtained after pre-processing the dataset. The target/column that the dataset would be trained to predict is termed as Y_train and for the current dataset, it would be the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 column.", "During the training process, the machine learning model is fitted to the dataset. However, the efficiency of modeling depends upon a set of inputs given to the model which are often called hyperparameters. Depending on the data, the hyper-parameters need to be adjusted and this process is called hyper-parameter tuning. The best hyper-parameters for the training the Random Forest and the SVM models have been identified by a technique classed as K-Fold cross-validation. In this technique, the train set is divided into K folds/parts in which K-1 parts are considered as the train set and one part as the test set. A set of hyper-parameters is provided as the input and the model is trained over K-1 parts followed by testing on one part (Refaeilzadeh et al., 2009). This process is performed K times and the metrics are evaluated each time. The average of classification metrics such as average Accuracy, average Precision, average Recall, and average F1-score for the selected hyper-parameters are computed. The best set of hyper-parameters generates the highest test scores and is thus determined.", "With respect to the current dataset, 5 \u2014 fold cross-validation was performed and the optimal hyperparameters for the Machine Learning models are identified as below.", "The cross-validation scores for Random Forest and Support Vector Machines are represented in Table 2.", "At the end of cross-validation, the hyper-parameters are determined and the whole training set is trained as a single entity by the models. The models are ready to be tested on the test set.", "Each record in the test set is passed through the train set to predict the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 for that record. Each record represents a nursing home. So, the model is essentially trained to predict the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 for a nursing home, given a set of its features. The predictions are evaluated by the classification metrics \u2014 Precision, Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score.", "It can be concluded that the Random Forest classifier is the best performing model for the current dataset. It has dominated SVM on all the classification metrics such as Accuracy, average Precision, average Recall, and average F1-score.", "1. Can a machine learning model be developed that can allocate a class (overall rating) to a nursing home depending on patterns observed in the data?", "Answer: Yes. A Machine Learning model can be developed that can categorize a nursing home into one of the five-star ratings present in the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 feature. It can also be concluded that clear patterns exist in data with respect to the Overall Rating column and the Machine Learning models are being able to distinguish such patterns. So, it is possible to build reliable models over the current dataset and achieve the goal successfully. The procedure for building such a model is also stated above.", "2. If so, how reliable, and how accurate is it?", "Answer: The performance of the models can be evaluated through different classification metrics. The Accuracy of the Random Forest model is calculated as 97%. The average precision with which the Random Forest model predicts the class is calculated as 97%. In simple terms, Recall is the ratio to what has been predicted correctly to what all should have been predicted correctly. The average Recall value is also 97%. F1-score is the harmonic mean between Precision and Recall. The higher the F1-score, the better the model. The current Random Forest model achieves an average F1-score of 97% on the test set. With the help of the stated metrics, it can be concluded that the model is stable and very reliable.", "3. What are the most important factors that affect a nursing home\u2019s overall rating?", "Answer: The trained Random Forest model provides a deep insight into the most important features of the dataset. This is because Random Forest builds decision trees that model the data by picking the features that are most important with respect to the target column. They calculate feature importance by using techniques such as \u2018entropy\u2019, \u2018gini\u2019, \u2018gain-ratio\u2019, etc. For the current model, the order of feature importance is represented in Fig. 8.", "The top ten features that affect the \u2018Overall Rating\u2019 include, \u2018Health Inspection Rating\u2019, \u2018QM Rating\u2019, \u2018Staffing Rating\u2019, \u2018Total Weighted Health Survey Score\u2019, \u2018Adjusted RN Staffing Hours per Resident per Day\u2019, \u2018Rating Cycle 1 Total Health Score\u2019, \u2018Long-Stay QM Rating\u2019, \u2018Adjusted Total Nurse Staffing Hours per Resident per Day\u2019, \u2018Rating Cycle 1 Health deficiency Score\u2019 and \u2018Short stay QM Rating\u2019.", "The current paper provides a detailed description of the methods, tools, techniques, and the procedure required to answer the proposed research questions. Two Machine Learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) are built, extensive analysis and testing were performed to gain insights from the trained models. Relevant conclusions have been drawn and answers have been provided. The nursing homes can make use of the wealth of information uncovered from the data and make the necessary decisions to improve their Overall Rating.", "The interpretability of Random Forest model is very low, as it is a collection of decisions trees. When the trees are large, it becomes very difficult to visualize or interpret them. The memory and the computational costs associated with the training and testing of a Random Forest is high. The predictions are not very fast, and it may be a problem for time-sensitive applications (Jansen, 2018).", "Though there are definitive rules over which the ratings are provided to the nursing homes, it is possible that the data is not accurate. The model may not give same results for such inaccurate data records.", "The current data defines different attributes of a nursing home and different ratings given to it, along with information related to its deficiencies, penalties, and fines. However, it does not describe the socio-economic factors of the geographical area where the nursing home resides. Such information can be added to the dataset to enrich the quality of the results and find new insights.", "As the data increases, models such as Random Forest and SVM do not scale very well.
