This concept drives people to be more careful in their puck preparation for fear that too much agitation will cause the fines to accumulate at the bottom and make this problem worse.", "Some work has been done to show that agitation causes an effect that reduces shot time, and the authors believe this is caused by dry migration. However, not much work has done to specifically understand fine migration in the puck.", "I set out to investigate fines migration using a transparent portafilter as well as post-shot puck analysis. To understand how fines would move in the water, I used chalk on the top of the puck. If fines really did migrate during the shot, chalk would as well because the particles were very fine. However, I did not observe any migration, and potentially found the reason behind the lack of migration", "Socratic Coffee did an experiment where they sifted coffee, and they looked at shots where with two layers to understand if having more fines at the bottom caused flow or extraction. They did not find any significant difference suggesting if fines do migrate, they don\u2019t have a big impact on the shot.", "Barista Hustle did an experiment focused on fines migration during puck preparation by tapping the filter basket 100 times with the notion that the finer particles should drift to the bottom. However, they did not find it had an effect on shot time, which indicating that either fines didn\u2019t migrate or their migration didn\u2019t cause an issue.", "After developing and studying the Staccato shot, I determined fines don\u2019t clog the filter basket. In the Staccato espresso method, the bottom layer is a fine layer (<400um), and the shots still flow in regular times. If the fines really did clog the filter holes, it would not be possible for this shot to work.", "The fine layer has other interesting attributes like flowing very quickly for the first drop or two, but then the layer solidifies. Coffee then flows slowly and then more quickly as more coffee is extracted.", "I thought the best tool to understand this issue would be a transparent filter basket. While a few have been made, they typically are offset causing them to have a unusually large amount of headspace between the top of the puck and shower screen. Usually, this space is kept to the depth of a nickel, but in the transparent portafilters previously made, this space was the thickness of the filter.", "I used Kompresso to act as a transparent portafilter by putting the coffee above the shower head.", "Then I needed a substance as fine as fines in coffee that would not dissolve but would be able to be easy to see after the shot. I first tried flour, but flour gums together in hot water. So then I found some chalk, and I used a knife to scrap off some which quickly turned into a fine powder. I put this on the top of the coffee.", "Thesis: If fines migrate, then fine chalk should migrate as well from the top to somewhere deeper in the coffee puck.", "During the test I did not observe chalk moving deeper into the puck. When the water went into the tube, the chalk kicked up in the water, and even as pressure was applied, the chalk seemed less affected. This might be due to the surface area for fines is so small that pressure forces have less to work with.", "The main actor to move the water is pressure, which causes flow, but flow can only push a particle relative to the surface area. So I\u2019m suspecting that fine migration can happen in methods where the coffee bed is moving around and not compact, but during espresso, it seems difficult to prove.", "I pulled the puck out in my excitement, and it crumbled. But I did not see any chalk deeper into the puck than the very top.", "So I tested again with more chalk. I paid closer attention when pulling the puck out after the shot. Here is the link to the video.", "A few images from the video. I hoped to see fines going down the side if they would considering flow typically goes down the sides of the filter or tube before the center.", "I only found chalk at the top of the puck. I cut the puck in multiple ways, and I did not observe any layer past the very top where the chalk had gone deeper.", "Here is a cross-section, and chalk is only observed at the top.", "Here is another look a little closer.", "A few more photos just in case the others weren\u2019t convincing.", "This simple experiment does not show evidence for fine migration for espresso. No test fines were found deeper than the very top. Some observations suggest fine particles spin around and don\u2019t get pushed down more than other particles as more pressure is applied due to the smaller surface area.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
