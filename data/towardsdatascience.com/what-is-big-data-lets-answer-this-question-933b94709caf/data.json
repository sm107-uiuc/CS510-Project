It\u2019s been used, overused and used incorrectly so many times that it\u2019s become difficult to know what it really means. Is it a tool? Is it a technology? Is it just a buzzword used by data scientists to scare us? Is it really going to change the world? Or ruin it? First let\u2019s just say that Big Data is getting bigger every day \u201cfast\u201d so fast that 90% of the world\u2019s digital data was created in the last two years.", "Big Data? In it\u2019s purest form, Big Data is used to describe the massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to process using traditional techniques. So Big Data is just what it sounds like \u2014 a whole lot of data.", "The concept of Big Data is a relatively new one and it represents both the increasing amount and the varied types of data that is now being collected. Proponents of Big Data often refer to this as the \u201cdatification\u201d of the world. As more and more of the world\u2019s information moves online and becomes digitized, it means that analysts can start to use it as data. Things like social media, online books, music, videos and the increased amount of sensors have all added to the astounding increase in the amount of data that has become available for analysis.", "Everything you do online is now stored and tracked as data. Reading a book on your Kindle generates data about what you\u2019re reading, when you read it, how fast you read it and so on. Similarly, listening to music generates data about what you\u2019re listening to, when how often and in what order. Your smart phone is constantly uploading data about where you are, how fast you\u2019re moving and what apps you\u2019re using.", "What\u2019s also important to keep in mind is that Big Data isn\u2019t just about the amount of data we\u2019re generating, it\u2019s also about all the different types of data (text, video, search logs, sensor logs, customer transactions, etc.). When thinking about Big Data, consider the \u201cseven V\u2019s:\u201d", "Inevitably, much of the confusion around Big Data comes from the variety of new (for many) terms that have sprung up around it. Here is a quick run-down of the most popular ones:", "Big Data is important not in terms of volume but in terms of what you do with the data and how you utilize it to make analysis in order to benefit your business and organisation.", "Big data when teamed up with Analytics help you determine root causes of failure in businesses, analyse sales trends based on analysing the customer buying history. Also help determine fraudulent behaviour and reduce risks that might affect the organisation.", "Big Data technologies are very beneficial to the businesses in order to boost the efficiency and develop new data driven services. There are a number of uses of big data. For example, in analysing a set of data containing weather report to predict the next weeks weather.", "Here are some Uses of Big Data and where it is used", "The contribution of Big Data in Healthcare domain has grown largely. With medical advances there was need to store large amount of data of the patients. Big data is used extensively to store the patients health history.", "This data can be used to analyse the patients health condition and to prevent health failures in future. In this two interesting Big data visualization examples we can first hand see the power of Big data:", "Fraud detection and prevention is one of the many uses of BIg Data today. Credit card companies face a lot of frauds and big data technologies are used to detect and prevent them.", "Earlier credit card companies would keep a track on all the transactions and if any suspicious transaction is found they would call the buyer and confirm if that transaction was made. But now the buying patterns are observed and fraud affected areas are analysed using Big Data analytics. This is very useful in preventing and detecting frauds.", "The best use case of big data is the data that keeps flowing on social media networks like, Facebook, Twitter, etc. The data is collected and observed in the form of comments, images, social statuses, etc.", "Companies use big data techniques to understand the customers requirements and check what they say on social media. This helps companies to analyse and come up strategies that will be beneficial for the companies growth.", "Big Data technologies are used to predict the weather forecast. Large amount of data is feeded on the climate and an average is taken to predict the weather This can be useful to predict natural calamities such as floods, etc.", "Big Data is used in a lot of government as well as public sectors. Big data provides a lot of facilities such as power investigation, economic promotion, etc.", "Big Data is used in many other cases such as Education sector, Insurance services, Transportation. Security Intelligence, etc. Big data has become an important part for analysis and is needed in order to understand the growth of the businesses and build strategies to help it grow further.", "Big Data\u2019s recent popularity has been due in large part to new advances in technology and infrastructure that allow for the processing, storing and analysis of so much data. Computing power has increased considerably in the past five years while at the same time dropping in price \u2014 making it more accessible to small and midsize companies. In the same vein, the infrastructure and tools for large-scale data analysis has gotten more powerful, less expensive and easier to use. According to", "As the technology has gotten more powerful and less expensive, numerous companies have emerged to take advantage of it by creating products and services that help businesses to take advantage of all Big Data has to offer. According to Inc, in 2012 the Big Data industry was worth $3.2 billion and growing quickly. They went to say that \u201cTotal [Big Data] industry revenue is expected to reach nearly $17 billion by 2015, growing about seven times faster than the overall IT market\u201d.", "Businesses have also started taking notice of the Big Data trend. In a recent survey, \u201cEighty-seven percent of enterprises believe big data analytics will redefine the competitive landscape of their industries within the next three years.\u201d", "Data has always been used by businesses to gain insights through analysis. The emergence of Big Data means that they can now do this on an even greater scale, taking into account more and more factors. By analyzing greater volumes from a more varied set of data, businesses can derive new insights with a greater degree of accuracy. This directly contributes to improved performance and decision making within an organization.", "Big Data is fast becoming a crucial way for companies to outperform their peers. Good data analysis can highlight new growth opportunities, identify and even predict market trends, be used for competitor analysis, generate new leads and much more. Learning to use this data effectively will give businesses greater transparency into their operations, better predictions, faster sales and bigger profits.", "What the future of Big Data really holds, no one can predict. The rapid development of new technologies, especially in the machine learning space, will undoubtedly usurp any predictions we try to make. What is certain, is that Big Data is here to stay. The amount of data we are producing is only going to increase and by analyzing it, we can learn and eventually be able to predict some pretty cool things. Very soon, Big Data will touch and transform every industry and every piece of your daily life.", "Whether or not you believe the hype about whether Big Data will change the world, the fact remains that learning how to use the recent influx of data effectively can help you make better, more informed decisions. The thing to take away from Big Data isn\u2019t it\u2019s largeness, it\u2019s the variety. You don\u2019t necessarily need to analyze a lot of data to get accurate insights, you just need to make sure you are analyzing the right data. To really take advantage of this data revolution, you need to start thinking about new and varied data sources that can give you a more well rounded picture of your customers, market and competitors. With today\u2019s Big Data technologies, everything can be used as data \u2014 giving you unparalleled access to market factor.", "If you want to get in touch and by the way, you know a good joke you can connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
