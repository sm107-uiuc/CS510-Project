A few rules for how (not) to be an idiot with AI follow naturally from that example, but let me spell them out for you explicitly. (My condolences if they sound eerily familiar.)", "In the previous episode, you played the role of Mr. Bean\u2019s patient professor. Since you\u2019re getting good at it, let\u2019s have you stick with it. I\u2019ve often said that the best way to avoid the biggest pitfalls in applied AI is never to forget the basics of learning and teaching, so I\u2019m secretly hoping you\u2019ll keep the mindset of Mr. Bean\u2019s professor forever.", "Never forget the basics of learning and teaching!", "Quick reminder of the three phases (explained in more detail in the previous article):", "The training phase is fairly straightforward\u2014you shove examples into students (data into machine learning algorithms) and mostly hope for the best (I\u2019m only half kidding). Learn more about how it works here.", "Before we list the ways to be an AI idiot, let\u2019s talk about the more subtle phases \u2014 validation and testing \u2014 from your esteemed professorial perspective.", "If all you care about is failing unworthy students, you don\u2019t need a validation phase. All you need is testing. Poor Mr. Bean trains, finds a pattern (it was a stupid pattern), rushes to your exam, fails the exam, and gets kicked out of the math major. You caught and executed an ignoramus. Great job!", "Testing is about gatekeeping. Only the worthy should pass! Testing keeps you safe from releasing bad prototypes.", "But where\u2019s your desire to help your students improve? Where\u2019s your commitment to helping them be better? Where\u2019s their opportunity for redemption and self-improvement? Validation, that\u2019s where.", "Validation is about redemption. It\u2019s an opportunity to dust yourself off and try again. Validation allows you to iterate towards better prototypes.", "If you really care about your students, it would be sad to find out that their attempts at a recipe are silly only after it\u2019s too late to help them. (On the final exam itself.) What are you, a teacher or an executioner?", "What are you, a teacher or an executioner?", "If your end goal is to train qualified and effective students, you\u2019ll want to provide practice problems (from the validation dataset) to help your students improve before they face the professorial guillotine.", "While the leader of an AI project might be excused from knowing the mathematical nitty gritty that their engineers and data scientists handle, there\u2019s no excuse for forgetting the basics of learning and teaching. If you\u2019ve ever thought about setting an exam, you already have most of the common sense tools you need to prevent some major process kablooies. Here are a few examples.", "If your examples are bad, you should feel bad. How can you expect a student to learn effectively if you don\u2019t give them enough high-quality examples to learn from? Oh, and if you give your student biased examples, you\u2019ll get a biased student. That\u2019s your fault, professor.", "That exam is no good to you if it can be passed by memorization. Machine learning is for succeeding on new examples \u2014 skip the ML/AI headache and use a lookup table if all you care about is performing well on old stuff. To guarantee that you\u2019re assessing the right thing (performance on new data) instead of ability to memorize old data, make sure your student never had the opportunity to study (er, memorize) any of your test examples.", "Never put training or validation data on the final exam, it only reduces your ability to test your student properly. (Oh, and did I mention that computers are the best memorizers ever?)", "How are you going to prevent the issue above if you haven\u2019t carefully curated and split your data before diving into it? Data splitting is the best data science quick fix there is. Be sure to lock the testing examples in a safe place before you start teaching your students.", "About to facepalm? Stay thy hand! While this one seems too obvious to mention, you\u2019d be amazed how often real project teams with weak leadership perform the test and then move the goalposts afterwards, so that the score of their student ends up being good enough no matter what. Don\u2019t do this. (Learn more here.)", "If you\u2019re tempted to roll your eyes at those fussy statisticians who insist that you cannot use a test dataset more than once, let\u2019s try it saying it a different way: \u201cIf you give the same student the same final exam two times, do not trust their performance on the second time around.\u201d Don\u2019t reuse the exam questions!", "Testing is what saves you from disaster. It\u2019s your protection against approving poisonous prototypes. If you really don\u2019t care about it (for example if you\u2019re making art), have the guts to set your minimum required performance bar at -inf. No? Okay, test properly then.", "There\u2019s still one weak link left over: you, professor. What if you didn\u2019t realize that you set a bad exam? It could happen to the best of us. Be sure to build in some safety nets to keep the world safe from your freshly-graduated student, just in case.", "When teams lack skilled AI leadership or when they get too caught up in the nitty gritty of engineering, their common sense can go right out of the window. They can lose sight of the basics and end up releasing truly awful solutions. Almost every nasty ML/AI disaster I\u2019ve seen in real life could be traced to one of the items from the list above, so if you\u2019re after the AI dunce hat, I\u2019ve given you a nice list of mistakes to choose from, help yourself!", "But if you\u2019d prefer to build good, useful, and effective AI solutions, then keep the professor\u2019s perspective in mind at all times. Move over, machine learning\u2026 it\u2019s time to think about machine teaching!", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Your home for data science.
