The result of the equality query is a logical value ( TRUE or FALSE). In this case, it is TRUE because TRUE equals TRUE .", "On the contrary, TRUE == FALSE will give us FALSE.", "Apart from logical variables, we can also check the equality of other types, such as strings and numbers.", "Both of these output FALSE .", "The most basic form of comparison is equality. Recall that it is represented by the double equations syntax, ==. Here is an example of some equality statements:", "Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: \u201cR\u201d is not equal to \u201cr\u201d.", "Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) and = (assignment), == is what is used to check equality of R objects.", "The opposite of the equality operator is the inequality operators, written as an exclamation mark followed by an equals sign ( != ).", "For example, the sentence \"hello\" != \"goodbye\" would read as: \u201chello\u201d is not equal to \u201cgoodbye\u201d. Because this statement is correct, R will output TRUE .", "The inequality operator can also be used for numerics, logicals, and other R objects.", "The result of the equality operator is the opposite for the inequality operator.", "The inequality comparator is simply the opposite of equality. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE :", "Write out expressions that do the following:", "There are also cases where we need more than simply equality and inequality operators. For instance, what about checking if an R object is \u2018less than\u2019 or \u2018greater than\u2019 another R object? In this case, we can use the less-than < and greater-than > sign for this.", "In the case of numerical values, it is pretty straightforward. For example, 3 is less than 5, so 3 < 5 will evaluate to TRUE , while 3 greater than 5 (3 > 5 ) will evaluate to FALSE.", "For numerics, this makes sense. But how would this work for character strings and logical values?", "For character strings, R uses the alphabet to sort them. So, \"Hello\" > \"Goodbye\" would evaluate to TRUE since \u201cH\u201d comes after \u201cG\u201d in the alphabet, and R consider it greater.", "For logical values, TRUE corresponds to 1 and FALSE corresponds to 0. So is TRUE less than FALSE ? No, because 1 is not less than 0, hence the FALSE result.", "We can also check to see if one R object is greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) another R object. To do this, we can use the less than sign, or the greater than sign, together with the equals sign.", "So, 5 greater than or equal to 3 5 >= 3, as well as 3 greater than or equal to 3 3 >= 3 will evaluate as TRUE.", "Apart from equality operators ( == and != ), we also learned about the less than and greater than operators: < and >. We can also add an equal sign to express less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively. For example, the following all evaluate to FALSE:", "Remember that for string comparison, R determines the greater than relationship based on alphabetical order. Also keep in mind that TRUE is treated as 1 for arithmetic, and FALSE is treated as 0. Therefore, FALSE < TRUE is TRUE .", "Write R expressions to check whether:", "We already know that R is pretty good with vectors from the Introduction to Vectors post. Without having to change anything about the syntax, R\u2019s relational operators also work on vectors.", "Suppose you have recorded the daily number of views your LinkedIn profile had in the previous link and stored them in a vector, linkedin.", "If we want to find out on which days the number of views exceeded 10, we can directly use the greater than sign.", "For the first, third, sixth, and seventh element in the vector, the number of views is greater than 10, so for these elements the result will be TRUE.", "We can also compare vectors to vectors. Suppose you also recorded the number of views your Facebook profile had the previous week and saved them in another vector facebook.", "When are the number of Facebook views less than or equal to the number of LinkedIn views? We can use the following expression to calculate this.", "In this case, the comparison is done for every element of the vector, one by one. For example, in the third day, the number of Facebook views is 5 and the number of LinkedIn views is 13. The comparison evaluates to TRUE, as 5 is smaller than or equal to 13. This means that the number of Facebook views is less than or equal to the number of LinkedIn views on the third day.", "Using the same social media vectors above, linkedin and facebook , which contain the number of profile views over the last seven days, use relational operators to find a logical answer ( TRUE or FALSE ) for the following questions:", "From the output, we can determine the following:", "Up to now, we\u2019ve learned and compared logicals, numerics, strings, and vectors. However, R\u2019s ability to deal with different data structures for comparisons does not stop at matrices. Matrices and relational operators also work together seamlessly!", "Suppose, instead of in vectors (like in the previous for you to try), the LinkedIn and Facebook data is stored in a matrix called views instead.
