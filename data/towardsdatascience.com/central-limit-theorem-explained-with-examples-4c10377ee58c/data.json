Before we go in detail on CLT, let\u2019s define some terms that will make it easier to comprehend the idea behind CLT.", "It is not always feasible or possible to do analysis on population because we cannot collect all the data of a population. Therefore, we use samples.", "Two terms that describe a normal distribution are mean and standard deviation. Mean is the average value that has the highest probability to be observed. Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the values are. As standard deviation increases, the normal distribution curve gets wider.", "Normal distribution is used to represent random variables with unknown distributions. Thus, it is widely used in many fields including natural and social sciences. The reason to justify why it can used to represent random variables with unknown distributions is the central limit theorem (CLT).", "According to the CLT, as we take more samples from a distribution, the sample averages will tend towards a normal distribution regardless of the population distribution.", "Consider a case that we need to learn the distribution of the heights of all 20-year-old people in a country. It is almost impossible and, of course not practical, to collect this data. So, we take samples of 20-year-old people across the country and calculate the average height of the people in samples. According to the CLT, as we take more samples from the population, sampling distribution will get close to a normal distribution.", "Why is it so important to have a normal distribution? Normal distribution is described in terms of mean and standard deviation which can easily be calculated. And, if we know the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution, we can compute pretty much everything about it.", "Let\u2019s go over a few examples and prove that CLT is true. We will use python libraries to create populations, samples, and plots. As always, we start with importing related libraries:", "We first define a function that will create random samples from a distribution. We can use sample function of pandas that will select random elements without replacement.", "We just need to input a population, how many samples we need (sample_qty), and the how many observations each sample includes (sample_size). Then the function will pick samples and calculate their means. The returned list will include the sample means.", "Let\u2019s first define a population that actually has a normal distribution. We use np.random.randn function to create an array with a size of 10000 and a normal distribution.", "Now we take 30 samples from this population and each sample includes 30 values. Please note that we need to convert the population to pandas series because sample function will not accept numpy arrays.", "The sampling distribution (distribution of sample means) looks pretty close to a normal distribution. As we take more samples with larges size, sampling distribution will look more \u201cnormal\u201d.", "Let\u2019s apply the same procedure to a population with random distribution. We first create an array with 1000 random numbers:", "Let\u2019s see how sampling distribution will look like with 30 samples with 30 values each:", "It is getting close to a normal distribution. We now try with 50 samples and also increase the sample size to 50:", "It definitely looks more \u201cnormal\u201d. I added the code as texts so you can just copy-paste and try out with different sample quantity and sizes.", "We can also try the exponential distribution and see CLT applies:", "If we randomly take 50 samples with a size of 50, the distribution of the sample means look like:", "It looks more like a normal distribution than an exponential distribution. With 100 samples, normality is more prominent:", "As we have seen in the examples, regardless of the population distribution, the distribution of sample means get closer to a normal distribution as we take more samples.
