They are one of the most technologically advanced innovations created by humans to date. Like any new technology, there will be new ethical issues surrounding it.", "Is it ethical to produce self-driving cars whose choices will affect the livelihood of the driver and surroundings?", "I\u2019ll discuss evidence on why it is ethical to produce self-driving cars, as well as the evidence against the production of self-driving cars. After taking a consequentialist approach to analyze both sides, I will conclude with the most ethical answer to the question above.", "Their expectation is to be able to utilize autonomous cars to get them from point A to point B. They value the innovation, efficiency, reliability, safety, and accessibility of self-driving cars.", "Their expectation is to be able to provide the service demanded by self-driving car enthusiasts. They value the openness of society towards the creation of autonomous cars, the freedom to innovate, and the ongoing support from self-driving car enthusiasts.", "Their expectation is to not be harmed by autonomous cars when they are traveling. They believe it is the social and corporate responsibility of companies and the government to ensure the safety and well-being of all bystanders. They value that self-driving car companies and owners will be responsible for any harm caused by their cars.", "Their expectation is to improve society by creating rules and regulations for new innovations, minimizing risk, and protecting citizens. They value safety, efficiency, and productivity.", "The utilitarianism of autonomous cars has been both vigorously defended and attacked. When humans get into the driver\u2019s seat of a car, positive law states that they take full responsibility for their actions. When it comes to self-driving cars, there is a clear gray area: is the driver responsible for any harm to innocent bystanders who get hurt from self-driving cars? Or is the self-driving car responsible for harm to innocent bystanders? Human drivers and self-driving cars who get into accidents must make split-second moral choices on whether to protect themselves or others. Because of the grey area, there have been many debates on whether self-driving cars are ethical.", "Opponents of the self-driving cars have valid reasons. Some people believe that car accident should happen naturally versus predetermined results decided by algorithms months to years in advance. Some people also believe that it is unethical for other people to decide one\u2019s destiny. By handing the driving experience to autonomous cars, drivers lose control of their destiny. The amount of data collected and stored raises additional concern for some people. People are afraid that hackers will not only steal their private data but can also cause major harm to society. They believe it is the social and corporate responsibility for companies, governments, and policymakers to protect innocent bystanders from harm.", "To me, the positives outweigh the negatives for autonomous cars. First, self-driving cars are created by some of the most innovative and educated people of today\u2019s society. The intent of the inventors is to create a better society for drivers and the planet. In addition, self-driving cars have proven to be significantly safer than having an actual driver; this has been shown by numerous studies and data collected from them. In the long run, autonomous cars will increase efficiency and productivity for people around the world. For more people to feel at ease with self-driving cars, companies, and self-driving car owners should understand they are responsible for the safety of all stakeholders. Risk management techniques can be used to quantify probabilistic risk in a way that is transparent and flexible. To create ethical vehicles, developers should continue to learn from past experiences in risk management and morally challenging situations.", "Allowing self-driving cars will satisfy the expectations and values of self-driving car enthusiasts, drivers, and companies who produce these cars. As science and technology advances, it is inevitable that more inventions will be developed. In the case of the self-driving car, this creates both opportunity and harm. Humans will need to create tools, such as rules and regulations, to protect themselves. As more laws and regulations develop regarding autonomous cars, these will work to balance both the ethics and economics of self-driving cars.", "Beall, A. (October 18, 2017).
