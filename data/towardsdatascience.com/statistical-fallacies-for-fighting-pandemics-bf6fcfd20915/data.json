However, as statistician Nate Silver said,", "Numbers have no way of speaking for themselves\u2026 we imbue them with meaning.", "Without statisticians to interpret and draw meaning from all this data, it is at best meaningless, and at worst damaging!", "We see statistics in the headlines every day. It affects how we respond to the pandemic; it influences whether we go to the shops, visit our friends and family, or wear a mask. But it also influences wider society, particularly medicine and policy.", "Epidemiologists rely on statistics to understand how, where and to whom the virus spreads, whilst politicians work with scientific and statistical advisory committees to ensure the rules, restrictions and governmental support they implement have the greatest positive effect.", "If these data are misunderstood in the midst of a pandemic that has already caused so much damage, it can have a detrimental impact on a global scale. So Ross Clark is right, statisticians have an essential role to play, which can have a global sway on the path of the Covid-19 pandemic.", "And unfortunately, it is true that statistics are so often misunderstood. Somewhat satirically, Paul Battley collated a list of everything the Daily Mail says causes and prevents cancer. Whether reliable or not, each of these articles is based on some statistical evidence. Yet we see that motherhood, fibre and wine, amongst other things, have been claimed to both cause and prevent cancer. Somewhere, the evidence is being misunderstood.", "In this article, we will look at statistical fallacies, mistaken statistical beliefs caused by a failure to truly understand the underlying logic behind data. We will see how, understood and applied correctly, they can help us understand and combat the spread of disease. And on the flip side, how they can be detrimental if misunderstood.", "Do you think you\u2019re the most popular person in your friendship circle? Or perhaps just one of the more popular ones? Well\u2026according to statistical theory, you\u2019re probably wrong.", "In 1991, the sociologist Scott L. Feld published an article which stated,", "If individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate\u2026the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals.", "The friendship paradox is an example of sampling bias, a type of bias where some members of a population have a higher probability of being selected than others. In the case of social networks, if an individual has more friends, then they are more likely to be friends with a particular individual.", "Therefore, the friendship paradox tells us that for any randomly chosen individual, their friends will generally have more friends than they do.", "Understanding friendships (or more generally, connections) is crucial for the tracking of pandemics. People can only pass on a virus to people they have been in close proximity to, and people are generally in close proximity to their friends.", "As people with more friends will generally be in close proximity to more people, they are likely to contract a given virus sooner than the general population. This makes these \u2018popular\u2019 individuals very important in the early detection of pandemics.", "However, in a large population, mapping social networks to find these individuals is extremely difficult.", "In late 2009, a group of researchers followed a flu outbreak at Harvard University. They randomly selected 744 undergraduate students and split them into two groups:", "They noted that the \u2018friend\u2019 group progressed 13.9 days ahead of the random group and that their peak occurred a full 46 days before the peak of the population as a whole.", "Based on the friendship paradox, the average number of friends of participants in the \u2018friend\u2019 group is going to be higher than the random group. As they had more friends, they were in close proximity to more people and contracted the virus sooner than the population as a whole.", "So, to detect the early onset of a pandemic, take a random sample of the population and, instead of monitoring them, monitor their friends.", "In 1973, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published an article in the Psychological Review, On the Psychology of Prediction, in which they presented several experiments to explore how peoples\u2019 judgments affect their predictions.", "In one such experiment, they asked two groups to classify engineers and lawyers into their respective fields based on a thumbnail description. One such description, of an engineer, was", "Jack is a 45-year-old man. He is married and has four children. He is generally conservative, careful, and ambitious. He shows no interest in political and social issues and spends most of his free time on his many hobbies which include home carpentry, sailing, and mathematical puzzles.", "Each group was presented with five such descriptions, which were said to be from a random sample of 100. The only difference between the two groups was that one was told that 30% were engineers, whilst the other was told that 70% were engineers.", "What Kahneman and Tversky found was that the construction of the population made little difference once people were provided with the descriptions.", "Dick is a 30-year-old man. He is married with no children. A man of high ability and high motivation, he promises to be quite successful in his field. He is well liked by his colleagues.", "This description was created to be uninformative with regards to the career of the individual and the median probability of the individual being an engineer was 50% for both groups, despite the different underlying probabilities. This led them to conclude that", "When no specific evidence is given, the prior probabilities are properly utilized; when worthless specific evidence is given, prior probabilities are ignored.", "This is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people ignore base rate information when also provided with specific information.", "An example of the base rate fallacy is the false-positive paradox, which occurs when the number of false positives exceeds the number of true positives.", "Imagine a test for a virus which has a 5% false-positive rate, but not false-negative rate. A population of 2,000 people are tested, in which 30% have the virus. In this case, 600 people will receive a true-positive result. Of the 1,400 without the virus, 70 (5%) will receive a false-positive. Therefore, of the positive results, 600/(600 + 70)\u224890% will correctly indicate infection.", "Now imagine a population in which only 3% are infected. In such a case, 60 people will receive a true-positive. Of the 1,940 without the disease, 97 (5%) will receive a false positive. Therefore, of the positive results, only 60/(60+97)\u224838% will be correct!", "A test administrator who has experience with the first population will assume that a positive result means that the person most likely has the virus. However, because the prevalence of the virus in the second population is so low, even though the chance of a false positive is very low for a particular individual (only 5%), there are more false positives (62%) than true positives overall.", "Therefore, in order to understand the true extent of a virus through the use of tests, it is not only important to understand the efficacy of the test on an individual basis, but also to have an appreciation of the overall extent (base rate) of the virus in the population.", "Have you ever been surprised to meet someone and find out they have the same birthday as you? It is quite a coincidence, as only 1 in 365 people will share your birthday (we\u2019ll ignore February 29th).", "Therefore, people are often surprised to hear that if you have a group of 23 people, the chance that any two share the same birthday exceeds 50%. In fact, once there are 70 people in the group the probability is 99.9%!", "This may seem strange, but there is a large difference between you sharing your birthday with someone in a group, and anybody sharing their birthday with someone in the group.", "Although the probability that any pair share a birthday is 1 in 365, you have to look at all the combinations of people. With a group of 23, that\u2019s 253 comparisons, which is far more than half the number of days in a year (183 days).", "This is known as the birthday paradox, an example of the multiple comparisons fallacy.", "In any statistical study, results are used to draw inferences. That is, although evidence points to a particular conclusion, there is always a possibility that the results have occurred purely by chance. This probability is known as the confidence level.", "In 1992, a study in Sweden investigated the health repercussions of living within 300 meters of a high-voltage transmission line. The study reported that the risk ratio for childhood leukaemia was almost 4!", "However, three years after publication the full extent of the research was made public, and revealed that nearly 800 risk ratios were reported, each with a 95% confidence level. According to Frontline,", "The problem is, when you do as they did, hundreds and hundreds of comparisons, something in the neighborhood of 800 different comparisons, by the standard way we do statistics, we would expect 5 percent of those to be statistically elevated and 5 percent to be statistically decreased.", "Just like with birthdays, when you look at any pair of variables in isolation, the probability of the result being by chance is small, in this case only 5%. However, when we start to increase the number of combinations of variables, that value quickly increases.", "Early studies into any new disease will look at risk factors. These are factors that increase your risk of developing a disease. When these studies start, there is an almost endless list of possible risk factors (age, gender, ethnicity, diet, etc.).", "Therefore, a well-grounded understanding of the multiple comparisons fallacy and its effect on confidence levels is necessary to ensure that risk factors are not reported based on results that have only occurred by chance.", "To quote the phrase popularised by Mark Twain,", "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.", "We have seen that, unfortunately, statistics can indeed act as a breeding ground for lies, whether intentional or not. Statistical paradoxes and fallacies are very common and can be used to misunderstand perfectly sound data.", "However, on the flip side, statistics can be a powerful tool, with far-reaching positive effects, if used correctly. They can impact no only our individual beliefs and actions, but also wider policy.", "During the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen data and statistics everywhere, whether justifying policy, proving the efficacy of a vaccine or creating a headline.", "So, to return to Ross Clark, statisticians do indeed have an essential role in the Covid-19 crisis, and in any other pandemic. And they should be held accountable for their impact!", "Principal Data Scientist at Accenture, NLP enthusiast, Physics graduate https://bit.ly/320ih6p"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
