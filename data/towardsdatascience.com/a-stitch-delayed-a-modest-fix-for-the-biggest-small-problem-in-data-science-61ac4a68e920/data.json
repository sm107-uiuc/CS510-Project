I would argue that it is, perhaps perplexingly, completely out of the hands of the author. A result is any number, figure or concept that is used by others.", "And this is why it\u2019s so important that we\u2019re careful that we as authors clearly demark results, and their obscure cousin summary statistics.", "A summary statistic seeks to explain the spread, skew and shape of data in as few numbers as possible \u2014 they help the authors display, and the readers understand, telltale metrics which we might apply to any dataset. They do not attempt to describe the general form of the data, only some pertinent features (for example, the range of a dataset \u2014 the difference between the highest and lowest value \u2014 may be useful, but it tells you nothing of the distribution within those values).", "Everything I propose in this essay is to be applied to numbers that are (or might be) read as results \u2014 numbers that seek to represent the general behaviour of all the data, that can be quoted and reused with confidence.", "Results are the numbers we inherit. The numbers that can go untested and unchecked for decades. The numbers that can become common parlance and spread across the globe. The numbers that feed into and influence new results and new thought cascading forwards through time.", "Results are exchanged \u2014 they are shared and given \u2014 we need to know that what we say is a fair representation.", "And if we can express them simply, generally (perhaps universally) then it is easier for others to understand, appraise and benefit from them.", "The most truth in the least information \u2014 how do we say something meaningful about data in as few words as possible?", "Let\u2019s start with a dataset, and from there explain how we might go about constructing a result, and the merits and dangers of different methods of doing so.", "The picture to the left is taken from a publication. Let\u2019s pretend however that the three panels come from an analysis we did \u2014 asking 1000 people to guess the number of balls in a jar and it\u2019s total weight.", "Each person\u2019s answer can be thought of as a position in a 2D plane \u2014 x, the number of balls and y, the weight. If we put a pin in at the x,y coordinates of every person we would see some regions are full of pins (hopefully near the correct answer), and some are nearly empty (like if someone thinks there are 10 balls and it ways a metric ton).", "The bottom right panel shows the density of their guesses \u2014 like contour lines on a hill \u2014 rising to a smooth peak in the region where the most people guessed. The plots above and to the right are, respectively, the distribution of x and y individually (though not quite correct you could think of these as cross-sections of our hill, if we were to cleave it along the x and y direction).", "We can see that people are in relatively good agreement about the weight \u2014 most answers fall in a small region, and the spread is ~even about that region.", "But, the number of balls causes more problems. People tend to overestimate by a much larger amount than they underestimate (imagine three consecutive respondents guessing 10, 100 and 1000). There is a peak \u2014 but there\u2019s an asymmetry around it.", "It\u2019s in dealing with this asymmetry that the current convention goes awry.", "One of the most common ways to summarise data is by looking at the median (if we put all the data in ascending order, the value in the middle) and the 16th and 84th percentile (the values roughly 1/8 and 7/8 of way along our ordered list).", "*which coincidentally is my sort code", "They relate to every statisticians old friend \u2014 the normal distribution \u2014 an almost eerily universal representation of how data is grouped at a peak value, and spread evenly around it. This allows us to well describe lots of datasets in just two values \u2014 a mean (peak value) and a standard deviation (spread).", "We can see that applying this to the y values above we\u2019d get a perfectly good fit. Voila \u2014 not a bad result, and in just 2 numbers! (by which I mean if we just wrote down the two numbers \u2014 let\u2019s say a mean of 1 kg and a spread of 200 g \u2014 you could draw a curve that looks acceptably similar to our data without ever having seen it)", "So sensibly applying a normal distribution to appropriate data and recovering two numbers is a great idea. If you can do it, do!", "But much of the time, as is the case with our x data, we cannot. There is no way to describe asymmetry in these two parameters, we need a third. We have lots of options but I want to map out 3 \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly.", "What if we made a normal distribution out of wet-sand, and tilted it?", "We\u2019d get a skewed distribution, with two assymetric tails. If we tilt our sandpile to the left we get negative skew (more of the distribution above the mean) and to the right positive.", "However, we\u2019re still describing our data via the mean and standard deviation, now just with an extra, esoteric parameter. Plenty of readers may have furrowed brows about the choice of which skew is positive and negative, and more so when they\u2019re told how to calculate it.", "With these three numbers we almost certainly could reconstruct the distribution of x \u2014 but drawing it is a nightmare. We have all the information we need, but just in an abstract form \u2014 there are no easy error bars and no obvious way to quote and plot the result.", "It\u2019s a perfectly good way of doing things, if you like that sort of thing, but it\u2019s ugly and unintuitive (come at me tho).", "I have not yet delivered on my promise of explaining these numbers. Let\u2019s fix that.", "16% of the area under a normal distribution lies to the left of 1 standard-deviation below the mean.", "84% of the area under a normal distribution lies to the left of 1 standard-deviation above the mean.", "Thus if we have normally distributed data these two numbers, when compared to the mean, tell us the standard deviation. Twice.", "And when the distribution is not perfectly normally distributed, these two numbers tell us\u2026 nothing?", "There\u2019s a fundamental problem here \u2014 16 and 84 (and 50 for that matter) are three numbers relevant only to the strictly symmetric normal distribution \u2014 and yet we are trying to use them to describe a different, asymmetric distribution.", "Theres a disconnect between what we\u2019re measuring and how we\u2019re measuring it. Obviously there\u2019s a relation between the two, but there are some non-linear steps we must take to go from one to the other. This is like measuring the biomass of a forest in terms of the weight of the seeds. There\u2019s information there, but it\u2019s abstracted away from being useful.", "As a great demonstration of this, try and draw a distribution given the 16th, 50th and 84th percentile values.", "If you\u2019ve drawn anywhere between 0 curves and an infinite number you\u2019ve missed the mark. These three numbers do not sufficiently constrain a curve and do not relate to any model.", "Let that sink in for a second.", "The distribution of x in our experiment is a great example of this. Those three dashed lines show the 16\u201350\u201384%.", "Imagine taking away the distribution and just leaving those \u2014 then passing the plot on to someone else and asking them to explain the distribution.", "Who would look at those three lines and think to put the peak waaay over to the left. Who would guess at the length of that tail to the right.", "Who would, if this was given as a result, be able to interpret the true form of the data.", "At this point you may be thinking \u201cyeah, that methods terrible \u2014 so why would anyone do it?\u201d", "Or you may be thinking \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not great, but it gets the job done \u2014 don\u2019t rock the boat\u201d", "The first response is one from anyone who believes in changing conventions for sensible reasons.", "The second is someone who knows that changing conventions is costly and leads to a period of confusion, often not worth the gain from fixing a small problem.", "The title of this article references the biggest small problem \u2014 and it is a small problem \u2014 likely to account for errors and misrepresentations of only a few percent.", "There are obviously better methods, and many use them, but almost all have extra cost.", "Both of these are completely legitimate and widely used methods \u2014 but they are time and thought intensive.", "The reason the pragmatic convention of 16\u201350\u201384 has continued to exist is that it is easy, quick and understandable. It\u2019s simple to explain what you have done and how you have done it.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with pragmatic short-cut conventions, in fact I think that they generally pay more dividends (in saved time and mental energy) than they cost in accuracy.", "So what if I told you that there was a method equally simple (at least in terms of computational complexity) that will work on any dataset and gives results that well represent the form of a much wider array of data?", "What if I tried to propose a new minimum standard of result reporting?", "The split normal is one of the easier answers in a pub-quiz round about obscure statistical distributions. It is oft discovered, rediscovered and forgotten*. It\u2019s what you\u2019d get if you took two different normal distributions (each with their own standard deviation), cut them in half and stitched them back together wrong.", "*including by me, until I found a great document detailing all the other people who claimed discovery", "The reason it\u2019s discovered is that it gives a useful easy way to describe an assymetric distribution. In three numbers it maps out the mode* of the data \u2014 it\u2019s peak \u2014 and the rate at which the data falls off either side of this mode. The three numbers are immediately tangible (unlike the skewness) and actually give meaningful results (unlike 16\u201350\u201384).", "*remember when you were taught about that in school, applied it to a question about shoe sizes and never heard of it again", "The reason it\u2019s forgotten is that it\u2019s only slightly useful \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of other distributions that fit similarly well and some even have a few more enviable properties (whilst the normal normal and log normal distribution occur relatively commonly in nature, the split normal is inherently artificial and whilst it may describe data well it will never be \u201cperfect\u201d)", "However, I\u2019m here to give you a BRAND NEW advantage that I think makes the split normal a viable replacement as the minimum pragmatic standard of result reporting \u2014 I found a way to make it directly calculable.", "By directly calculable I mean that you can fit a split normal to your data by only doing a small number of basic mathematical operations (like the mean, which just requires addition, or the median where you only need to sort the data) unlike methods where you have to fit the data by trying a bunch of different models and finding the best one (like a maximum likelihood estimation).", "I\u2019m going to leave a full description of how it\u2019s done to a dryer source \u2014 a paper I\u2019ve written up on the subject.", "This means that finding the split normal parameters is as easy as, and much more representative than, the 16\u201350\u201384th percentile values.", "So what do we do about it? Well, my advice is to start using it :) Follow that link and you\u2019ll find a (very basic) python script* that can model it, fit it and randomly sample from it.", "*if anyone reading knows how to get such a thing into a numpy (or scipy library) that would seem a natural place for it.", "Using the split normal is always pretty good. It\u2019s not the most elegant or accurate solution, but it\u2019s never not going to work.", "This is all about lowering the bar for access to better tools, to simplify and streamline how people handle data rather than complicate. I don\u2019t know if it will ever be taken up \u2014 or if a better standard still can be suggested \u2014 but I do hope this will help dissuade others fro a 16\u201350\u201384 approach hereafter.", "I would advise anyone interested to just start putting these values into their work instead of the 16\u201350\u201384 method. Two competing standards just makes things more complex and this is about making the world a little bit simpler (and more accurate).", "If you do this, but do want to signpost that you\u2019ve treated your data a little differently, how about quoting your values like this?:", "Perhaps I have you convinced, perhaps not. There is no one right way for everyone to do anything. I was shocked at the number of people that I thought were doing it a wrong way \u2014 but that\u2019s a very subjective view and even then I rarely believe it invalidates their work or conclusions \u2014 it\u2019s just an unfortunate, common and hopefully fixable problem.", "A stitch in time saves nine, as the old saying goes. This stitch is coming a little late \u2014 maybe only saving three or four. But, any small saving of time or accuracy, when played out over the worldwide population of people making, reading and using statistics will save lifetimes.", "Play about with the concept and the tools.
