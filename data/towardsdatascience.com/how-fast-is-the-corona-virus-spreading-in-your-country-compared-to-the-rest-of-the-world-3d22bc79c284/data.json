If not, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.", "IMPORTANT: Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, please familiarize yourself with these 10 considerations before you create another chart about COVID-19 by Tableau.", "You can access this data via various channels. The quickest and easiest way for me was via the GitHub app and then connect to the John Hopkins GitHub repository.", "You can explore other ways at the Tableau Covid-10 Data Hub page. For instance via a *.Hyper, *.CSV file, Web Data Connector, Google Sheet and others. Step-by-Step instructions for all data sources can be found here.", "Another quick and dirty way is to open the John Hopkins daily reports repo and directly to download several CSV files from there. For the purpose of this tutorial, this is also absolutely enough.", "In case you have established a direct connection to a Data Source, you can skip this step. Once we have all of the files needed, we can import them in Tableau. In order to do so:", "Once we have all of the CSV files available in Tableau, then we can proceed with merging/combining the files into a dedicated Tableau Data Source. In other words we merge all rows from all files into one file. In Tableau this operation is called a Union, which is absolutely identical to UNION ALL with SQL. Usually, this operation is performed when we know that all of the columns from the files have the same names/structure.", "The first thing we need to do know is to familiarize ourselves with the dataset. You can see a sample of the data with the respective columns in the table overview pane at the Data Source tab.", "What is worth noticing are two particular fields where you can see date data:", "In order to create a date field based on the text field Path, we need to use the function Create Calculated Field, using the following calculation:", "Now, having a date field is great and it is time to create our anchor point. Since we want to compare different countries it makes sense to create a common starting point for each one of them. In our case, we will use the 100th registered case at any row from the data set as a starting point.", "At this step, we just do a simple grouping of some different naming convention of a couple countries, e.g.", "China (China; Mainland of China), Iran (Iran; Islamic Republic of Iran), South Korea (South Korea; Korea, South), United Kingdom (UK; United Kingdom) ,United States (US; United States) etc.", "On the abscissa, we would like to display the days since the 100th registered case in each country. In order to do that, I used the following calculation:", "Here, we take the minimum date in the dataset for each country, which is actually the date of the 100th case (since we filtered already for this). Then we estimate the difference between this date and the day represented at this row level. I have named this field: days_passed", "NOTE: Be sure to create this field as a Dimension, NOT as a Measure.", "One measure, that is extremely useful to have is the number of active cases. We can easily get this using the following calculate and name the measure Active cases:", "We use the ZN() function to be on the safe side in case there any null values in the dataset.", "And now is time for the fun part.", "Now, you can play around by adding labels, tooltips, additional filters, etc.", "If you found this article useful, you disagree with some of the points, have questions or suggestions, please don\u2019t hesitate to leave me a comment below.
