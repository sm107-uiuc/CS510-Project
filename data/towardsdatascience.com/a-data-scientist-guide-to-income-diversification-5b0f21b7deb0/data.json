Not utilizing every bit of knowledge won\u2019t get you too far, and 9 to 5 isn\u2019t as safe as it once was. So, what can you do? Diversify.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution. You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "It\u2019s hard to get a job in data science in the first place. And it shouldn\u2019t be an end goal, at least for Millenials and anyone younger (like myself), because:", "But even if we did, relying on a single source of income is not the best thing one can do \u2014 not with a data scientist\u2019s skillset at least.", "Ask yourself the following: If I were to lose my job now, for how long would the money keep coming? Until the 1st of the next month? Or the 10th? Anyway, you get the gist. You earn as long as you work.", "That idea doesn\u2019t get me excited at all. That\u2019s why a year ago, I decided to diversify my income streams, and now I have 5 of them.", "How was that possible? Below you\u2019ll find five sections, each describing a single income source and how I\u2019m maintaining it. You\u2019ll be able to the same as long as:", "Also, above-average intelligence is not required. A regular Joe willing to work hard beats talented lazy-ass know-it-all every time.", "Let\u2019s begin with the income source number one.", "I guess this one was a no-brainer for most of you. I said a regular job isn\u2019t that safe anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should quit it. At least in the beginning. Let me elaborate.", "There\u2019s no point in ditching your only income source to work on the other ones if you\u2019re starting out. Some excitement about personal projects is great, but more often than not, it pays precisely $0, or it even takes some money out of the pocket. You can\u2019t afford that lifestyle just yet, but it\u2019s just a matter of time.", "9 to 5 will get you relevant working experience. You\u2019ll never put yourself that much outside of the comfort zone as a new, enterprise-level data science project you\u2019re working will. And that\u2019s essential to get better at things.", "Let me repeat myself once again \u2014 9 to 5 shouldn\u2019t be an end goal to anyone wanting to build multiple income streams. No matter if the job is at Google or Microsoft, or the salary is $500K. This income stream stops as soon as you stop working (it\u2019s active income in other terms).", "This one also shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise. If you have some spare time and don\u2019t mind sparing it on work, it can\u2019t hurt to try freelancing or providing some other B2B service. You\u2019d be surprised how much you can earn for only a couple of hours a week.", "The possibilities are endless \u2014 from freelancing on sites like UpWork to starting your own business and scaling it through the years \u2014 it depends on your aspirations and the amount of time you can put in. Once again, your skillset as a data scientist is wide, so you can apply for more postings then frontend developers, for example.", "If there\u2019s one thing harder than getting a job without experience, it is getting your first freelance client, at least if your name is entirely unknown. So prepare yourself for a month(s) of rejection. It\u2019s just a temporary thing.", "This one is my favorite by far. It\u2019s a precious tool for any data scientist, because:", "Check out this article if you want to learn more about blogging as a data scientist (or tech professional):", "Honestly, this should be a no-brainer if you want to take yourself and your income to the next level. A great place to start is Medium, of course, but you can also choose to host your content. The first option is free and will show results quicker, but the ladder is better if you want 100% content control.", "Every so often, I read a book or watch a course that\u2019s just better than the others. There\u2019s no reason not to share it with my audience if I find it beneficial. Also, this income stream comes naturally with blogging, as there\u2019s no reason not to make any product link an affiliate one.", "If you are unsure of what an affiliate link is, continue reading. Essentially, it\u2019s a referral link, which means you\u2019ll make a small commission from any purchase that came through your link. Price for the end-user stays the same, or is even reduced in some cases.", "I do this a lot with tech books that have helped me become better at what I do. See the following article to get an idea:", "If you don\u2019t have time to read it, here\u2019s my thought process on affiliate content:", "It\u2019s a straightforward strategy that earns a couple of hundred bucks every month for no additional effort \u2014 because I would write book/course reviews anyway.", "Amazon and Udemy have great affiliate programs.", "Sometimes I have a content idea that can\u2019t into a single blog post because it would be a 45-minute read. No one wants that. So, why not make a short eBook out of it?", "I\u2019m only a week or so in this income stream, but there are already a couple of purchases for my Time Series Forecasting with Python and XGBoost eBook.", "And it\u2019s incredibly easy to get started. The most challenging part is to, well, write and edit the book. Publishing is easy. Let\u2019s discuss two options:", "I can\u2019t tell you exactly how profitable this income stream will be down the road, but it\u2019s a great way to put your name out there and earn a couple of bucks.", "And there you have it \u2014 exactly how to go from one to five income sources. There\u2019s a lot of technicalities not mentioned here because, again, it would be a 45-minute read, but I hope you get the gist and will explore further on your own.", "Feel free to get in touch with any questions.
