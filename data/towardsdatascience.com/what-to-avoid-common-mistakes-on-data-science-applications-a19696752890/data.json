This is especially true for those with little to no experience in industry (fresh graduate of a data science Msc etc.).", "This is a huge shame as I (personally) genuinely want everyone to do their best and get the jobs they want, but I do feel bad when I can\u2019t find strong reasons to get them onto the next rung of the recruitment process. I would imagine this holds true for many other people in my position as well. They want you to succeed but we need to know you can before we invest time for an interview. Oddly they aren\u2019t cost free to the business, if you consider you\u2019ll be meeting 2\u20133 people for an hour each this can quickly add up in lost productivity.", "To put a finger on this costs we can make an order of magnitude estimate. A senior data scientist is \u00a3 60,805 a year (\u00a3 31/hour) with a data scientist generally commanding \u00a3 46,820 a year (\u00a3 24/hour). If you consider the senior data scientist will probably have a total of an hours\u2019 worth of phone conversations with you (or about you to a recruiter) and if you pass that you will then have an interview for an hour with two people (a team data scientist performing technical interviewing and the senior doing some softer skills and fit interviews) followed by a 30 minute private group discussion afterwards about the result of the interview. They have then made an investment of 4 hours or around \u00a3 114 in salary costs in you. However, this is a minimum cost because you would need to factor in additional hours or other factors such as HR personnel etc.", "So, an interview is an expensive investment in gauging you, making it important everyone does the best they can.", "Following on from my own lessons on survivorship bias, instead of listing what a successful applicant did right, I\u2019ve listed the mistakes of those that never got very far in the process. My hope is that this will help you avoid the common mistakes I see in over half of every application I get across my desk.", "I\u2019ll expand on each, but the general list is:", "Note: These are based on my own personal experiences and views combined with talking to others about their interview experiences. Different people and/or companies may have different experiences/opinions.", "This may seem obvious, but I do see this, and it is an instant \u201cno no\u201d. Luckily, I rarely see blatant lying, but I have seen the case where someone claimed to have headed up a group, only to find the interviewer actually knows the head of that group and confronted them on this mid interview.", "Trust is a great commodity as you\u2019ll be expected to convey an image of integrity and professionalism when representing the company. Therefore, you don\u2019t want to do anything to make them doubt you can do that. So, what I mean by \u201cdo not lie\u201d here is an attempt to distort or disguise something your presenting about yourself to an extent that you are seen to be untrustworthy.", "This \u201ctruth stretching\" covers things like:", "Taking credit is often seen where a MOOC or other course is passed off as original work, maybe even suggesting it was a real data science project for industry. Rather than capstone courses (i.e. you are given data and little guidance on the solution) these are the ones where you are following structured course material and the solutions are readily available.", "The flaw in presenting them in this way is that any reasonably sized data science group will probably have had someone who has already taken it and therefore will notice the similarities in what you are talking about. They can generally weed these out and while not an outright no, it might be dimly viewed depending on how bad the faux pas was. The same is true for smaller groups as they often still possess that core nucleus of highly experienced data scientists (some of whom may have written the courses you are quoting).", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I would expect anyone to make the best and most impressive case about themselves (e.g. bigging yourself up) and a show of confidence is good, but you can go too far.", "If you list under \u201cWork/Industrial/Professional Experience\u201d a Kaggle, Coursera or edX course it will get a raised eyebrow. While all of those are great continued education and professional development, they rarely compare to the unique challenges of having a paying client or boss giving you a genuine problem to solve. The latter work is more impressive, but the former is good too. Just put it in the right place.", "The most common areas of bullet point three (something that cannot have happened) are claims which lack basic fact checking. I.e. If you make a claim of 10 years of TensorFlow experience (released in 2015), don\u2019t expect that to go down well. Also, if you say you have extreme attention to detail, make sure you do not have glaring formatting errors.", "Any of these claims may get pointed out and you will feel embarrassed. Or you could argue you are in the right (as has happened), but if you cannot prove it then this will not work in your favour (see point three below).", "Imagine you have just read a book and it never once mentioned anything to do with science fiction, despite you buying it from that section of the store. You read it all the way to the end hoping it would suddenly appear.", "Now imagine reading a CV back to front and getting to the end to find it didn\u2019t mention data science or machine learning once. How can you judge their skills?", "If you want a data science job you need to mention it and go into details. I have seen many CV\u2019s which go on for pages about things they have done but make no mention of machine learning algorithms, statistics or even python/R etc.", "To be hired an interviewer needs to see that you know something about the subject area, and they need enough detail to know what experience level you are so you can be interviewed appropriately. For example, there is no point testing you on SQL if you have never used it. They could instead be testing you on a stronger area you have mentioned (it takes many kinds to build a good data science capability).", "If you state \u201cI used machine learning\u201d tell me more. Make it a short but interesting story. For example:", "\u201cWe utilised a machine learning solution to detect drain leaks by first applying PCA on Fourier transformed sound profiles. A final classification was given using a K-nearest neighbours.\u201d", "\u201cWe had a problem with leaking drains. Using machine learning we were able to detect them.\u201d", "The above solution is a little longer in length, but you have mentioned two things that will peak my interest and those are \u201chow you did it\u201d and \u201cdomain knowledge\u201d. It helps to distinguish you as someone who knows how it works, and can design bespoke solutions, from someone who used an off the shelf program that you click and forget (e.g. it runs multiple models and selects the best with no expert oversight).", "On the relevancy, make sure areas that are not relevant to data scientist are further down your CV. I was often taught to tailor my CV for every job I applied for and this would entail moving sections up that are more relevant, so they are seen first. If a potential boss is reading lots of CV\u2019s a day, they will be short on attention, you will need to grab them early on. It also shows you possess one of the data science key skills which is to convey the key point of your findings clearly and quickly.", "If you have a covering letter or statement, make it relevant. They perhaps only need to know you have 12 Aunts and have not eaten meat for 2 years as part of the ice breaking conversations at the start of your face to face interview.", "With the huge explosion in data science, there is a temptation to put down all the buzzwords you can remember and hope those catch someone\u2019s eye.", "Since it is such a diverse field, putting down a lot of stuff will cast a large net but will cause raised eyebrows on whether you really are the magical unicorn of data science. If you are not, then you may struggle when queried and possibly alienate the interviewer (remember about stretching the truth?).", "This is because interviewers have a habit that once they find a chink in your knowledge, they will chip at it and see how deep the void goes. This means you can spend 15\u201320 minutes of your interview being grilled on something you know little about, become super disheartened, feel embarrassed and the areas you are super strong at never get a look in.", "The way to avoid this is to only ever write things on your CV that you feel you can defend if asked questions on.", "I have certainly had the case where during a technical interview someone has struggled to do a SQL question I\u2019ve set. However, when they stated it wasn\u2019t something they normally do, I\u2019ve pointed out the part of their application where they wrote it was. This is awkward for everyone and casts doubts on other areas of your CV that may in fact be solid.", "Interviews are scary and believe it or not the interviewer is worried how it will go too (or at least I am). They want you to succeed and be the best data scientist you can because no one wants to sit through interviews for people who clearly cannot do the job.", "If you get an interview you have clearly shown, you have enough promise to incur the cost to the business of setting up an interview.", "To help you do the best these tips can help you:", "In summary if you can write down how amazing you are and what experience you have in the field in a nicely digestible form then you are well on your way to demonstrating you can convey critical information well!", "P.S. Also don\u2019t be afraid to ask for feedback. You may not receive any and don\u2019t be disheartened by that but any you do get is a precious commodity that\u2019ll help pinpoint any weak areas.", "Your home for data science.
