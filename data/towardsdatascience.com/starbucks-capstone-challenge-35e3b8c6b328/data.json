In this project, the given dataset contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this dataset.", "The goal of this project is to combine transaction, demographic, and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This dataset is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks sells dozens of products.", "This goal can be achieved by following the below-mentioned strategies:", "The data is contained in three files:", "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:", "To evaluate our model\u2019s performance, we will use accuracy. This Metric was chosen for the following reasons :", "The Exploration of the Portfolio Dataset showed the following:", "The Exploration and Visualization for the Profile Dataset showed the following:", "Exploring and visualizing \u2018gender\u2019, \u2019income\u2019 and \u2019age\u2019 variables", "The missing values in \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018income\u2019 variables which are related solely and specifically with the 2175 customers registered at age 118. In other words, customers at age 118 have no registered \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018income\u2019. This needs to be cleaned in the Data Pre-processing Section.", "According to the available data, There are three \u2018gender\u2019 categories into which the customers fall in ( M, F, and O). Keeping in our mind the above observation that there are 2175 missing values, Male Customers (8484 men) are more than Female Customers(6129 women) with 57% of customers are Males compared to 41% Females. However, there are 212 customers chose \u201cO\u201d as their gender.", "The Exploration for the Transcript Dataset showed the following:", "1. Rename \u2018time\u2019 column to \u2018time_h\u2019 representing that the unit of measurement is \u2018hours\u2019.", "This quick analysis of the master datagrams includes some questions such as:", "The most common offer type among all age groups is the BOGO, followed by the Discount Offers. Whereas, the least common offer to be sent is the informational offers. I believe that BOGO offers are more attractive compared to other offers provided by Starbucks.", "Males and Females are pretty close when it comes to the time spent to complete an offer. Both males and females take about 17 days to do so.", "2017 was the best year for Starbucks in terms of the number of new members. Around 38% of all the customers on our dataset registered as members of this specific year.", "The chart we got showed that both genders like BOGO and Discount offer and they have the same reaction toward Informational offers, they both seem to be not interested in it.", "The mean time it takes a customer to complete an offer is less than 16 days (372 hours).", "In this part, I tried to make a model that can predict whether a customer will ONLY VIEW an offer or will VIEW & COMPLETE the offer. Since this model is focusing on the events of \u2018Offer View\u2019 and \u2018Offer Completed\u2019, I will only consider those transcripts with the event \u2018Offer View\u2019 or \u2018Offer Completed\u2019. In other words, I will not include transcripts with event \u2018Transaction\u2019 or \u2018Offer Received\u2019 in my Training and Testing Sets.", "When it comes to Features, I am going to consider ONLY those features that I believe are important for our model to predict Target accurately.", "The Target (Label) is: \u2018event\u2019 that will hold numerical values either:", "Here is how the features data frame looks like before modeling:", "The shape of my features and labels was:", "For the Modeling part, I tried six different models the results were as follows:", "The above table shows the accuracy score related to using different models of supervised learning. As presented on the table, we had 100% accuracy in both training and testing sets for 4 models ( out of 6). To avoid overfitting as much as possible, I will choose the model that gave me the lowest accuracy score on the testing set, which is the KNeighborsClassifier. On this model, I got 99.88% on the testing set. I know that this is a very high score, but I chose this model because I believe that it can be used on a to solve a Binary outcome problem statement: On whether the customer will view the offer ( JUST VIEW) or he will (complete the offer), i.e. VIEW & COMPLETE that specific offer.", "Through this project, I tried to analyze the datasets provided by Starbucks and then built a model that can predict whether a customer would complete the offer or just view it?", "First, I have explored each dataset, visualize it to get an overall understanding of the data. This also included analyzing different aspects of the datasets. Then, I moved to the Preprocessing Part. Preprocessing Data was the task that took most of the time and effort. The dataset is a bit tricky and the data included required me to use my wrangling/ engineering and preprocessing skills to get the final clean version of the three datasets. The next step was to create some latent features that can improve the performance of the model. These featured were derived from the original existing column but with less range of values and simple values to include within the dataset. Examples of that are the following:", "Although I believe in the saying \u201c There is always a room for Improvement\u201d, But I think that the KNeighborsClassifier model is giving me a high score. Trying to improve such a model will surely cause us to get into the fault of Overfitting. So, I will not suggest any improvement on this model since I believe that we don\u2019t need to try to get better results.", "It is worth nothing saying that I was planning to use the GridSearchCV to improve that model that I will choose. That was my plan, before getting hit by the Very High scores.", "I believe I got to a point where I had very good results when it comes to the prediction model. I understood the data provided by Starbucks very well.", "As there is always space for improvement, I believe that the idea of improving the data collection or fixing issues related to the missing data or NaNs would be really helpful. I think that we can get great insights from this dataset and great prediction models might be also built to solve problems statements associated with this dataset. Examples for these model are the following :", "I enjoyed working on this capstone project which allowed me to polish my skills in Data Preprocessing and Modeling. The most difficult part in my opinion was deciding on the problem statement. This is because a weak problem statement would surely cause the other work to be under-appreciated and valued.", "The Preprocessing Step was the longest and most challenging part to complete. The Dataset itself is inspiring.
