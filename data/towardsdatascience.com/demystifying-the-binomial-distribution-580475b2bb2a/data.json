A Bernoulli trial is a term that is used in probability theory and statistics. It is a trial (an experiment) which is random and have two possible outcomes. These two outcomes can be either a \u2018success\u2019 or a \u2018failure\u2019. The best way to understand this is through examples. I list three examples that can be related to field of epidemiology (viral antibody test), machine learning (binary classification prediction) and general probability theory (coin toss).", "You are probably now getting the feeling that a Bernoulli trial happens very often in practical scenarios which is true. This is why Bernoulli trial and its related probability distributions like binomial distribution have a lot of applications in practice.", "Okay, for those uninformed, it would make sense to touch upon the intuition behind probability distribution. In simple terms, probability distribution is the distribution of possible values of a random variable. It is always represented by a graph which is essentially nothing but a histogram with the x-axis representing the values of the random variable and the y-axis representing the probability that of the random variable taking the corresponding variable.", "Now one possible question here would be what is a random variable? A random variable is a variable that can take or store values from a random experiment. Usually, random variables are represented by an alphabet in block letters, (eg:- X).", "Probability distributions enable us to make inferences about scientific experiments from sample data. The ultimate goal of a scientific experiment is to test some hypothesis and make inferences if the hypothesis is true or not using sample data. A sample is only a small representative of the whole population (population is the set of all possible outcomes in the world) and it is not practical at all to get data of the population. Rather, we take samples and using samples we extrapolate the findings from sample to population. This extrapolation is almost always done by using probability distributions. So probability distributions are one of the most widely used concepts in statistics that has applications in literally almost every scientific fields. In general, there are two types of probability distributions depending on the type of random variable that generates these distributions. These are discrete probability distributions and continuous probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables respectively. I am not going into the details of discrete and continuous random variables, but binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution because the binomial random variable is a discrete variable (i.e., it can only take integers) whereas the popular normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution.", "As the name suggests, Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of a Bernoulli trial. It is the simplest of all probability distributions because it\u2019s a single trial, has only two outcomes and we just need to know the probability of getting each outcome. Remember, the probability of \u2018failure\u2019 in a Bernoulli trial is the compliment of the probability of \u2018success\u2019 as these are two mutually exclusive events and only one of them can occur from one trial/experiment. In a coin toss, for example, if we suppose that the coin is fair, then probability of obtaining a head is 0.5 and equivalently the probability of obtaining a tail is 1- 0.5 = 0.5.", "Let\u2019s define a random variable X which takes the value of the number of successes (let\u2019s say getting the head is success) of a single coin toss, a Bernoulli trial. Here, X can only have two possible values \u2014 0 and 1. That is you either get a head or you get a tail. If the coin is fair, probability of both success and failure is 0.5. Similarly, if the coin is not fair, the probability of success might not be 0.5. Instead, it might be 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.2 \u2014 can be anything. The Bernoulli probability distribution is thus depending on the probability of success, usually represented by the letter p, where p is a value between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1. The only parameter that the Bernoulli distribution is dependent upon is p.", "Bernoulli trial is always a single trial. What if we do multiple Bernoulli trials as part of a single experiment? Like, \u2019n\u2019 number of times? As an example from field of epidemiology, don\u2019t you think that testing a random set of 1000 subjects for COVID-19 sounds something very similar? Yes, it is. We will not go through the COVID-19 part now, but this was just to ring a bell that binomial experiments are very commonly found in practical scenarios.", "Let\u2019s define a random variable X that represents the number of successes of these n trials/experiments? If a Bernoulli trial is repeated n number of times, then the experiment as a whole is known as a Binomial experiment. Here, each individual trial/experiment is a Bernoulli trial. But unlike the X in our previous Bernoulli example, here X represents the number of successes in a binomial experiment, which is constituted by n Bernoulli trials. Let\u2019s start with an example, the best way to start learning anything new. We can consider the coin toss example. Instead of a single toss that we talked about earlier during Bernoulli trial, we toss the coin 3 times. So the n here is 3.Our X is the number of successes in the whole Binomial experiment. Here, n is 5 and each of them can have 2 outcomes (head or tail) and hence we have a set of 2\u00b3 = 8 possible outcomes instead just 2 in case of a Bernoulli trial.", "These 8 outcomes are: {H,H,H}, {H,H,T}, {H,T,H}, {H,T,T}, {T,H,H}, {T,H,T}, {T,T,H}, {T,T,T} where H represents heads and T represents tails. Our X is a binomial random variable meaning it represents the number of successes in n trials. So it can take 0, 1, 2 or 3. Now, we would like to construct a binomial distribution for the random variable X. This means that we need to compute the probabilities for each possible values of X. Let\u2019s start with the scenario when the X = 2, i.e, probability of observing exactly 2 heads in 3 tosses. Let\u2019s define p, the probability of success (getting a head) of each individual toss (a Bernoulli trial) is equal to 0.4 (coin is not so fair!).", "The two heads can occur in: HHT, HTH and THH. The probability of getting a head in a single trial, which is p, is 0.4. The sequence HHT has thus a probability of 0.4 * 0.4*0.6. For all three plausible scenarios where two heads can occur, the probability of each individual sequence is:", "You can see a pattern that regardless of the order of H and T, the probability of getting any one of the sequences are all identical and it is always equal to 0.4\u00b2 * 0.6. Since we have three plausible sequences, we can just multiply (0.4\u00b2*0.6) by three to get the probability of getting exactly two heads in three trials. Even this number \u20183\u2019 here can actually easily computed by using permutations and combinations. The question here how many different times you can pick two items from a sample of 3. This is nothing but the popular nCr questions where n is 3 and r is 2. In this example, 3C2 is nothing but 3!", "Now we can also represent the probability of obtaining exactly two heads in three tosses in the following expression:", "Note that if you sum all the four probabilities above, it will equate to 1.", "In general, the probability of obtaining k successes in n fixed and independent Bernoulli trials, the binomial probability, can be written as the following:", "The above function is also known as the probability mass function (PMF) for binomial distribution. For any discrete distributions, there will be a PMF associated with it and for binomial distribution the PMF just happens to be the above function.", "If you look at the above formula for PMF of the binomial distribution, you can see that if n is 1, the equation simply becomes the PMF of Bernoulli distribution.", "Coming back to our earlier example of coin toss, we now have probabilities computed for all possible successes possible in 3 trials. So let\u2019s construct the probability distribution for the binomial experiment where n is 3 and p is 0.4.", "In general, a binomial distribution depends on two parameters. These are n and p. Remember that Bernoulli distribution is dependent only on p because n is always 1 in Bernoulli trial. A random variable X, if it follows a binomial distribution is thus represented by the following notation mathematically", "It is also important to note the conditions that are required for an experiment to satisfy if that experiment is a binomial experiment. These conditions are:", "All conditions are to be satisfied if the experiment has to be a binomial experiment. But there are scenarios where condition no. 3 and more commonly condition no. 4 are violated. For example, if you are doing sampling without replacement (i.e., you remove your picked samples after each individual trial), the p does not remain same and the trials are not independent of each other. However, this is not usually a problem with large sample sizes and non-extreme values of p.", "This is assuming that you are somewhat familiar with the normal distribution, the mother of all probability distributions. So what has binomial distribution got to do with normal distribution?", "Let\u2019s look at some binomial distribution plots with varying values of n with p as 0.5.", "Let\u2019s look at binomial distributions when the probability of each trial is a little bit on the extreme, say 0.1", "In both the cases, you can see that the binomial distribution looks more or less like a bell curve like in normal distribution! This is especially true when p is 0.5. This property is known as the approximation to normal distribution. This is an incredibly useful phenomenon because by this approximation you can derive inferences about population from your sample data. Note that the normal approximation is not quite true for extreme values of p. In the second example where p is 0.1 you can see that the distribution is a bit skewed and not as symmetrical as it is when p is 0.5. Nonetheless, the normal approximation works well in most scenarios and there are some methods (like continuity correction) to adjust for the deviation from normal approximation when dealing with binomial proportions like prevalence of a disease.", "I am not a fan of the use of cheat sheets in biostatistics because they can lead to bad practices and can mislead those who are looking for an easy way out. Always remember that there is no free lunch in statistics. Having said that, it is still sometimes useful to have some sort of a cheat sheet for practical purposes provided you always take it with a pinch of salt. For example, in binomial distribution, you can say that the normal approximation works well in cases when the minimum of n*p and n*(1-p) is more than or equal to 5.", "The normal approximation of binomial distribution is very much related to the Central Limit Theorem in statistics and this phenomenon is also known as De Moivre \u2014 Laplace theorem", "For those who want to know a bit more about the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), there are tons of materials out there. I have also developed an interactive RShiny dashboard that illustrates the concept of CLT.", "The two plots above also illustrate a remarkable phenomenon in binomial distribution. If you look carefully, you can see that the maximum probability is occurring at a point when X = n*p. For example, in the second series, when n is 30 (p is fixed here at 0.1), n*p yields 3. You can see that the height of the bar is highest at 3 here. This will be seen in all the plots regardless of your n or p. This value is nothing but the expected value of X, usually represented by E(X). You can think of it like an average value or the mean value for practical purposes. The probability is highest when X is actually equal to or near E(X). This means that if your sample size is not very small, a random unbiased sample is most likely to contain number of successes equal to the E(X) because that\u2019s where the probability is highest.", "A random unbiased sample with sufficient sample size from the population is more likely to contain number of successes that are equal to or near the actual number of successes in a population.", "By definition, expected value of a random variable is the weighted sum of the individual values of X by its corresponding probabilities. In this context of probability distributions, the expected value and mean can be considered to be essentially the same.", "The above two equations for mean and variance can be used to construct a new random variable that follows a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 (because of the normal approximation property) by subtracting each value of X with its mean and then dividing it by its standard deviation. Now, this new variable can be assumed to follow a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This enables us to construct test-statistics (see my earlier publication \u2018Demystifying the p-value for details) and thus p-values thereby equipping us to conduct hypothesis tests. I am not going into the details. My objective here is to make the concept and intuition clear.", "I believe now it makes sense to illustrate one very common application of binomial distribution in epidemiology.", "For example, let\u2019s say the actual prevalence of COVID-19 in your country is about 1%. This value is actually unknown (we don\u2019t know the true prevalence!), so usually what epidemiologists do is conduct sero-prevalence studies in a random sample. Why? Because it\u2019s utmost important to get an idea about the actual prevalence of the disease to guide important policy decisions.", "But it is not practical to conduct this study on the entire population, so they would rather select a random sample of size let\u2019s say 1000. So a subject is drawn randomly from the population and is tested for COVID-19. This process can be considered to be a Bernoulli trial! Now when you do this for 1000 subjects, it becomes a binomial experiment! The number of successes here would be nothing but the number of subjects who tested positive for COVID. You can argue that here the trials are not independent, because once a subject got tested, he is not \u2018replaced\u2019 and hence this is not a sampling with replacement. Because this is not a sampling with replacement, the probability of getting tested positive is not same for each subjects. Then again, as mentioned before, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about this unless your sample size is too small.", "Now, here is the catch. If your study is an ideal one with no bias and your sample of 1000 subjects are true representatives of the entire population, then the most likely scenario is that the number of subjects who would test positive in this sample is around 10 (n*p = 1000 * 1%= 10) because of the property described earlier. This means that from your sample, your estimate of true prevalence (population prevalence) is 10 divided by 1000 which is 1% which in turn is the actual prevalence! Now, in practical scenarios, you probably wouldn\u2019t get exactly 1%, but the chances are that you would still get a value that\u2019s closer to the true value. This is where the confidence intervals and p-values comes which in most cases is estimated from the property of normal approximation.", "There are many more nuances to estimating the true prevalence of a disease. What I have discussed above is just the bare-minimum basic. As discussed earlier, if the true prevalence is actually close to 0 (this is not uncommon) or 1, then normal approximation might not work as intended. There are alternative methods to tackle this issue, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion. Also, your diagnostic/screening test is never perfect. There can be false positives and false negatives. There are methods to tackle this also by adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity when estimating prevalence (keyword: Rogan Gladen estimator). It is important to know these caveats when conducting a study and also whilst reading sero-prevalence journal publications.", "The most common use-case in machine learning or AI is a binary classification problem. That is, you want to train and validate an algorithm that predicts whether or not the particular observation belongs to one class or not (0 or 1 scenarios). The most basic algorithm used to do this is a logistic regression model. For example, you want to predict, given an image of an animal, whether it is a dog or not. Here, the algorithm finally outputs a probability value such that it is the probability that the animal in the image is dog given the input characteristics (pixel values of image). Another example would be you want to predict the risk for a hospital readmission within 30-days following the discharge. The \u2018risk\u2019 here is nothing but the probability of getting re-admitted within 30 days given the patient characteristics (demographics, medical history, biochemical profile, etc.).", "In all these cases, the dependent variable (aka target variable, response variable) is a binary variable which can take either 0 or 1. This variable actually follows a Bernoulli distribution (which is nothing but the binomial distribution when n is 1) and the objective of a logistic regression model is to estimate the \u2018p\u2019 of success given the input characteristics.", "Your home for data science.
