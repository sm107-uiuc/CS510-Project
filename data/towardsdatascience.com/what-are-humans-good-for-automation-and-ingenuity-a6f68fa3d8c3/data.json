Considering automated processes as collaborators with humans, not merely as simple replacements, opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for both humans and algorithms.", "Around the same time, Alteryx hosted its first Twitter chat, addressing topics like the democratization of data and upskilling for the data professions. Question 5 in the chat connected neatly with these issues around automation, the role of AI and how people and algorithms can work together:", "There\u2019s a lot to talk about here! Let\u2019s cover the essentials \u2705, go for a drive \ud83d\ude97 and get a little philosophical \ud83e\udd14.", "Everyone in the chat was rightly excited about the potential of automation to take over the dull bits of everyday work:", "There\u2019s another perk of changing error-prone humans\u2019 role:", "We humans have fancy brains capable of complex reasoning, but we still make mistakes. Tedious tasks can become so mind-numbing that bored humans start to blunder. Fortunately, algorithms don\u2019t get fatigued; they continue cleaning, classifying and predicting as requested, row after row.", "Automation frees human brain power to focus on the tasks where it\u2019s best applied:", "But here\u2019s an interesting dilemma: Are certain kinds of human involvement beneficial to everyone involved in the application of a predictive algorithm?", "Imagine this (only slightly) futuristic scenario. You\u2019re behind the steering wheel of a self-driving car. The car is on \u201cautopilot\u201d and is driving you on a familiar route. You\u2019re supposed to stay alert as the car drives, but there\u2019s also that email on your phone that you really need to answer. You pick up your phone and start writing, ignoring what the car is doing. Automation frees you from driving (a usually dull, non-intellectual task) so you can focus on a more human-appropriate task that involves critical thinking and language skills currently beyond AI\u2019s capabilities. Automated driving may also reduce accidents, given that 94% of serious crashes are said to be caused by human error.", "But automated driving technology isn\u2019t yet perfected or common. There\u2019s still a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d of driving decision-making who has critical thinking abilities.", "Someday, however, we\u2019ll have widespread, skilled automated driving technology. When mundane tasks like driving get automated, what\u2019s the incentive for engagement by the human who is watching from the sidelines? Why not write that email instead of watching the road?", "As AI can handle more and more complex tasks, humans will still be, well, human. We still need to feel valued so that we are motivated to engage in automated processes\u2019 outcomes. If we could build a perfect self-driving car and ensure always-ideal driving conditions, there would be zero incentive for a human to watch the road.", "Similarly, if we could use AI to perfectly select applicants for mortgage loans, or the ideal placement of ads in various media to generate leads, or the location of new retail stores \u2014 why would the humans related to these processes expend additional time researching the applicants, media or locations thoroughly?", "Humans might be tempted to just say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure the AI got it right.\u201d We could lose the important nuances and advanced critical thinking that humans bring to those processes.", "Researchers have been exploring this delicate balance. They\u2019re considering whether, when and how to maintain humans\u2019 role in processes and decisions that, in theory, could become perfectly automated, but that would still benefit from human collaboration.", "A recent paper, \u201cThe Allocation of Decision Authority to Human and Artificial Intelligence,\u201d takes a hard look at what humans and AI both bring to the table in decision-making processes:", "\u2026 we consider a principal [an organizational leader] who faces a choice as to whether to give a human agent or an AI authority in making a decision. How does the introduction of the AI affect human effort? When AIs predict well, might humans decrease effort too much (\u2018fall asleep at the wheel\u2019)? When should the AI or the human have the right to make the final decision? Are \u2018better\u2019 AIs in a statistical prediction sense necessarily more profitable for an organization?", "These researchers do not conclude that humans ought to make all decisions. They aren\u2019t anti-technology or fearmongering. If anything, they reveal skepticism about humans\u2019 ability to set aside their biases and accept new perspectives, and they propose that AI can help us move beyond our mental habits.", "What\u2019s also cool about this research is its different way of thinking about AI. The authors suggest we might not always want the most technically high-performing models that routinely offer near-perfect predictions and that might automate away the human role (what they call a \u201creplacement AI\u201d). Sometimes that\u2019s fine, but \u201cimperfect\u201d suggestions from AI might be more beneficial in some situations, they say.", "An \u201caugmentation AI\u201d that performs reasonably well and informs humans, but doesn\u2019t take over the final decision-making, could be the most productive (and also profit-maximizing) for many situations. Though imperfect from a technical standpoint, this collaboration keeps humans motivated to stay engaged in evaluating data from their uniquely insightful, valuable perspective. This human/AI \u201caugmentation\u201d allows for both efficient, boredom-reducing automation of decisions and humans\u2019 motivation to maintain awareness and catch errors.", "Surprisingly, these researchers suggest that in some scenarios, it might even be productive and profit-maximizing to use what they call \u201cunreliable AI\u201d or \u201cantagonistic AI.\u201d", "Unreliable AI might be ideal, they say, when there\u2019s a need to keep humans especially motivated to stay engaged. Imagine you\u2019re back in the self-driving car, but now the car has a \u201cfeature\u201d that sporadically turns off autopilot mode for one minute at unknown intervals. You don\u2019t know when that will happen, so you keep your hands on the wheel and maintain situational awareness instead of writing that email. You might hate that feature of the car, but you\u2019d have to admit that it keeps you alert. Similarly, an unreliable AI would ensure some human engagement and motivation by offering less-than-perfect performance, with human intervention required to correct its occasional errors.", "The \u201cantagonistic AI\u201d goes a step further by making decisions that actively \u201cantagonize\u201d or frustrate the humans who receive the AI\u2019s results. These decisions would be known to conflict with the humans\u2019 existing biases, forcing them to reconsider their preferences and think harder about why they want to make a certain decision.", "Imagine now that you\u2019ve input your destination \u2014 the local ice cream parlor \u2014 into your self-driving car\u2019s navigation system, and it responds, \u201cReally? Are you sure? No, let\u2019s go to the gym instead,\u201d and starts driving you to the gym. You\u2019d have to actively override the system to get back on track for your ice cream. While you might find the car\u2019s response pretty annoying, you\u2019d also (maybe reluctantly) have to ask yourself: Where should I be going right now: to get ice cream or to work out?", "The antagonistic AI makes decisions that humans may dislike so that the humans have to participate more deeply in decision-making \u2014 and, perhaps, will reevaluate their tendencies and biases in the process. The researchers use the example of a hiring manager whose AI tools suggest job candidates whose characteristics conflict with the manager\u2019s biases (e.g., affinity bias, a commonly held bias toward hiring people with similar backgrounds to one\u2019s own). The manager may find these suggestions frustrating, but they will have to make a more reasoned effort to explain to themselves and others why those less-similar candidates should or should not be considered for the job. Ultimately, antagonistic AI\u2019s ability to help humans make stronger decisions based on more thorough reasoning could support organizational goals and increase profit.", "We are only now starting to see how automation will free up time, creativity and innovation opportunities so humans can explore and design entirely new things.", "But as the research discussed here shows, maybe there\u2019s still another philosophical layer to these automated AI processes that we don\u2019t usually consider, something beyond maximizing technical performance. These technologies can do more than just reduce tedium while they complement human effort. They may also have the potential to change the way we think, in ways simple and profound. Even less technically ideal models might help us explore our reasoning and decisions by offering a new perspective \u2014 and help us to become more insightful, thoughtful people along the way.", "Read more about the first three questions in the chat.", "Originally published on the Alteryx Community and featured on the Alteryx Data Science Portal.", "Your home for data science.
