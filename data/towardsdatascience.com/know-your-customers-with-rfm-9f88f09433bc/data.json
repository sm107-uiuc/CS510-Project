You\u2019ll also learn how to implement the model with just a few lines of Python code. Whether you have a technical background or are a non-coder, I highly encourage all to follow along to get a sense of how easy developing a valuable RFM model can be. In a follow up blog post we\u2019ll expand on the RFM model and introduce more advanced techniques from the statistics and machine learning worlds.", "RFM segmentation will make you able to understand your customer base better, and also serve as a good starting point for your data journey and more advanced customer models. You will be able to give more accurate answers to key questions for your business \u2014 for example:", "RMF is a simple statistical method for categorising customers based on their purchasing behaviour. The behaviour is identified by using only three customer data points: the recency of purchase (R), the frequency of purchases (F) and the mean monetary value of each purchase (M). After some calculations on the RFM data we can create customer segments that are actionable and easy to understand \u2014 like the ones below:", "The above segments and labels are frequently used as a starting point but you can come up with your own segments and labels that is better fits for your customer base and business model.", "For each of the segments, you could design appropriate actions, for example:", "In this post we are going to use the Online Retail dataset \u2014 widely used on the internet for different analysis. It looks like this:", "After some investigation, we found that the data needed some cleaning up, so we have done some filtering to get better output\u2013remember: garbage in, garbage out. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done:", "We now have all we need to create the RFM model. Our transactions table now looks like this:", "To make the process of creating the model easier to understand, we\u2019ll show the data listings as we go along.", "In order to create the RFM score, we must get the individual data points for each customer\u2019s recency, frequency and monetary value. They are defined as follows:", "Recency: The age of the customer at the last transaction. This is slightly different from vanilla RFM where recency is calculated as the number of days since last purchase.", "Frequency: The number of purchases within the customers life span", "Monetary value: The mean monetary value for the customers transactions.", "The results after this step should be an RFM summary table with a unique customer id and the data for recency, frequency and mean monetary value. It should look something like this:", "We are only going to use the frequency, recency and monetary_value columns when segmenting. The T column (the age of the customer) is only used internally to calculate the value of recency and will not be used for future calculations.", "First, we\u2019ll do a quick inspection of our data and see how they are distributed.", "As we can see, the frequency numbers are highly skewed because of the high number of non repeat transactions. In fact, as many as 85,3% of the customers are non repeat customers. In order to create more sensible segments we choose to filter out the non repeat customers. Now the distribution looks like this:", "The recency data also has a better distribution after filtering out the non repeat customers. Without the filter, the plot would have been skewed heavily towards zero.", "Now, this is challenging data. As we can see, most of the customers mean monetary value fall between 0 and 500, but we also have a few customers that venture beyond 2000 and up to over 16000. These customers seem like outliers. One hypothesis for this can be that they behave more like businesses, buying for reselling. We decide to remove the \u201coutliers\u201d and set the threshold to 2k, which gives us the following distribution:", "Please note that we should investigate the outliers further and not just throw them away.", "Getting the individual RFM score can be done in several ways. You could use your own business expertise and heuristics to make rankings that suit your customer base. For this case, we are going to go the statistical route and rank our customer using quartiles .", "The ranking of the individual RFM scores is done by dividing each of the RFM values into quartiles which creates four more or less equal buckets. We then rank each bucket from one to four; four being the best. Our summary table should now look something like this:", "A recency(R) of 1, the lowest score, represents the customers that have been inactive for a while. A frequency of 4, the highest score, are your most frequent buyers, and so on.", "This step can be done in two ways:", "If we choose to do both concatenation and addition our summary table will now look like this:", "Even though segments like 411 and 243 may be interpretable by a human, they are not the most human friendly labels. But as promised in the beginning of the post, it\u2019s possible to create more usable labels both for the RFM segments and the RFM scores. For the RFM segment we are going to use the most common naming scheme, as outlined above. Our summary table will now look like this:", "As you see, we now have the champions and hibernators etc. in place.", "If you like the addition scheme more, we could create customer labels such as: bronze, silver, gold and platinum.", "To get a birds eye view of your overall customer base, we can plot a simple bar chart showing how many customers reside in each category:", "Unfortunately, it looks like most of our customers are hibernating, so we better get going. On the bright side: We have some champions, and also a few customers in the promising and new categories. We\u2019d better take good care of them.", "We can do the same plot for the RFM score and see how it compares.", "Naturally we see the same pattern: Few of the most valuable customers and a lot of customers who need attention and reactivation. Better get to work.What we have learned", "If the customers in the OnlineRetail dataset where ours, we could say that we have learned the following:", "As you have seen we can get actionable customer segments by using just three customer data points. The RFM model is a useful starting point if you\u2019re just starting in your data journey and it\u2019s both quick and easy to understand and implement.", "Your home for data science.
