I was not disappointed.", "The tweet at the start of the chain was about Hugging Face, a natural-language processing library. The project collects datasets that can be used for training & benchmarking of models. And some of these datasets are huge. In the initial tweet, Thomas Wolf points out that with a special file format, he and Quentin Lhoest are now able to iterate through 17GB of data in less than a minute with a RAM footprint of 9MB \ud83e\udd2f", "The first question that came to my mind: How? What magic is going on here?", "So that was the future Wes McKinney was talking about.", "Since there aren\u2019t many practical examples online, I decided to write an introductory blog post with hands-on example about what I\u2019ve learned so far. I\u2019m not affiliated with the Hugging Face or PyArrow project. At the end of this article, you will find links to all sources.", "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. \u2014 Arthur C. Clarke, 3rd law", "The first clue was Thomas Wolf referring to Apache Arrow. Apache Arrow is a project started by Wes McKinney, intending to create an interface for data exchange:", "Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess communication. [1]", "Before Arrow, the standard way of exchanging data between any application or library was to store it to disk in one way or the other. So if a .NET Core library wants to pass the data to Python for data analysis, chances were that someone would write out a file (e.g. csv, json, Parquet, \u2026) and then read it in again with Python. Both steps, the writing (serialization) and reading (deserialization) are costly and slow \u2014 and the bigger the dataset, the longer it takes to complete each of them.", "What if there was a way to exchange the data directly via handshake and zero copying? It could look like this: .NET would start chatting with Python, point to a pile of data in memory and be like: Hey pal, this is yours now. And Python could directly jump onto it without carting it from one place to another. Wouldn\u2019t that be fantastic?", "That\u2019s what Apache Arrow is all about.", "That left me wondering \u2014 how can I use Arrow? By looking at the source code of Hugging Face, I learned that the project uses PyArrow to read the data. Until then, I associated PyArrow with Parquet, a highly compressed, columnar storage format. So, is Parquet the way how Arrow exchanges data? (Spoiler: It\u2019s not)", "Traditionally, data is stored on disk in a row-by-row manner. Columnar storage was born out of the necessity to analyze large datasets and aggregate them efficiently. Data analytics is less interested in rows of data (e.g. one customer transaction, one call log, \u2026) but on aggregations thereof (e.g. total amount spent by customer, total call minutes by region, \u2026).", "This gave rise to changing the orientation: Instead of storing it row by row, columnar storage arranges data column by column.", "Parquet is a columnar file format which has two major benefits [4]:", "To better understand the difference between Parquet and Arrow, we will need to make a detour and get some intuition for compression. File compression is a huge subject on its own right. The following is a simplified narrative, filtered through my own understanding of the topic. This digression will help answer these two questions:", "Imagine you flip a coin ten times and record the result:", "Now, try to say the result out loud? Likely, you\u2019ll shorten it and say something like \u201c4 times head, 3 times tail, head and 2 times tail\u201d:", "That\u2019s compression in action (the described algorithm is called Run-length encoding [8]). We tend to naturally see a pattern and abbreviate. A compression algorithm does that too \u2014 just with more raw computational power and sophisticated rules. But this example should be sufficient to help us understand a key difference: While .csv takes the literal approach and spells out each single record, Parquet abbreviates (without losing any information).", "This simple example is sufficient to also get an intuition on why the compression ratio can widely differ. For instance, if the sort order doesn\u2019t matter and you are simply interested in the total occurrence count of head vs tail, you could sort the list first and then the compressed version would look like this:", "By implication, if we sort a dataset by all columns first before we save it to Parquet, the file size will be smaller compared to an unsorted one. The compression ratio will be higher the lower the cardinality. The compression ratio for each column is expected to shrink the further down it is in the sort order.", "With this, we gained some intuition of why Parquet files are so small compared to uncompressed .csv files. But how is that related to Arrow?", "It turns out that this is exactly one of the key differences. Parquet is stored in a highly efficient way on disk. And with filter pushdown you can reduce the volume of data read in (i.e. by selecting only the columns you actually need). But when you want to perform operations on the data, your computer still needs to unpack the compressed information and bring it into memory. [2]", "Arrow on the other hand is a memory-mapped format. In a blog-post Wes McKinney summarizes it as following:", "\u201cArrow serialization design provides a \u2018data header\u2019 which describes the exact locations and sizes of all the memory buffers for all the columns in a table. This means you can memory map huge, bigger-than-RAM datasets and evaluate pandas-style algorithms on them in-place without loading them into memory like you have to with pandas now. You could read 1 megabyte from the middle of a 1 terabyte table, and you only pay the cost of performing those random reads totalling 1 megabyte.\u201d [6]", "In short, applications can directly operate on a dataset stored on disk without the need to fully load it into memory. If you recall the initial Tweet \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what was going on there.", "Now let\u2019s explore these data formats. As a sample dataset I\u2019m using the Palmer Station Penguin dataset. Since it only contains 350 rows, I\u2019ll resample it to 1 million so that the performance difference becomes more apparent:", "As a next step I write the files to disk in three formats:", "Note that Arrow can only be converted to pandas without allocating memory (= zero-copy) under certain conditions. One of them: There must be no NaN values. To compare the performance between with & without zero-copying, I write the Arrow file once with and without missing numeric values.", "Parquet is as expected the smallest file \u2014 despite the random sequence (no sorting took place before writing the file out), it shines with a compression ratio of 80%. Arrow is only slightly smaller than csv. Reason is that csv stores even numeric values as strings which consumes more disk space. In all cases the size difference between files with missing values and without is insignificant (<0.5 MB).", "Now the key part: Reading performance. How long does it take to calculate average flipper length?", "Timing each of the three functions, the following results arise:", "Unsurprisingly, csv is the slowest option. It requires reading 200MB, parse the text, discard all columns except flipper length and then calculate the mean.", "Parquet is ~60 times faster since there is no need to parse the entire file \u2014 only the required columns is read in.", "Arrow with missing values is ~3 times faster than Parquet and almost ~200 times faster than csv. Like Parquet, Arrow can limit itself to reading only the specified column. What makes it faster is that there is no need to decompress the column.", "Note that the difference between reading memory-mapped Arrow files with and without zero-copying meant another ~3 times performance improvement (i.e. zero-copy is in total ~600 times faster than csv and ~9 times faster than Parquet).", "What\u2019s surprising: Arrow with the file API is even slower than Parquet. What\u2019s going on?", "To answer that let\u2019s look at the memory consumption. How much RAM is each file consuming if we read a single column?", "Most notable: Arrow with file API consumes 189 MB \u2014 which is pretty much the entire file size (even though we only read a single column?!). The answer lies in the documentation:", "\u201c[\u2026] OSFile allocates new memory on each read, like Python file objects.\u201d [3]", "By using OSFile the entire file was read into memory first. Now it's obvious why this operation was slower than Parquet and consumes the most memory!", "However, by using the memory-mapping function and with filled NaN values, the pandas DataFrame was created directly on top of the stored Arrow file. No copying: 0 MB of RAM! No surprise this was the fastest option.", "You can find the entire Jupyter Notebook here \ud83d\udcdd", "For me, there is lot to learn about Arrow. What I have learnt so far is: You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too. There is a trade-off between [7]:", "The performance gains of both Parquet and Arrow are significant compared to csv. When storing Arrow to disk, it consumes more storage than Parquet. However, Arrow beats Parquet in terms of reading performance \u2014 both in terms of time and memory consumption. The presented examples (calculate mean of one column/read column) are only scratching on the surface \u2014 my expectation is that with more complicated queries & bigger datasets Arrow would shine even more.", "As long as Arrow is read with the memory-mapping function, the reading performance is incredible. The best case is when the dataset has no missing values/NaNs. Then PyArrow can do its magic and allow you to operate on the table, barely consuming any memory.", "The future is indeed already here \u2014 and it\u2019s amazing!", "I will keep writing about Python, data and technology \u2014I\u2019d be happy to meet you on Twitter \u2728", "Big thanks to Yingying for the thorough review and great feedback! \ud83d\udc4f", "[3] Apache Arrow, On-Disk and Memory Mapped Files (2020), Apache Arrow Python Bindings Documentation", "[4] J.
