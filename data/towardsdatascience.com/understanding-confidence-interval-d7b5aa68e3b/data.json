How do we reconcile the two?"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://github.com/shawlu95/Data-Science-Toolbox/blob/master/concepts/data/engagement.csv", "anchor_text": "Udacity", "paragraph_index": 4}], "all_paragraphs": ["\u201cWe are 95% confident that the population mean falls within the confidence interval.\u201d", "As it turns out, the statement above is misleading. Confidence interval is a concept born of frequentist statistics, whereas the statement expresses a Bayesian belief. In this article, we will find out, through simulated experiments on real data, what confidence interval really means.", "The difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics is fundamental. The textbook example is flipping a coin. A frequentist statistician would flip the coin a million times, and, if 500k heads were observed, declare that the coin is fair. A Bayesian statistician would start with a prior belief on whether the coin is fair or not, and as he flips the coin, incrementally adjusts his belief based on the evidence.", "In the experimental context, a frequentist believes there is one single correct population mean that holds true regardless of what you believe, whereas a Bayesian person believes the population mean is a random variable: you assume it falls within a range of possible values, and you hedge your belief with a probability. In the simulation below, we will see why confidence interval can only be interpreted in the frequentist way.", "We will use the engagement dataset from Udacity. Each data point is the fraction of time of video tutorials a student has watched. If a student watched the entire course, he is 100% engaged, and his data point is 1. The engagement follows a exponential distribution. It is not surprising to see that most students drop out at the beginning, and only few students complete the entire course.", "In the real world, we would consider this dataset as a sample of size 8702. But in this simulation, we treat it as if we\u2019re the entire population, and draw one million samples of size 300 from it (a process known as Bootstrap sampling). Because we have the full population here, we can easily see that the mean of the sampling distribution is unbiased estimator of population mean (0.07727). Furthermore, it\u2019s easy to confirm that the empirically computed standard error is identical to the analytical one (0.0062).", "The population distribution is clearly not normal, but Central Limit Theorem assures that the sampling distribution is normal, given sufficiently large sample size (300 is more than enough). As shown in the density plot, the sampling distribution is indeed very normal. I added two vertical lines marking the 1.96 standard error above and below the mean. This is the z-score for two-tailed significance level of 0.05. In a normal distribution, there are 2.5% probability above, and 2.5% probability below.", "In our example, we have 2.06% lower tail, and 2.83% upper tail. The sampling distribution is positively skewed, because we cannot have negative values. This is consistent with the QQ plot. On the lower end, extreme values are less frequent than expected by the normal, whereas on the upper end, extreme values appear more frequently than expected by the normal.", "But in practice, this sampling distribution more than satisfies normality assumption: most data points nicely fall on the QQ plot diagonal. This is an important sanity check: the normal sampling distribution is the basic assumption of z-test and t-test (more on t-test later). If the sampling distribution is not normal, all test results are invalid.", "In reality, we don\u2019t know the population mean or standard error. After all, if we know the population mean, there is no need for statistical test or confidence interval! Also, we cannot afford to be frequentists. No one has the money or time to draw one million samples, or flip a coin a million times. We normally get only one sample, calculate the sample mean and standard error of the mean, add and subtract some t-score multiples of standard error to get our confidence interval.", "What if we can draw hundreds of thousands of samples? We have already simulated one million samples. In the code below, we build a confidence interval for each sample, and check whether the population mean falls within the confidence interval. Remember that we have precisely calculated the population mean to be 0.07727.", "It turns out that 94.4% of the confidence intervals capture the population mean. This is what confidence interval really means: if we repeat the sampling procedures infinitely many times, about 95% of the confidence intervals will contain the population mean.", "In other words, approximately 5% of the confidence intervals fail to capture the population mean. In the graph below, this happens when the blue dots (upper bound) cross below the population mean, or when orange dots (lower bound) cross above the population mean.", "So why is Bayesian interpretation inaccurate? Given any one of the confidence intervals, we cannot make any statement about the population mean itself. We don\u2019t know if it belongs to 95% of the intervals that contain the population mean, or the remaining 5% that don\u2019t. We cannot even infer about the distribution of data within a confidence interval. The confidence interval could enclose a fraction of the thin tail, or be centered exactly at the population mean.", "In summary, we know nothing about how data are distributed within a confidence interval, let alone whether it contains the population mean. The statement we can make is about the boundaries of confidence interval, not the location of population means.", "This article focuses on confidence interval on population mean. Often time we encounter confidence interval on proportion (z-test) and linear regression parameters. Still, the interpretation is the same.", "We live in a Bayesian world. One could be easily be forgiven for saying \u201cwe are 95% confident that\u2026\u201d Your managers don\u2019t want to repeat one million experiments after all, but when we tell others what it means, we should not forget that confidence interval is a frequentist concept.", "The following blogs covers topics relevant to AB testing, and more in-depth review of key concepts mentioned in this article.", "Your home for data science.
