And it also depends on you- your experiences, your career progression, and how much money really matters to you (pertaining to the position you apply for).", "For context on the figures I\u2019m about to introduce, let\u2019s take a look at some industry statistics. Today, Glassdoor lists the mean annual data science salary to be $112,000. Indeed has an average salary of $120,000, while PayScale comes in a bit lower with $95,000.", "On the other end of the scale, levels.fyi has a data science salary median of $150,000, and an insane $238,000 median coming from those in the San Francisco Bay Area. Out of curiosity-and sheer disbelief- I tried submitting a fake salary of $400k, and they still accepted it, so who knows?", "Check out this in-depth analysis of data scientist salaries for 2022!", "After graduating college in 2015, I had two different job offers waiting for me.", "The first was from a company called Workday, and they offered me a $95,000 base salary and $60,000 over four years in terms of stock. For total compensation, this equals out to about $110,000 annually. The position they needed to fill was actually for a Software Engineer in Performance, which is ultimately-spoiler alert- why I didn\u2019t end up taking the job.", "The second offer came from Inflection, and they were looking for a marketing analyst, extending a base salary of $85,000 with a $5000 sign-on bonus.", "So why did I end up taking a $25,000 pay-cut in accepting one offer over the other?", "Well, when I interviewed at Workday right out of college, they actually didn\u2019t ask me any technical questions. The interview was very casual- we laughed and joked around, and mostly talked about projects I had worked on in the past.", "Ultimately, while I was really happy with the offer (making six figures out of college was insane to me), I thought that the marketing analyst role would be more helpful for later transitioning to data science, and I was also a lot more excited to learn from my boss at Inflection.", "If you\u2019re interested in how I landed my first data science job out of college, check out my new grad data science guide and my youtube video on landing a data science job without experience!", "So as a new grad, I was making around $85k a year in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is definitely a really expensive place to live. My take-home pay after tax and everything was around $4000 a month, so, as you can imagine, I didn\u2019t have a lot of savings left over.", "Very quickly, I realized that this was the minimum amount I needed to survive. As someone new to the workforce that hasn\u2019t seen that much money before, it can be a little distorting to see those big numbers and having it end up being much less in real-life, but I saw this as a good opportunity anyway for a new grad.", "However, after working at Inflection for around three to four months, I started to feel like the company wasn\u2019t really for me. I wasn\u2019t learning a whole lot, and my boss ended up leaving in the first two weeks, so I decided to leave after a few months to seek out other opportunities.", "At this point, I was kicking myself for not taking that position at Workday, but I ended up taking a new job with Jobr, which is actually where I found the position. They reached out to me with a data scientist position (specifically working with the recommendation algorithm), and eventually, an offer came in for $80,000 with 0.5% equity, so my base pay would be cut by $5k.", "Equity works based on the evaluation of the company at that time, which was around $10 million. Jobr raised $2 million with that evaluation, so my 0.5% cut of equity meant that I was entitled to around $50,000 over the course of four years, with the possibility of that value increasing.", "Inside my employment contract, they had also included a clause that if they had raised the Series A, my base salary would go up to $100,000 once that Series A had gone through.", "At this point, I kind of felt like I\u2019d be stupid not to take the job because no one else was really interested in hiring me.", "So here\u2019s where a bit of luck came into play. After six months of working at my job, Jobr was acquired for $12.5 million by Monster, who was looking at my company\u2019s Tinder-for-jobs kind of app. Using that value, you\u2019d think that I\u2019d hit the jackpot with my share of equity at around $62,500. Unfortunately, no.", "If you\u2019re unfamiliar with acquisitions, basically when a larger company consumes a smaller one, there\u2019s a lot of lawyers, brokers, investors, and other middle-men involved. All in all, you can expect around a third of the amount you\u2019re originally supposed to get to go to a bunch of different people, even if it\u2019s above the evaluation the company raised (as it was in this case).", "To summarize, I guess the lesson here is that it\u2019s important to continually develop your skills, as that\u2019s what you\u2019re being hired for. Money comes later (with a little bit of luck!), but it helps to set yourself up for success first in your current environment.", "So after acquisition, earnout was also given out. Basically, revenue targets are set for certain metrics, and if you hit those, you can end up earning more from the acquisition. With the way it was written out in my contract, I\u2019d basically be able to receive another $40,000-$50,000 for every year after the acquisition.", "We ended up forecasting that we\u2019d hit around 90% of them, so my take-home ended up being around $150,000 annually after that first year.", "In 2017, the whole company in Jobr negotiated a raise from the parent company, so I got bumped up to $130,000 base-pay, making my total compensation per year at that point to be $170,000.", "In 2018, my third year out of college, I ended up switching jobs again. Everyone I had known originally at Jobr had left at this point, including my current co-founder Shane. The work culture had changed, and I really wanted to find another company that really fit and supported my needs.", "I knew that my total compensation was likely to decrease unless I interviewed for larger companies, but my main focus at this point was finding a place that I really liked.", "I signed up for Hired, and Nextdoor ended up reaching out to me after I set my base salary ($150,000) requirement. In hindsight, now that I\u2019ve learned a lot more about negotiation and interviewing, I don\u2019t recommend using Hired. Once you set your salary at a certain threshold, companies will end up using that when they\u2019re negotiating with you, setting up a salary expectation that\u2019s lower than what they can actually allocate to you.", "In this way, it\u2019s better to withhold salary expectations until the end of the interviewing process, but I still consider Hired a good place to get a job if you don\u2019t actually want to go out there and apply for X number of positions.", "So with Nextdoor, I went through the entire process (including the on-site interview), so I was having good feelings about the company when I met everyone. My offer ended up around $145,000, which is lower than what I expected given what I put in my Hired profile.", "This was a huge indication to me that their intentions were to start lower so we could negotiate up. In the end, I negotiated up to $155,000 with a $20,000 sign-on bonus, so my total compensation for that first year was $175,000. My offer included some equity as well, but this is much harder to calculate with a long-term unicorn like Nextdoor, as you don\u2019t really know when they\u2019re going to exit.", "Currently, I\u2019m at InterviewQuery, definitely making less than $175,000 a year. If I were to estimate given my career progression if I had taken another data science job, I probably could have secured around $190,000 in base salary, or maybe even more if it were at Facebook, Google, or Amazon, etc.", "If you\u2019re just about to be in the negotiation process or if you\u2019re just looking to break in data science salary numbers, here are some helpful rules that might change how you look at things.", "Honestly, this is just an unfair comparison overall. You would be doing yourself a disservice in trying to connect different data science salaries to other people who have different luck, experiences, and career trajectories.", "The general consensus is that you\u2019re worth the amount for which you can be replaced by anyone else in the field. So, for instance, if you\u2019re doing BI analysis as a data scientist, then you can essentially be replaced by a BI analyst at a lower salary.", "In this way, it\u2019s imperative to really understand what your role entails, as well as how you can grow, whether that involves becoming a manager, a technical lead, etc.", "When I was walking in and out of work every day, I didn\u2019t feel like I was walking out of $100k, or $200k, or whatever that equivalent is per hour.", "Understanding your goals (trying to retire or be financially independent versus being more focused on learning more) is incredibly important, as it dictates, ultimately, what kind of company you may end up working for, and as a result, the workplace environment and culture.", "If you\u2019re curious about the differences between working in data science between companies, be sure to take a look at our Start Up v. FAANG Companies article on our blog.", "Make no mistake, this also definitely depends on your interview, as you need to effectively communicate how much value you can bring with your experience.", "However, I\u2019ve seen many cases where people have similar skills, but one person was older with more experience, and as such, was earning a lot more money. As it stands, experience is still the #1 metric for determining how much money someone should make.", "I know, I know- it sounds kind of unrealistic, right? Of course, money changes things!", "But honestly, beyond the initial ease in being able to provide food and shelter for yourself, your internal happiness doesn\u2019t really change as the numbers do. You still end up going to work everyday, and your routines will probably end up being the same.", "The things that constantly change will be around your position, so work hard, and ultimately, be sure to enjoy what you\u2019re doing.", "Your home for data science.
