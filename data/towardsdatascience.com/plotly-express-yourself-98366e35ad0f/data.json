Plotly is awesome because you can create highly interactive visualizations, as opposed to static visualizations via matplotlib or seaborn (matplotlib\u2019s cooler sibling). For example:", "But the downside (at least for me) was that getting anything done in Plotly always felt like a lot of lines of code. For example, the code for the preceding plot looks like this (some data set up not included for brevity):", "Note that the above is written in R, not Python, because that\u2019s where most of my past experience with Plotly has been. But what I\u2019ve seen and used in Python seems similar in syntactical complexity.", "What Plotly Express does, is create an even higher-level wrapper around the base Plotly code, so the syntax is simpler. To me, that means easier to learn and easier to build coding muscle memory. Less copying and pasting code from old projects or Stack Overflow!", "To put it through the paces, I thought it would be useful to run through some standard exploration plots. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll hopefully end up with a handy cheat sheet for Plotly Express!", "2. Code for getting and scrubbing the data, as well as the snippets below can be found in this jupyter notebook here.", "3. If you haven\u2019t installed it or imported yet:", "4. We\u2019ll assume you have some conceptual familiarity with the plots shown below, so we won\u2019t be deep-diving into the pros and cons of each. But we\u2019ll also add some thoughts and references when available.", "5. The look of the following plots vary wildly because I was curious as to the look and feel of the various built-in templates (i.e. themes). So, apologies if that\u2019s annoying, but like I mentioned, I\u2019m trying to flex all of Plotly Express\u2019 muscles.", "Let\u2019s cover a couple of classic ways to perform univariate exploration of continuous variables: Histograms and Boxplots.", "You can read more about how cool histograms are here.", "\u2026And the boxplot. So elegant in its simplicity.", "More can be found on boxplots here, here, and here. But if you find boxplots to be a bit square, perhaps a violin plot will do?", "Violin plots are becoming increasingly popular. I like to think of them as boxplot\u2019s cooler, better-looking sibling. Ouch.", "But what if the variable or feature you want to explore is categorical, not continuous? In this case, you\u2019ll probably want to start with a bar chart to get a feel for counts of values.", "Here\u2019s a quick primer on bar charts.", "Univariate analysis is all well and good, but really, we usually want to compare variables to other variables to try to tease out interesting relationships, so we can build models. So let\u2019s keep building our plotly-express superpowers on some examples of bivariate techniques.", "Let\u2019s start with comparing continuous variables versus continuous variables.", "Scatter plots are the tried and true way of comparing two continuous (numeric) variables. It\u2019s a great way to quickly assess whether a relationship exists between the two variables.", "In the example above, we further give ourselves a helping hand at spotting a relationship by adding a trendline. It appears that there is a weak positive correlation between Strength and Intelligence.", "A special case of continuous versus continuous comparison are time series. The classic way to do this is with a line plot. Almost always the date/time variable will be along the x-axis while the other continuous variable is measured along the y-axis. And now you can see how it changed over time!", "What if we want to compare categorical versus continuous variables? Well, it turns out that we can just use univariate techniques, but just \u201crepeat\u201d them! One of my favorite ways is using a stacked histogram. We can make a histogram for our continuous variable, for each value of a categorical variable, and then just stack them!", "For example, let\u2019s revisit our histogram from prior, on Strength, but this time we'd like to see the data separated out by Gender.", "Maybe the stacks are confusing to you and just want to see the bars grouped by bins:", "\u2026Or if either of those looks were too visually busy for you, then maybe you just want a plot for each category value. You\u2019ll see this sometimes called faceting (or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to call it).", "Wow, I\u2019m histogrammed out. Let\u2019s look at applying the same faceting/splitting concept to box plots.", "And whatever box plots can do, violin plots can as well!", "So what about if you want to just compare categorical versus categorical values? If that\u2019s the case you usually want to look at relative counts. So stacked bars are a good way to go:", "Stacked Bar Chart (Categorical vs Categorical)", "Digression: It turns out that stacked bar charts are way easier using .histogram since it gives access to histfunc, which allows you to apply a function to the histogram. This saves steps from having to aggregate first (which you may have noticed was done for the bar chart above).", "We may be sensing a pattern here. We can turn any univariate visualization into a bivariate one (or more) by using another visual element, such as color; or by faceting/splitting along category values.", "Let\u2019s explore adding a third variable. A common technique is to add a categorical variable to a scatter plot using color.", "Maybe this data is not that interesting with the added category, but categories really stand out when you find the right pattern, such as with the classic iris data set\u2026like this:", "But going back to our original scatter plot with color, what if we wanted to add on a third continuous variable? How about if we tied it to the size of our markers?", "Scatter Plot, with Color and Size", "Below we add the continuous Power variable as the size of the markers.", "One thing I noticed is that the legend doesn\u2019t automatically add a legend for Size. That\u2019s a little annoying. What can I say, Plotly Express has already spoiled me over the course of this post!", "We\u2019ve barely begun to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible, based on what I\u2019ve seen in the documentation. We can go on and on, but let\u2019s end our exploration on a couple more examples.", "Scatter matrices perform pair-wise scatter plots on a set of continuous variables, which you can then customize with colors, symbols, etc. to stand for categorical variables.", "That was neat, but this next one I really like for its simplicity. The idea is you can add any of the univariate plots we\u2019ve covered to the margins of a scatter plot.", "Whew! That\u2026was a lot. But I think it\u2019s a good start on creating a quick reference to the more common plotting techniques, all using plotly express. I\u2019m really digging what I\u2019ve seen so far (everything we\u2019ve done in this post are technically one-liners!) and look forward to their future updates!
