You can avoid this with the right scoping & goal setting."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://bcxp.de", "anchor_text": "https://bcxp.de", "paragraph_index": 40}], "all_paragraphs": ["A lot of machine learning models are not making it into production. Some even call it the PoC curse: proof of concepts that show promising results, but no one ever uses them.", "Data scientists then often complain about data quality, broken data pipe lines or how hard MLops are. However, I think that a lot of models were doomed to fail even before they were trained.", "Just as with any other project, scoping and goals can decide on failure or success of your forecasting project. Sometimes we spend too little time on these important steps when starting a new project. Especially teams that have a certain distance to the future users (e.g. digital innovation teams, data labs and other cross-functional departments) must be aware of this danger.", "Let me share some tips on how you can avoid the PoC curse in the early project phase.", "The goal for a forecast project seems pretty clear at the beginning of the project. In some project you are asked to predict customer churn, in the next you should forecast the retail sales and in another project they asked to forecast the energy consumption of a certain process in a lab.", "However, in most cases, your project\u2019s sponsor is not getting paid for making forecasts. She gets her paycheck for achieving business results. The forecast model you are about to make should help her in getting better results. Ask her what actions will be taken depending on the results of the forecast model:", "Why is this important? You might face situations where people are talking about the possible advantages the company could gain using the forecast model, but not one of them is actually making the decisions to make this possible. Chances are high that these advantages are only illusory and won\u2019t be realized.", "Steve (project member): \u201cIf we only knew which customer was about to leave, we could offer them a discount. That would be great!\u201d", "You: \u201cWho will decide if a customer receives a discount and the amount?\u201d", "Steve: \u201cOh, that\u2019s the account managers. Let\u2019s see if Sara can join our discussion.\u201d", "You: \u201cHi Sara, we thought about a new application that could support you. It would be able to predict customers that are about to leave and you could offer them a discount!\u201d", "Sara (account manager): \u201cHmm. Our customers normally leave because of missing features. They rarely ask for discounts once they\u2019re on board. We don\u2019t have that many customers. I already know those who are not happy and why.\u201d", "This does not necessarily render your churn prediction model useless (and Sara might not know her customers as well as she thinks she does), but you need to get more insights about the decisions your model will be supporting.", "Knowing the decisions to be taken can be beneficial when evaluating the accuracy and precision of your model. It can even change the necessary machine learning model drastically.", "A stakeholder might tell you that they need a regression model for a weekly forecast of the raw material consumption with a horizon of 6 months. However, all they really need for the decisions to be taken (purchasing more or less raw material) might be a classification model that indicates whether the consumption the month after next is about the same, 20% below or 20% above the past month\u2019s consumption.", "That\u2019s why you should always think coming from the decision.", "Once you know the relevant decisions you should get the relevant decision makers on board and committed to the project. One of the best ways to get a commitment to the project from the decision makers is to involve them when setting the project\u2019s goals.", "Other relevant people are those that own the systems that can provide data for your model, groups that normally handle analytics & BI projects, architects that set IT standards or teams that will be responsible for operations of the model.", "Some might not be able to contribute a lot at the beginning, but it\u2019s better if they already know you and your project once you need their support. Early feedback also helps to avoid all sorts of unpleasant problems later, like this one:", "Peter (data owner): \u201cThis is our data. You cannot use it.\u201d", "You: \u201cBut it is the company\u2019s data. Our model depends on it.\u201d", "Peter: \u201cThe data was never thought to be used for automatic forecasts. I need three more positions to ensure the quality of the data. I will take this into account for personnel cost planning. We can talk next year.\u201d", "Clarify the requirements of all the relevant stakeholders early on. Another example: it\u2019s easier to start with Python right away than to find out later that the operations team won\u2019t even consider deploying a Julia application.", "Depending on the project you should also talk to those responsible for data protection & security, e.g. the data protection officer.", "Avoid getting into white board modelling and feature engineering early on. Instead ask how your solution might improve the everyday life of your stakeholders, their customers and your future users.", "Why should someone use your model if it\u2019s not beneficial to them? If it\u2019s only their boss telling them to use it, you can be sure that they will find the smallest quirks and inconsistencies in your model.", "People will not care about a better R\u00b2 or awesome F1 score. They do care about their work & time and maybe status as well. For some of them it will be enough motivation to use a fancy AI application, but for others you will have to offer more substantial improvement. It\u2019s much less esoteric than you might think. Ask your stakeholders and future users:", "How will you and your colleagues notice that our project was successful?How will this make your working life easier?", "Everyone is talking about customer intimacy, why not think about them as well:", "How will your customers notice that our project was successful?How will this make their life easier?", "Asking these questions and getting answers might take some hours, but it will be much more beneficial than two weeks of hyperparameter tuning.", "Once you have all the stakeholder\u2019s commitment, you know the decisions to support and how to improve everyone\u2019s life, there\u2019s still this one little complication of forecasting projects: it\u2019s really hard to predict the future.", "Although we are making progress, many machine learning projects are still a lot more like a research project than a development project for some business application.", "Start the project from the beginning with optimism, but be honest that a lot of progress will be like this: \u201cGreat, now we know that the consumer confidence index is not useful to predict sales.\u201d", "Additionally, don\u2019t even bother to start with too few data. Many companies just started to think about becoming a data driven company and don\u2019t have data lakes containing decades of data and a lot of start-ups don\u2019t even exist long enough.", "If you want to predict raw material consumption and your production process follows an annual pattern you won\u2019t succeed with one and half years of data.", "If you want to predict retail sales and your typical product life cycle is seven years, three years of data is not enough.", "Speaking out about risks and requirements will help to manage stakeholder expectations and make your life easier.", "I hope you found these insights useful. Thanks for reading and I\u2019m looking forward to your comments and forecasting experiences!", "Your home for data science.
