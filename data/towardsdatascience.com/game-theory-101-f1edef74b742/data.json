It\u2019s so prevalent that we often don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. Students of economics, marketing, political science, game design, and artificial intelligence use game theory versions daily. In each of these disciplines, the main goal is to understand how people respond when presented with specific situations or decisions. A careful observer will see this play out in any political election or marketing campaign.", "While game theory merely paints a picture of reality, it is a useful tool that works surprisingly well. Game theory utilizes a framework to handle conflict and compromise between rational decision-makers. Traditionally, a rational decision is one that maximizes one\u2019s payoff while adhering to a given set of constraints.", "As with any discipline, game theory has its own vocabulary and constructs. This article will introduce its terms and principles through the most basic decision problem, the single-person decision.", "In a single-person decision, there is only one player. Player is the term used in game theory for any entity capable of making a decision. Part of game theory is making assumptions about the behavior of the players. Our outcome is only as good as our assumptions. Therefore, a significant part of game theory requires us to challenge our assumptions. But for today\u2019s lesson, we\u2019ll keep it simple.", "We all face multiple decisions every day. A congressman decides how to vote on a particular bill. A product manager decides to cut a feature before the release date. Even the trivial decision about which shirt to wear is a daily occurrence. Each decision we confront has three parts.", "Let\u2019s use the trivial decision mentioned earlier of choosing a shirt for the day. You have two shirts, red with no pattern and the other is blue with a pattern.", "We will denote the set actions as A = {r, b} where r represents choosing your red shirt, and b represents choosing your blue shirt.", "Now let\u2019s define the set of outcomes. In this case, X = {x, y} where x is wearing the red shirt, and y is wearing the blue shirt.", "With such a simple example, the difference between actions and outcomes is subtle. The actions are choosing a specific shirt, and the outcome is actually wearing a specific shirt. But you\u2019ll get the point just the same.", "Outcomes and actions do not always align so closely. For example, an action may be to reduce spending. The outcome would be heavy layoffs. Although the outcome is still a consequence of the chosen actions, they are very different from each other.", "Furthermore, the list of possible actions is not always as discrete as our two shirts example. Perhaps you have an available budget of $50 million, but you are not required to spend it. Your actions could be a range of A = [$0, $50 million]. Notice the square brackets indication the interval of $0 to $50 million instead of the {} indicating discrete actions.", "Now, let\u2019s introduce preferences. Imagine your favorite color is red and, therefore, you prefer wearing your red shirt. In game theory, we represent this preference with the notation x \u227f y. This symbolic construct is read as \u201cx is at least as good as y.\u201d This is just game theory\u2019s formulaic way of expressing you prefer your red shirt.", "Of course, the preference that \u201cx is at least as good as y\u201d is a weak one. And that\u2019s how we refer to it. It\u2019s a weak ranking. There are two other forms of ranking, also borrowed from traditional economics and decision theory. One is \u227b indicating a strict preference, \u201cx is strictly better than y,\u201d and ~ indicating indifference, \u201cx is equally as good as y.\u201d", "Before we go any further, let\u2019s introduce a requirement imposed on the player. The player is not allowed to be indecisive between any two outcomes. This is called the completeness axiom. If presented with outcomes x and y, the player must prefer either x \u227f y or y \u227f x.", "In addition to the completeness axiom, we impose another rule called the transitivity axiom. It states that for any three outcomes, if x \u227f y and y \u227f z, then x \u227f z. In real words and concrete ideas, this means that if we have a third shirt that is purple with polka dots and we prefer our red shirt over our blue shirt, and we also prefer our blue shirt over our purple shirt, then we must prefer our red shirt over our purple shirt.", "To summarize, the completeness axiom guarantees any two outcomes can be ranked against each other; I prefer my red shirt over my blue one. And the transitivity axiom ensures there will be no contradiction between those rankings. Without these two rules, we could end up with an indecisive scenario. Game theory prohibits the use of an indecisive player. A preference relationship that is both complete and transitive is called a rational preference relation.", "Keep in mind that if we include more than one player in our model, it is possible to end up with an irrational group even when each player is rational. But our single-player decision problem will not encounter this kind of scenario.", "In most cases, preferences and outcomes come together to form a payoff function. Usually, in business, the payoff function returns a dollar value. But the only requirement is an ordinal value such that the higher the value, the better the payoff.", "When dealing with something sufficiently simple as choosing a shirt for the day, our preferences are often synonymous with the payoff function. In these situations, we assign a payoff function value for each outcome based on preferences, such that if x \u227f y, then the payoff function returns a greater value for x than for y.", "Returning to our three shirts example, we recall the preferences were red \u227f blue and blue \u227f purple, and therefore, red \u227f purple. We assign a payoff value of 10 to red, 5 to blue, and 1 to purple. These numbers are arbitrary except for the necessity of red\u2019s value being greater than blue\u2019s value, and blue\u2019s value greater than purple\u2019s value. We could have used 2000, 1000, and 1 for red, blue, and purple, respectively. The scale is inconsequential.", "If we view the relationship between the player, the options, and each respective payoff as a decision tree, it would resemble the following diagram.", "Finally, we\u2019ve arrived at the complete concept. Remember, we require a rational agent as a player. This is known as the rational choice paradigm. It asserts a decision-maker will rationally choose his best action. For this to hold, we assume the player knows all possible actions, all possible outcomes, precisely how choosing each action will manifest itself in an outcome, and his preferences across all outcomes.", "This list of assumptions may seem overwhelming or even unrealistic, but if we sacrifice any of them, we cannot assert the idea of rational choice. The decision examples in this article have been kept simple and at an introductory level. The value of the payoff function is easy to determine and clearly indicates the best choice of action. However, some payoff functions are mathematical formulas requiring calculus. In these situations, you may need to plot the payoff function results to choose the best action.", "Game theory is an integral part of many disciplines and provides great value when applied properly. An understanding of it, even at a basic level, goes a long way toward making logical choices in today\u2019s more complex business decisions.", "Your home for data science.
