Wasn\u2019t the whole idea that more data is better?", "Any time you\u2019re trying to model something that happens in the world, more examples of that thing happening can only help your model to improve.", "But, knowing more details about each example doesn\u2019t necessarily help. It might even hurt, if the extra details are irrelevant to what you\u2019re trying to learn.", "Intuitively, it\u2019s hard to see how this could be true. Height plus favorite color probably won\u2019t predict body weight any better than height alone. But, how does it hurt to get this extraneous information?", "The key is that you don\u2019t always know whether extra information is relevant and, until you complete the process of figuring out whether it\u2019s useful, it can obscure the real relationships in the data.", "An example will make this clearer.", "Let\u2019s imagine two very contrived car dealerships. The first sells Japanese cars and offers either a Subaru Outback or Toyota Prius. The second sells German cars and gives its customers a choice between a high-end Mercedes and a VW Beetle.", "Both dealers want to optimize the efficiency of their respective sales teams and have determined that they could save a lot of time if they could predict which car a customer is most likely to buy when he or she walks onto the lot.", "And, both dealers decide to solve this problem by having their greeters collect some information about the customer, score it, and pass that information on to the salesperson who will work with the customer.", "Each dealer decides that the two data points most likely to predict customer choice are buying power, i.e. how much the customer can afford to spend, and urgency, how quickly a customer wants or needs a new car.", "After collecting data for a year, the first dealership creates this plot. Blue dots represent Outback purchases and orange dots represent Prius purchases:", "The two inputs seem to have some influence on the outcome. Orange dots favor the upper left and blue the lower right. But, there is a lot of overlap with no clear separation of Prius and Outback buyers. So, they decide to add another piece of information.", "The Prius is a smaller hybrid car with high gas mileage. So, they decide to take into account how important fuel efficiency is to the customer. The new data looks like this:", "This is exactly what we hope to see when we add more information. The third dimension reveals a clearer separation of the data into two groups. In this case, even with no additional data points, the additional input makes it easier to learn from this data.", "Now, let\u2019s look at an example where a third dimension doesn\u2019t help.", "Over at the second dealership, the initial data collection exercise shows promising results, right away. This time, orange dots represent Mercedes and blue dots represent VWs.", "This is the kind of graph we hope to see when we first plot data. The two categories are clearly separated into clusters with few, if any, outliers. They run an ML algorithm on the data and it finds the two circled clusters.", "Nonetheless, an eager salesperson at the German car dealership notes that in his experience, education level is a good predictor of who will buy a Mercedes. Why not add this factor to the model, he asks? In the worst case, it won\u2019t tell us anything that we didn\u2019t know already.", "So, the dealership adds an input to the model reflecting number of years of college completed and produces this graph:", "As with the first graph, there is a clear division of the data into two clusters. But, the new information is a red herring.", "Education level is clustered around 0 and 4 years, with few values in between, perhaps because most customers either attended 4\u2013year colleges or didn\u2019t go at all. But, each cluster contains about the same number of Mercedes and VW buyers.", "The third dimension, education level, revealed a distance between the data points that is uncorrelated with what kind of car they will likely buy.", "In the contrived example, the new data actually misleads us. But, even if it had been only irrelevant and added random noise, it would suggest artificial distances between data points. And, as we add more and more of these irrelevant data points, the irrelevant distances between data points will come to dominate the ones we care about.", "Like human statisticians, a good machine learning algorithm can eliminate uncorrelated features, when the data clearly shows that they are uncorrelated. But remember, we\u2019re always working with only a sample of all possible data and there is a small chance that any two samples will look correlated, even if they\u2019re not.", "Making a dataset wider, by adding a lot of extra fields, increases the odds that something somewhere will look like it\u2019s correlated when it\u2019s not. The only way to mitigate that risk is to make the dataset deeper by adding more examples.", "Your home for data science.
