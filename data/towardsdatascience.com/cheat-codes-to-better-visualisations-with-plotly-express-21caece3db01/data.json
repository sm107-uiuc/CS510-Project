I want to show how using the Plotly Express module from the Plotly library we can get the simplicity of Seaborn and Matplotlib, but achieve a more in-depth and interactive visualisation.", "Plotly Express is an easy-to-use and a high-level interface of the Plotly library. So, let\u2019s have look at how we can get started.", "Let\u2019s look at some datasets already in the Plotly Express module:", "Let\u2019s look at the tips dataset using histograms because the data includes a lot of categorical variables. For the first one, I\u2019ll use the total bill as the variable to plot as a histogram.", "With Plotly Express we can create an interactive histogram. We can see the bin range by the x-axis, the total_bill value, and the count at each point when hovering the cursor.", "Let\u2019s level up our histograms by considering a second variable, sex:", "Now we can see both male and female count for total bill, but on top of the hovering interactivity, we can also isolate the histogram to show either male, female, or both.", "Another minor update to a histogram can be adding a rug plot, a box plot, or a violin plot:", "Here I have used a rug plot and now we can see the data points relative to the bins below in the histogram. As you may be wondering, you can interact with the rug plots as well.", "Another popular and effective visualisation type that Plotly Express not only simplifies yet enhances, is the scatter plot. Here we are looking at the iris dataset; which is about the sizes of different plant species.", "We can make this scatterplot more dynamic and informative by adding colour, size, and more interactive data.", "Having the ability to isolate or group the plants by species on one set of axis with the addition of different colours helps us from having to create three individual plots for comparison.", "A traditional line graph is also very simple with Plotly Express.", "Line graphs are great for comparing two rows from a dataset, and this can be done by adding one more attribute to the plot. In this case, colour for country.", "Here we have two countries from Oceania so they were both allocated a colour, without having to mention the names of the countries, but only the column name for the argument of colour.", "We can add more continents other than Oceania, but how do we keep graph from becoming overwhelming?", "Showing the continent as the colour then setting the line group as the country, allows us to visualise the life expectancy in different continents without having to average the life expectancy for all the countries within that continent.", "Once again we can isolate lines of the continents if individual observations are preferred, as well as a hover ability to check the country represented by each line.", "More simple code for bar charts.", "We can add more information about the change in population throughout time in Canada, by including life expectancy using colour. Upgrade axis label pop to population of Canada, using the labels attribute of bar charts, and also add more detail to the hover function.", "Above, we can depict two trends about the Canadian population over time with one graph effectively.", "Looking back at the tips dataset, we could stack a lot more information into a bar chart visualisation.", "We have five columns of the dataset that we can observe, accompanied with some interactivity. By using row and column facets we have a grid layout for days of the week and time of meal; consisting of smaller bar charts which contains a summary of the type of person (smoker and sex) and their total bill.", "Let\u2019s get 3D. Here we are looking at the election dataset where the votes and outcomes of three candidates running for Mayor in Montreal are compared by the district.", "Combined with Plotly\u2019s hover interactivity this plot manages to display all the information from the election dataset.", "Geographical charts are used in more unique situations but can also be easily done using Plotly Express.", "We have a very useful addition to the visualisation; which is the animation interactability. For this dataset I have chosen the year as the animation frame; so we can either autoplay throughout the years or manually select the years.", "Although the above globe shaped visualisation is interesting to look at, the following map visualisation will be better for a person to observe and analyse the information.", "Now we have a very clear visualisation showing life expectancy around the world over time.", "The animated scatter plot (a bubble chart) is my favourite visualisation, as it explains the information well and it is very dynamic.", "So, using Plotly Express we can make great visualisations with interactability, that don\u2019t require more than a few intuitive lines of code.", "Your home for data science.
