There are great people in other platforms like Quora, StackOverflow, Youtube, here, and in lots of forums and platforms helping each other in many areas of science, philosophy, math, language and of course Data Science and its companions.", "But I think in the past ~3 years, the LinkedIn community has excel on sharing great content in the Data Science space, from sharing experiences to detailed posts on how to do Machine Learning or Deep Learning in the real world. I always recommend to people entering in this area to be a part of a community, and LinkedIn is on the best, you will find me there all the time :).", "The research in the Deep Learning space for classifying things in images, detecting them and do actions when they \u201csee\u201d something has been very important in this decade, with amazing results like surpassing human level performance for some problems.", "In this article I will show you every post Akshay Bahadur has done in the space of Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL). If you are not familiar with any of those terms you can learn more about them here:", "To perform video tracking an algorithm analyzes sequential video frames and outputs the movement of targets between the frames. There are a variety of algorithms, each having strengths and weaknesses. Considering the intended use is important when choosing which algorithm to use. There are two major components of a visual tracking system: target representation and localization, as well as filtering and data association.", "Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing.", "This is all the code you need to reproduce it:", "Yep, 54 lines of code. Very simple right? You will need to have OpenCV installed in your computer, if you have Mac check this out:", "This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents. This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is drowsy.", "Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.", "It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is lesst than 0.25, Alert is generated.", "This code helps you classify different digits using softmax regression. You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.", "Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.", "The dataset used was MNIST with images of size 28 X 28, and the plan here is to classify digits from 0 to 9 using Logistic Regression, Shallow Network and Deep Neural Network.", "One of the best parts here is that he coded three models using Numpy including optimization, forward and back propagation and just everything.", "And finally with a Deep Neural Network:", "To run the code, type python Dig-Rec.py", "To run the code, type python Digit-Recognizer.py", "This code helps you classify different alphabets of hindi language (Devanagiri) using Convnets.

This concept uses inception network which has been taken from source and fr_utils.py is taken from deeplearning.ai for reference. I have added several functionalities of my own for providing stability and better detection.", "You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning and you\u2019ll need:", "A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiples methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.", "This code helps you to recognize and classify different emojis. As of now, we are only supporting hand emojis.", "You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning and you\u2019ll need:", "Emojis are ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. They are much like emoticons, but emoji are actual pictures instead of typographics.", "I can only say I\u2019m incredibly impress on these projects, all of them you can run them on your computer, or more easily on Deep Cognition\u2019s platform if you don\u2019t want to install anything, and it can run online.", "I want to thank Akshay and his friends for making this great Open Source contributions and for all the others that will come. Try them, run them, and get inspired. This is only a small example of the amazing things DL and CV can do, and is up to you to take this an turn it into something that can help the world become a better place.", "Never give up, we need everyone to be interested in lots of different things. I think we can change the world for the better, improve our lives, the way we work, think and solve problems, and if we channel all the resources we have right now to make these area of knowledge to work together for a greater good, we can make a huge positive impact in the world and our lives.", "Thanks for reading this.
