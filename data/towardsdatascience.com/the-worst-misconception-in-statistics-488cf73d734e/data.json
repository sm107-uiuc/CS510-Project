That\u2019s how I know the likelihood ratio test solves a lot of problems. I also became aware of this pervasive misconception:", "The t-test assumes the data is normally distributed.", "Non-rigorous intro to stats courses spread this misinformation. To make matters worse, many websites echo this false statement (though some say the t-test is robust to non-normality).", "The t-test is almost sacred in its importance and widespread use, so this misconception is a double whammy of both frequency and severity. People think they can\u2019t use the t-test when in reality they can. It\u2019s like teaching children \u201cthe spoon can only be used to scoop up liquids.\u201d", "This manifests in questions like \u201cMy data fails normality tests so I can\u2019t use the t-test. Should I log-transform? Or should I use a nonparametric test?\u201d when they have 100,000+ observations. (\u201cMy teacher said I shouldn\u2019t eat ice cream with a spoon because it\u2019s a solid food. Should I melt the ice cream so it transforms into a liquid? Or should I use a fork?\u201d)", "If you Google \u201ct test assumptions\u201d, literally every result on the first page, other than Wikipedia, parrots this untruth. (Some scoff at Wikipedia as being an untrustworthy source. Oh the irony.) Wikipedia says:", "The means of the two populations being compared should follow normal distributions. Under weak assumptions, this follows in large samples from the central limit theorem, even when the distribution of observations in each group is non-normal.", "Thank you for being a voice of sanity! The means, not the data!", "We often test whether or not two groups have the same mean:", "In the frequentist framework, we set up the problem so that the test statistic follows a known distribution under the null hypothesis. If the test statistic follows the t-distribution (normal with unknown variance), then we can perform the t-test.", "Test statistic. Not the data. Our test statistic is t, computed from the difference in sample means.", "For really small sample sizes, this requirement holds only if the data is conditionally normal, hence the misconception. For n>30\u2026", "But seriously, some intro courses go the opposite extreme and suggest that the t-test is always valid when n>30 or n>40? We\u2019ll see why this is also incorrect.", "With adequately large sample size, the distribution of sample means becomes approximately normal due to the central limit theorem. The required sample size depends on the population distribution: more skew / heavier tails, more samples. If both of your sample means are normally distributed, then a linear combination (like the difference in means) is also normal so the t-test can work its magic.", "Also, the sample variance should be \u03c7\u00b2 distributed but we\u2019ll gloss over that in this article.", "Consider this exponential distribution, which is decidedly not normal:", "If we sample from this distribution, then the data will resemble the exponential distribution as n grows large.", "(In the worst misunderstanding of the CLT, someone asked: \u201cI surveyed 30 people and the distribution is not normal. What did I do wrong? Isn\u2019t the data supposed to be normally distributed?\u201d)", "But if we record the average of our random sample and repeat this process many many times, then we roughly get the normal distribution as long as n is large.", "Would you look at that. The distribution of the sample mean looks almost bell-shaped to me. Turns out we don\u2019t need our data to be normally distributed to perform the t-test!", "If you\u2019re not sure whether or not your n is large enough for the central limit theorem to kick in, you can bootstrap. A short tutorial follows.", "Suppose we sample from these two distributions and want to test equality of means:", "Neither of these distributions are normal. Here I\u2019ll take samples of size n=10 from the red group and n=20 from the blue group:", "We sample with replacement from each group in our data, maintaining n (10 for red and 20 for blue), and record the difference in means. The sample size of the resamples should correspond to the sample sizes in your original data.", "Shift this distribution by our observed difference in means; we pretend that under the null hypothesis the two populations retain their shapes but have equal means. This is naive, especially for nonnegative random variables (they like to change shape depending on the mean), but it works decently enough. We treat this as our null distribution.", "It might be easier to follow along with some code:", "If this null distribution is a nice bell curve, then a t-test is appropriate. Otherwise, compute the p-value as the percentage of simulated values that are equal to or more extreme than our observed difference \u2014 in other words, the proportion of simulated values that lie outside the red bars (here p = 0.0601):", "The bootstrapped p-values can vary due to the inherent randomness in the process. More iterations lead to better approximations of the p-value. With larger n, we can see why the t-test works even for this non-normal data. Here I set n = 50 for both groups:", "It looks almost bell-shaped to me, even with n as low as 50. The tiny skew will make the t-test slightly off. Bootstrap yields p = 0.0019 while t-test yields p = 0.0012.", "When n = 100,000, very rarely will t-test not be applicable, even if the data is not normally distributed.", "Some websites recommend transforming your data so it looks roughly normal. I\u2026 I don\u2019t even know where to begin. How does this get passed around as \u201cgood advice\u201d? (I remember believing this and passing it along when I was new to statistics. Oh the shame.)", "When you transform your data, the hypothesis changes. You are no longer testing the difference in means. For instance, if you use the log-transform, you are testing the difference in geometric means.", "Despite how different they look, they have the same population mean of 1.65!", "Here we take 1000 samples from each group:", "Because of the large variance, it\u2019s difficult to see anything. Let\u2019s zoom in a bit:", "So the shape of the distributions are different. If we run a t-test on our entire sample, we get p = 0.6578, and we correctly fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "The natural log of our samples:", "If we run a t-test on this we get p-value close to 0, and we falsely reject the null hypothesis of equal means. The two distributions have the same arithmetic mean but different geometric means.", "In this case, running t-test on the raw observations is inappropriate (see bootstrap below) but we get the correct conclusion anyway. Running t-test on the log-transformed observations satisfies the \u201ct-test assumptions\u201d (both groups are normal) but it gives us a wrong conclusion \u2014 it answers a question, but not our question.", "The error can go the other way. It is possible for two populations to have different means but the same geometric mean, such as LN(0, 1\u00b2) and LN(0, 3\u00b2) with arithmetic means 1.65 and 90.02, respectively:", "Their means are very far apart, but the log of the values have the same mean:", "Again, I have no clue why several resources recommend log-transforming your data before passing it through a t-test. It\u2019s extremely misleading.", "Let\u2019s go back to the original lognormal distributions LN(0, 1\u00b2) and LN(-4, 3\u00b2). If you want to be careful, you can bootstrap:", "Remember how I said the required sample size depends on skewness (among other things)? Earlier with the exponential distribution example, n=30 looked enough. Here, n=1000 is still not enough! The lognormal has such an extreme skew and a fat tail that we typically need a lot of samples to test means.", "When your data is really, really skewed with not enough samples, a nonparametric test can be preferable to bootstrapping. The problem is when people mindlessly use nonparametric tests because of a little skew. They are less powerful than parametric tests. When you are stuck with small-to-moderate sample sizes because collecting data is difficult / expensive, using a nonparametric test when you can use the t-test will result in more false negatives.", "Nonparametric tests come with their own set of assumptions and test entirely different hypotheses. For instance, the popular U-test can only be interpreted as testing equality of medians if the two distributions have the same shape, making it even more restrictive than the t-test in many cases.", "In closing, the t-test most certainly can be used on non-normal data when your n is large enough. And when in doubt, you can bootstrap. Together, let\u2019s put an end to these misconceptions and bad practices.", "Your home for data science.
