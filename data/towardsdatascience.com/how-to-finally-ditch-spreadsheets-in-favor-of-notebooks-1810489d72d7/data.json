However, it is not always so straightforward to get started and plug everything together.", "That is the reason why, for this article, I will use Deepnote, a free, hosted, and plug-n-play service where you can run notebooks, have real-time collaboration, and natively access different databases.", "The dataset used in this article is the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, it contains information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.", "Since this dataset consists of nine different tables in .csv format it is helpful to have a schema of the dataset, AKA a map that helps us to understand how tables are related to each other, giving the possibility to perform a different operation such as VLOOKUP, SUMIF, CONCATENATE and many others.", "You can think of it as having different sheets related to each other.", "In this section, a set of business questions related to most of the common KPIs and insights for e-commerce are shown along with the code/solution to achieve it. More precisely, we will answer question-related to:", "The goal of this question is to find out the total value of sales by the hour, day, week, and month. It can be answered by grouping orders by the desired dimension and then the SUM function can be applied.", "To answer this question we will need access to the timestamp (order_purchase_timestamp) when an order is created, and the value of the order. We can achieve this by using two different tables: olist_order_payments_dataset and olist_orders_dataset, according to the database schema, the two tables can be joined together using the order_id column. Let's do this!", "However, after inspecting the dataset, I noticed the there is a column named, meaning that the values in the payment_value column are not reflecting the real order value. To have the real order value, we will have to multiply the number of installments with the payment value.", "This KPI gives insights about how a typical shopping basked value evolves: from this is possible to understand if customers tend to buy multiple items in one order or rather have many small transactions. It is helpful when, for example, when architecting some promotions or discounts.", "To achieve this we can use a strategy similar to the previous one: we will group transaction value by the month and get the average.", "Knowing the location where a customer is based opens the gates for many things: it is possible to understand which areas are more profitable than others, where our customers are based, and which regions/cities tend to spend more (or less) money on our platform.", "To get the data ready we can, again, have a look at the schema: the olist_customers_dataset table contains information on the customer's geography. We can use this table and do some groupby along with value_counts:", "To get this view it is necessary to merge the olist_orders_dataset with the olist_order_items_dataset, the two tables can be joined using the order_id column. Then, similarly as before, it can be possible to count values of the product_id column. However, to get the item category, another join operation is needed: the item category name is stored inside the olist_products_dataset, which can be joined with olist_order_items_dataset using the product_id column.", "Everything seems to work well, however, product category names are in Portuguese, and not in English. Luckily the dataset comes with another table product_category_name_translation which, for every category name, the translated name in English. We can substitute the Portuguese column with the English one:", "It is now possible to apply the value_counts function and plot the 20 most common categories:", "In this short guide, I wanted to show some basic operations that could help you switch from the old-fashioned spreadsheet to notebooks. Additional examples, tips, and guides can be found in the pandas documentation.", "Regarding this dataset, in particular, I want to give you some starting points where you could expand this tutorial, for example, you could use the olist_geolocation_dataset along with the joined olist_customers_dataset and olist_orders_dataset to create some heatmaps using gmaps displaying, for example, where the highest number of orders comes from, or where the average basket value is higher.", "Moreover, another good idea could be to create some sort of clustering model for customers, using variables such as the city a customer comes from, the number of orders, the category of products the customers buy, and many more.
