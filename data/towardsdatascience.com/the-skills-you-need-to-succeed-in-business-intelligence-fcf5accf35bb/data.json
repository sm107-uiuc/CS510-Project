Whether it\u2019s in Excel files, on-premise databases or in the cloud with online services and social media. But not all companies have the necessary resources in-house to make sense of it all. To wrangle all that data together then to analyse and visualise it in order to gain valuable insights and make smarter business decisions.", "That\u2019s why Business Intelligence skills have become some of the most valued and highly sought-after in today\u2019s jobs market. Having Business Intelligence on your resum\u00e9 is something that will make you stand out from the crowd and instantly make you a more valuable proposition for potential employers.", "Here, I\u2019ll be giving you a general overview of the different skills you\u2019ll need to acquire in order to succeed in Business Intelligence.", "So we\u2019ll start with the most obvious, the basic foundation and source of all business intelligence, data. For a geek like me, data can be quite exciting. It\u2019s nerdy, I know, but I actually often get a buzz out of getting access to a brand new data source for the first time. It\u2019s like diving into the unknown or setting off on an adventure into uncharted territory to discover things that no one has ever discovered before.", "Because, sometimes, that\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m doing. Manipulating and aggregating the data, and crunching the numbers to gain insights from it. To learn things that neither I nor the data\u2019s owners knew before. Anyway, I digress a little but not without reason. I\u2019m kind of demonstrating to you that, unless you can get passionate about data, there\u2019s not much point in exploring the possibility of a career in data science. So that is the first skill you need. Well, more of a character trait really.", "When it comes to data though there are 3 main areas you need to know about:", "\u201cTo learn things that neither I nor the data\u2019s owners knew before\u201d", "\u2018What it is\u2019 means what it\u2019s made up of and the different formats it comes in. Fairly straightforward basic stuff that\u2019s quick to learn. To find out more about what data is made up of, check out this video from the Vitamin BI YouTube channel.", "In terms of the different formats it comes in, well that depends on its source. You essentially have structured (in this I\u2019ll include semi-structured) and unstructured data. Structured data tends to be the kind you would probably most associate with what data looks like. The kind of traditional rows and columns tabular format you might find in an Excel spreadsheet.", "Unstructured data is basically everything else. And by that I mean literally anything else. Emails, videos, audio, pdfs, log files, anything. I must say that unstructured data is fairly uncommon when it comes to the realm of BI so it\u2019s not something you would necessarily need to be an expert on (I\u2019m certainly not).", "You would however need to be very familiar with structured data, which tends to be stored in Relational Database Management Systems, or RDBMS. We\u2019ll talk more about these shortly. What I mean by \u2018familiar\u2019 is how they function in terms the \u2018relational\u2019 model as it pertains to the storage of data. Also how to access and query these kinds of databases. More on this coming up.", "This leads quite nicely into the 2nd element of data I mentioned, where it is. So, as I said, the data you will need to deal with, more often than not, is structured data that\u2019s stored in some kind of relational database, things like MySQL, Postgres SQL, SQL Server (more on this in a minute) or it could be something as basic as an a csv (comma separated values) file or indeed an Excel file. To analyse these last 2 properly in BI tools, however, they will need to be structured just like a table in a relational database is, i.e. in a tabular rows and columns format.", "Going back to relational databases, they\u2019re either on-premise or in the cloud. So either installed on an in-house server or, as the popular meme jokes, on someone else\u2019s computer, i.e. the cloud. The cloud is in fact much more than just that but for the purposes of this discussion that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re talking about.", "I just mentioned some of the different SQL database types. Well, there are cloud versions of these as well. So instead of installing one yourself on an in-house server, you can essentially rent what\u2019s called an instance of one in the cloud.", "Ok, so now we\u2019ve covered the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 of data. The third part is knowing how to access and query data. Again, we\u2019ll break this down into the different types of data.", "When it comes to relational databases, they have what\u2019s called a host address, basically its IP address where it can be contacted. And then you need to use a username and password that\u2019s been set up in the database in order to connect to it and query its data. To query just means to \u2018ask questions of\u2019 and this is done using the query language called SQL, also commonly called/pronounced \u201csequel\u201d. It stands for Structured Query Language and it has different versions (like I mentioned before, MySQL, Postgres etc) whose syntax varies slightly but is mainly the same when it comes to querying.", "When it comes to cloud data sources (other than those cloud versions of RDBMS), the way these are communicated with is usually via what\u2019s called an API (Application Programming Interface). The most common types of these are REST and SOAP. They have what are called endpoints that let you access specific datasets and the way querying works is that you make calls to the API, that contain parameters, asking it to return the data you want.", "So I guess a good question you might want to ask here is, \u201cdo I need to learn all about how APIs work?\u201d and the answer is \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. Yes, you do need to have a good understanding of how they work because you may be called upon to write custom API calls to query data and, if you haven\u2019t got a clue about them then you\u2019ll be a bit lost but you don\u2019t need to be an expert, know how to build them, that kind of thing.", "When you\u2019re working with these online services and their data sources, you\u2019ll more than likely be doing so with a BI tool. And normally, the tool you\u2019re working with will have a data connector for that specific source, which means you don\u2019t need to formulate the individual API calls yourself. If it doesn\u2019t have a connector then you\u2019ve chosen the wrong tool which is a whole different story. So again, although it\u2019s a good idea to have basic API knowledge in your tool belt, it\u2019s not essential.", "So, basic knowledge of APIs is a good idea but not essential. What is mandatory, in my eyes however, is knowing SQL for querying. Not necessarily how to build and administer databases, but how to select the data you need to work with, how to filter and pre-aggregate it and how to join different tables together into what are called \u2018views\u2019. You may be asking \u201cbut won\u2019t the BI tool be able to do that for me as well?\u201d. The answer to that is almost definitely yes. However, the problem is that you may need to do some work on the data before you connect it to your BI tool. Let\u2019s say that the data you need to visualise is contained across several different tables in a database. These tables contain all historical data, let\u2019s say millions of rows in each. But you only want to query data for a specific period of time. And you don\u2019t need all of the dozens of fields (or columns) of every table. To just connect to all that data with your BI tool and then query that is really inefficient. It means that your BI tool is going to need to aggregate millions of rows across different tables for every query which will make your dashboards really slow to load.", "And what if your BI tool doesn\u2019t have a graphical interface that you can use to join the different tables together? You\u2019ll need to know the SQL code to do that as well.", "All this being said, BI tools are becoming more and more advanced in their capabilities and functionalities so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be able to do most of what I\u2019ve talked about without knowing SQL. But what if you can\u2019t?", "Another benefit of knowing how to query data using SQL is that it helps you to understand how querying works in general. How queries are formulated to join and aggregate data.", "If you\u2019d like to learn basic SQL in 15 minutes, check out this video on my YouTube Channel (once you\u2019ve finished the article, of course).", "After you understand and are comfortable with data you\u2019ll then need to know how to use BI tools. Or, more specifically, how to use one BI tool inside and out. And I mean how to do everything with it, become a full-on expert. Because once you have experience of pushing one BI tool to its limits, you\u2019ll then probably be able to use any other BI tool to a fairly proficient degree within a very short space of time. This is because most of them function in a very similar way. And the reason for this is that there isn\u2019t 100 different ways to query the same data. The result behind the data visualisations you\u2019ll need to produce for your dashboards is identical so it stands to reason that the way to get to that result using different tools should be very similar.", "Here\u2019s a question: Have you ever used a pivot table? If you don\u2019t know what that is then watch this video here. If you have then you pretty much know how to use a BI tool to query and visualise your data. Because most BI tools, at least the ones I\u2019ve seen, basically have a pivot table engine at their core to query data. The way the tool\u2019s interface presents the functionalities of the pivot table model will differ, the way things are named, how the elements of the query are placed into the pivot table etc. But it\u2019s still a pivot table at its core.", "Of course there\u2019s more to a BI tool than visualising data by placing data fields into a pivot table. You\u2019ll also need to know how apply manipulations to the results of queries and also create custom fields by writing formulas. Lots of BI tools have their own proprietary language for writing them that you\u2019ll need to learn. Others will actually incorporate elements of SQL or something very similar (like Google\u2019s Data Studio). So, another good reason to learn SQL.", "Writing custom formulas is all part of the day to day of working in BI. Because a lot of the time you\u2019ll be problem solving. Which is why I talked about pushing one BI tool to its limits. Because, once you have, you\u2019ll become familiar with the kinds of problems you\u2019ll need to solve. And although the data is always different, the same kinds of problems always have a tendency to reappear. So by learning how to solve these problems using one tool you\u2019ll be better equipped and know how to approach them when using a different one.", "The next skill to have is to know how to effectively visualise data and build reports or dashboards.", "There is far more that goes into a dashboard than just trying to make it look as pretty or as cool as possible. So much more. Data visualisation theory is something that\u2019s important to have a solid grasp of and there are some really great books on the subject. If you\u2019d like to learn more then I\u2019d suggest a great place to start would be \u201cThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information\u201d by Edward Tufte (affiliate link).", "In terms of dashboard design there are certain rules that you should follow like making sure you tell a story and not overloading dashboards with too much information. I\u2019m not going to go into much more detail than that because I\u2019ve written another book dedicated to this subject. If you\u2019d like to get your hands on a copy just get in touch via my email at the end of this book.", "Here are some other things that might indicate whether you\u2019d be suited to a career in Business Intelligence.", "I mentioned right at the beginning about how I got excited about getting my hands on new data. It\u2019s worth repeating that if this doesn\u2019t resonate with you then you should probably look at a different career choice.", "Solving problems is what you\u2019ll be doing a lot of if you pursue a career in Business Intelligence or Data Science. Rarely do projects that involve wrangling data from multiple different sources go as smoothly as planned.", "The good thing, however, is that the longer you\u2019ve been doing the job and the more projects you\u2019ve worked on, the more you will anticipate these problems and plan ahead to deal with them. Not all of them, but at least some.", "This ties in with data visualisation. It\u2019s all well and good knowing the hard and fast rules of good dashboard design. But they will only get you so far. You\u2019ll also need to have an artistic, creative side as well to take your dashboards to the next level and have clients coming back for more or recommending your work to others.", "So, do you think you have what it takes to succeed? This was just a very high-level look at someone the basic skills and knowledge you\u2019ll need to acquire. What else have I missed do you think? Let me know!", "For more articles like this one, don\u2019t forget to follow and check out my YouTube channel.", "Your home for data science.
