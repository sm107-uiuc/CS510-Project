Most of the topics will involve A/B testing, more machine learning conceptual questions, exploratory data analysis, and some coding questions.", "This stage comprises of 5 or 6 back-to-back interviews, each, one on one, or with two people; a manager and a junior data scientist. In total, the onsite interview will last for around six hours.", "This is what the process looks like:", "Each stage will likely test your knowledge of Amazon leadership principles and your critical thinking and problem-solving ability.", "Your home for data science.
