This optimises the organisation\u2019s productivity and efficiency.", "During the worst moments of the 2012 economic crisis, many charity and NPO organisations did an intense and recognised work in cushioning the impact of Spain\u2019s economic crisis. Additionally, many studies of poverty and social inequalities in the country\u2019s urban areas were undertaken.", "This implied that these organisations had to handle large volumes of data in their different levels of administrative management (e.g. Streets, Neighborhoods, Districts).", "The information generated annually by these organizations produce a wide range of difficulties to its analysts, particularly in data handling and interpretation. This was mainly due to the volume, heterogeneity and variety of the generated data by the organisations\u2019 activities.", "In fact, several agencies specialised in the use of GIS technology for NGOs have appeared in recent years to fill a gap that until relatively recently did not exist.", "My proposal focused on the implementation of a GIS platform for the organisation\u2019s activities management, both in its data management planning as well as in its external exploitation strategy.", "The implementation of GIS in the processes of management and operation of large volumes of data within NGOs help to optimise valuable resources in a more efficient manner as well as provide a better knowledge of the information generated from its activities.", "In addition to an optimisation in the management of information and Big Data, another benefit provided by GIS to NGOs would be a qualitative improvement in their ability to communicate the impact and outreach benefits derived from the process of charity in the territory as well as any other work done by the organization.", "In this regard, prior the GIS platform adoption, there are three key factors to be considered in a web-based GIS social impact assessment.", "Optimisation of the internal databases of the organization by identifying difficulties in its management and operation as well as promoting their standardisation for their use in future GIS projects by facilitating the constant update.", "Enhancing communication of the work of the organisation through the design and implementation of a communication strategy as agile as the generation of maps that will allow a greater potential audience knowing the dimension of the work done by the NGO.", "Introduction of new information technology tools in the analysis, management and organisation\u2019s data production processes. GIS will allow in a first phase the identification of problems concerning the organisation\u2019s data management.", "Cloud technology has become a key infrastructure in different sectors for different purposes from Big Data and industrial productivity solutions, to the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) applications.", "For instance, in the education sector, the development of Big Data management have shown one of the most relevant cloud platform features, the flexibility, by responding the temporary demand associated to online education.", "In addition, the management of Big data in strategic sectors such as healthcare is one of the most interesting aspects of cloud technology. The protection of patient information and the implementation of GDPR directly influence the progressive migration of hospital backups to the cloud and the management of heterogeneous data generated by a hospital network from the cloud.", "Besides flexibility, more notable aspects are scalability and reliability of the cloud platforms. This is apparent especially when it comes to managing large volumes of heterogeneous data, as is the case in public or private healthcare systems. The cost savings in the migration of hospital back-ups, development of predictive models of customer behavior, marketing campaigns or consumer studies for retail are a major advantage.", "Cost savings, flexibility, seamless maintenance and easy deployment, make cloud platforms the best option for the development of GIS analysis in the socio-economic, environmental and strategic infrastructure management sectors among many others.", "\u201cCloud GIS could be defined as a next generation on-demand GIS technology that uses a virtualized platform or infrastructure in a scalable elastic environment\u201d.", "There is no doubt that cloud platforms presents new opportunities for existing technologies and emerging ones based on widely known concepts such as GIS.", "Cloud technology has revolutionised the way GIS analysts work. Although the GEO sector has been slow to adopt cloud platforms in its work processes, a large number of GIS organisations and consultancies have moved projects to the cloud.", "The big data generated in maps are now managed in real time in the cloud, and tools that were recently only developed for desktop are now possible in Web-GIS versions thanks to the cloud.", "Many applications developed in the cloud now allow the management of large GIS database storage.", "For instance, this is the case of companies developing airborne raster technologies that use the cloud as a basis not only for providing a faster and simpler service to their customers, but also as a structure from which new useful applications can be developed in different areas such as engineering and the maintenance of complex infrastructures.", "3D modelling technology is widely used in disaster and emergency management, especially in remote areas of the world where rapid and effective assessment is needed.", "The possibility of handling large volumes of data, applications, geospatial analysis and the possibility of sharing them with other users in real time.", "Return of investment (ROI) optimisation. Less time to share and publish maps, with data/maps always available;", "Ability to choose various deployment, service and business models to best suit the organisation\u2019s objectives.", "Availability 24H/7: In future GIS projects, NGOs would have access to the files generated from the layers created to facilitate availability at any time.  At this point, the implementation of cloud technology would make sense. This would save the cost of outsourcing work that the institution could perfectly do wellin the future.", "Summarizing the most important aspects to take into account before implementing a web-based GIS in a cloud platform could be:", "a) Definition of the activities in the organisation\u2019s area of activity. This will permit the management to optimise the potential resources needed.", "b) Detailed knowledge of the organisation\u2019s work, spatial and thematic, describing in detail the location of the process of charity in the territory at the different administrative levels.", "c) Improvement, homogenization and standardization of databases. Due to the high volume of data, many non-profit organizations detect a lack of management of their databases.
