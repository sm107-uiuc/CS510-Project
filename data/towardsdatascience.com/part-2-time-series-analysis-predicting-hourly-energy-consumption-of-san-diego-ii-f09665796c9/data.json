And have predicted the hourly energy consumption values for 1st April to 31 Dec 2018 (~15% of the entire data).", "The final goal for this project is: \u201cThe developed forecasting model/s can be utilized by the electrical utilities to effectively plan their energy generation operations and balance the demand with appropriate supply. An efficient forecast can prove very useful for the utilities in planning their day to day operations, meeting their customers\u2019 energy demand, and avoiding any excess generation of energy.\u201d", "Basically, we want to fit an ML model onto our hourly energy consumption time series and use that to predict the future energy consumption of San Diego.", "Prediction WindowIn any time series problem, it is very important to define the window of prediction beforehand. Here I have tested the models on a future window of 1-hour, 1-week, and ~8 months.", "Error Metrics UsedI have calculated R2 score, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE for each model for the training and test sets. Out of the 4 metrics, MAPE will be chosen to select the best model. MAPE helps us to understand the % error on the absolute value and is indifferent to the absolute magnitude of the time series.", "AssumptionsAll ML models have some assumptions and here is one of them that was used for this project:", "Without much ado, let\u2019s focus our energy on the time series prediction problem.", "Time series is a sequence of observations taken sequentially in time. Any time-series data has the following components: ref link", "Another important feature of most time series is that observations close together in time tend to be correlated (serially dependent). This feature is also called as auto-correlation and, as we will see later, forms an important aspect of the conventional time series modeling techniques like AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).", "Due to all the above features, modeling a time series involves a slightly different approach than regular ML problems. Here is a good link explaining the main differences.", "Here is another good resource for diving deeper into time series forecasting modeling techniques.", "In the energy forecasting domain, it is even more important to get the daily max demand right, because that can determine if the plant operator needs to switch ON a peaker (mostly gas) plant or not. So, calculating the error on that too.", "\u201cWe are ready to build the future-predicting models now.\u201d", "Note: Some of the classical time series models that are generally used for time series forecasting are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX), Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt Winter\u2019s Exponential Smoothing (HWES), and more. You can find more details about each model in this article. We will try our hands only on SARIMAX in this post and then try the traditional linear and non-linear ML models.", "So, why should we even consider using traditional ML regression models for time series forecasting?", "The energy consumption values can also be expected to depend on it\u2019s previous lagged values because the energy consumption of a region shouldn\u2019t be expected to change much in the next few hours except for any unexpected or unfortunate events. So we will add the lagged values of energy consumption as the X parameters and check if we can predict better using the past values (in addition to the variables that we had already added).", "We can see from the graphs and the errors, when compared to the baseline, the elastic net model performs much better on all error metrics.", "The main diriving point behind this feature transformation is that we cannot just feed in the hours as 0,1,2,\u2026.22,23 to the model, because we need to make the model understand that 0th and 23rd hours are in reality as close as the 0th hour is to the 1st hour. Same for the weekdays and years.", "Adding Fourier cyclical series for hour, year, and week periods", "From the above plot, we can see how the discrete weekday values have been transformed into a more continuous variable pattern. The same can be visualized for hourly and yearly variables too.", "The SARIMAX model takes many inputs which require some tuning to be able to pick the best model parameters. pmdarimapackage\u2019s auto_arimamodule automates this task and gives us the best model by taking in some input ranges, similar to gridsearchcv.", "Let\u2019s try using FBProphet for our problem. FBProphet provides a decomposition regression model that is extendable and configurable with interpretable parameters. Prophet frames the forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise rather than looking explicitly at the time-based dependence of each observation within a time series. Similar to SARIMAX, we can add extra regressor terms like temperature data to the model as well.
