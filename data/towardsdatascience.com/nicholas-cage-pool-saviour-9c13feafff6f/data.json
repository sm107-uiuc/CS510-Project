Somehow, I feel that there\u2019s a secret meaning behind this somewhat rushed analysis I did over the weekend. That somehow, somewhere, the magic that is Nicholas Cage on film is not isolated to the depths of my heart, but in fact encompasses the world like Nicholas Cage\u2019s magnificent mane from Con Air, as seen in the title picture. Let\u2019s take a tour of what I probably shouldn\u2019t have done. If you want to skip to the good part, the graph you\u2019re looking for is halfway down the page, its super fun.", "In your wanderings of the internet, you may have come across this fun graph.", "The purpose of this graph and others like it on tylervigen.com is to educate people on the fallacies of believing correlation equals causation. Now, while it certainly looks like there\u2019s a relationship between the number of movies Nicholas Cage has appeared in and the number of people who drowned by falling into a pool, we know this is simply not the case.", "However, as an enormous fan of Nicholas Cage, I believe that perhaps there IS more evidence beyond this simple correlation. What if we tried to set a different set of Nicholas Cage related data against our pool data? Would we find a correlation? Better yet, would we find a NEGATIVE correlation? Would we find that something about Nicolas Cage and his somewhat glorious film career REDUCES deaths by drowning in pools? I had to find out.", "The most obvious place to start examining the Nicholas Cage effect on our pool drowning data would be a look at the quality of his films. That is, do good Nicholas Cage movies help to reduce pool deaths? To do that, I headed to Rotten Tomatoes to take a look at good old Nick\u2019s career. A quick glance showed that his career spans an impressive 38 years, with over 100 films to his credit. They vary from hits like Leaving Las Vegas to box office bombs like Ghost Rider\u2026and its sequel (seriously, I love the guy but who would pay for that?!).", "So after a little light web-scraping using Beautiful Soup (sorry Rotten Tomatoes, it\u2019s for the greater good though!), I was now the proud owner of Nicholas Cage\u2019s rated filmography. The next step was cleaning the data. I wanted to specifically target films where Nicholas Cage was not solely credited as a Producer, or Director, or any other positions. I felt the best indicators of success were for films where Nicholas Cage had appeared on screen, or contributed his unique voice and diction that had historically delighted audiences. So goodbye to The Life of David Gale (no idea he was the producer), goodbye to Shadow of the Vampire (really? that\u2019s so cool!), I needed Nicholas Cage the legend!", "Next I wanted to clear out the movies which had no score. These were either films in which Cage either acted in and were never released, or were released and never reviewed. The ratio was more heavily weighted in the former\u2019s favor. I did come across one anomaly, A Thousand Words starring Eddie Murphy, which had a 0% rating from critics, but fortunately Cage was credited only as a producer on that film, and so it could be safely dropped with our initial cleaning.", "Finally, to order up our data, we use a Pandas groupby command to average out the scores by year. This will help line up our scores with the drowning data. The final result? Highly gratifying.", "Isn\u2019t this amazing?? Now, I freely admit, I\u2019ve made just another spurious correlation graph here, but its hard to resist really taking a look at this and drawing some interesting conclusions, all spurious of course.", "For example, the years 2003\u20132005 were some of Nicholas Cage\u2019s best years. In 2003 Matchstick Men came out, followed in 2004 by National Treasure, Lord of War, and The Weather Man. These are some of Nicolas Cages most iconic movies, wildly successful, and we see a steady downward trend in drowning deaths in those years. Things start to get a little crazier from 2006 onwards, which started out great with the highly rated release of World Trade Center, but finished poorly with the infinitely meme-able release of The Wicker Man, where we see Nicholas Cage in a bear suit, punch a woman dressed like an 18th century settler.", "Things really start spinning out of control in 2007 with the release of Ghost Rider, Next, and National Treasure 2, and is only saved by his brief appearance in Robert Rodriguez\u2019s GrindHouse. The collective \u201cbadness\u201d finally comes to a head in 2008 where Cage\u2019s worst film (in this sample), Bangkok Dangerous, and pool deaths rises to a high of 123. Finally, there\u2019s an interesting negative correlation of -0.577172. It\u2019s not the best, but it\u2019s a lot higher than I expected, although really, lower than I would have liked.", "Lastly, just for fun, I ran a simple linear regression on the model using statsmodel\u2019s OLS, which yielded the following results:", "Our R\u00b2 value is pretty low, I would have preferred something in the .6 to .7 range which would have helped argue the case for Nicholas Cage as our spiritual Life Guard. An interesting figure in this data is the coef halfway down the OLS summary. It basically states that with a degree of error, every point Nicholas Cage\u2019s films get, pool drownings go down 0.0119 per year, which kind of helps our case a bit.", "Well, its done, but even though I didn\u2019t get the correlation or causation I wanted, the results were nonetheless interesting. I can\u2019t help but think with 2 sets of Nicholas Cage data showing a relationship with death by drowning in the pool that there isn\u2019t SOMETHING to the correlation. One thing I\u2019m hampered by is the lack of more data regarding deaths by pool drowning. The CDC has very broad classifications for death by drowning, and I was unable to determine which were by pool specifically, and which were done in other types of bodies of water. The original source for data was via a one and done weekly report covering 1999\u20132009. Perhaps another will be released soon for the years 2009\u20132019. With more data, maybe I can find a stronger relationship. After all, we know that Nicholas Cage\u2019s career has taken a dramatic downturn, I can\u2019t help but wonder if pool deaths has risen in correlation with his career. Perhaps my next Cage analysis will center around box office returns and pool deaths. Could the causation lie in the box office draw of Nicholas Cage, that people are watching his films and staying away from pools? Only further analysis will tell us! In the end, I think I can only say that Nicholas Cage, screen legend, has something to do with pool safety! Also, that new movie with the truffle pig? Definitely watching that!", "All code for this analysis is available on my Github", "Your home for data science.
