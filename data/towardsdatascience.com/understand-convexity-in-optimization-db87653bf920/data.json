Having a good understanding of convexity helps you prove the intuition behind the idea of gradient descent. So let us discuss the same.", "I hope you have a good understanding of gradient descent. Check out this article for a recap.", "To simply things, think of convex sets as shapes where any line joining 2 points in this set is never outside the set. This is called a convex set.", "Take a look at the examples below.", "It is evident that any line joining 2 points on a circle or say a square (the shapes on extreme left and middle), will have all the line segments within the shape. These are examples of convex sets.", "On the other hand, the shape on the extreme right in the figure above has part of a line outside the shape. Thus, this is not a convex set.", "A convex set C can be represented as follows.", "Consider the graph of a function f. An epigraph is a set of points lying on or above the function\u2019s graph.", "Okay, now that you understand what are convex sets and epigraphs, we can talk about convex functions.", "A function f is said to be a convex function if its epigraph is a convex set (as seen in the green figure below on the left). This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is always equal to or above the function graph. Pause a minute and check for yourself.", "This means that a function f is not convex if there exist two points x, y such that the line segment joining f(x) and f(y), is below the curve of the function f. This causes the loss of convexity of the epigraph (as seen in the red-figure above on the right ). This means that every line segment drawn on this graph is not always equal to or above the function graph. The same can be proven by taking points on the bends.", "Most of the cost functions in the case of neural networks would be non-convex. Thus you must test a function for convexity.", "A function f is said to be a convex function if the seconder-order derivative of that function is greater than or equal to 0.", "Examples of convex functions: y=e\u02e3, y=x\u00b2. Both of these functions are differentiable twice.", "If -f(x) (minus f(x)) is a convex function, then the function is called a concave function.", "Examples of concave functions: y=-e\u02e3. The function is differentiable twice.", "Let\u2019s check for convexity by plotting the exponential function e\u02e3.", "As said earlier, gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm that is used to minimize a cost function.", "To understand how convexity plays a crucial role in gradient descent, let us take the example of convex and non-convex cost functions.", "For a Linear Regression model, we define the cost function Mean Square Error(MSE), which measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Our goal is to minimize this cost function in order to improve the accuracy of the model. MSE is a convex function (it is differentiable twice). This means there is no local minimum, but only the global minimum. Thus gradient descent would converge to the global minimum.", "Now let us consider a non-convex cost function. In this case, take an arbitrary non-convex function as plotted below.", "Instead of converging to the global minimum, you can see that gradient descent would stop at the local minimum because the gradient at that point is zero (slope is 0) and minimum in the neighborhood. One way to solve this issue is by using the concept momentum.", "Convex functions play a huge role in optimization. Optimization is the core of a machine learning model. Understanding convexity is really important for the same, which I believe you did from this article.", "Your home for data science.
