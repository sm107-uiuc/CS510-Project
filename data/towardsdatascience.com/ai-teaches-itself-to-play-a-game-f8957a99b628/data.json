The game is, the ball should keep on rolling through the gap between the pipes, if the ball hits any of the pipe then we lose. As and when a ball successfully passes through the gap between the pipes, the score will be increased by 1.", "The Gif image above shows the training process of how neural network improves generation after generation and the progress status can be seen the in game window using the below three values.", "The complete code to build the game interface and the related files are in my Git repo.", "Now lets come to the training part using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks, a detailed description of the algorithm is here. The basic idea here is instead of relying on a fixed structure for the network, NEAT allows it to evolve through a genetic algorithm. So it builds a most optimal network by itself by adding nodes, connections and layers as and when required to accomplish the task in hand.", "Once we have a game ready, we feed the below inputs/parameters to the NEAT algorithm to create a best neural network which accomplishes the task, in our case rolling the ball through the gaps.", "We pass all these parameters through a Configuration file.", "Inputs for the Network: Telling the NEAT algorithm what inputs the network can expect and what output we need.", "Fitness Parameters: Way to evaluate how good the network/ball is like distance.", "In NEAT we call the population members as genomes/species and once the properties of genomes are set as above, neat starts building a network by creating a population of balls which we set it to 20. Each ball is associated with a completely random neural network that controls it & each network has its own random weights and biases. So we test each of the neural networks and see how well they do by evaluating their fitness. Fitness depends on what task/game we play, in this case how far the ball progresses. Every pipe it crosses we are adding 1 to its fitness score in the game.", "At the end of the first generation when all the balls are exhausted, neat sees which among them performed the best. It then picks those best of the last generation of balls/networks (two or three with the highest score), mutate and breed them to create a new set of population. A detailed explanation of how neat actually breeds and mutates these neural networks are in this paper.", "Now we will have the off-springs of the best species/balls from the last generation. So we hope that these next generation of species/balls perform better compare to the previous generation. What neat actually does is, it updates the weights, randomly adds/removes the nodes and connections until it finds an architecture that works best for the problem we are solving. It starts with a simple network and gets complex if required. We need to continue the process until we are satisfied with the performance.", "After a few generations of slowly learning and getting better, it finally pick up a pattern of moving ahead without hitting the pipes. In this case with the current set of parameters, in the 4th generation itself, AI starts performing better and reached a point where it never fails as we could see in the above gif image.", "Once the score reaches the fitness threshold we set, then we can exit the training by saving the neural network associated with that ball using pickle. Then create a game with one ball and the best Network we saved. Now it plays seamlessly by never hitting the pipe.", "Thanks for reading, happy learning. :-)", "Your home for data science.
