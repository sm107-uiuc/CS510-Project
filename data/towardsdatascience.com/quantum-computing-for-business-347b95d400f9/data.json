Moore\u2019s Law, roughly saying that the computing power doubles every two years, is slowly coming to an end, because of fundamental technological barriers related to further miniaturization. On the other hand, computers are operating linearly, processing task after task, and possible parallelization of calculations is limited by the Amdahl\u2019s law. Taking those two factors together means that approaching really hard real-life problems or simply really big data will need a shift of computing paradigm.", "Quantum computers are one of the potential solutions. They are operating on qubits, quantum bits, which themselves are affected by quantum effects like entanglement or superposition. This means that they can operate all together at the same time, hence omitting Amdahl\u2019s law. Moreover their power grows exponentially with the number of qubits, contrary to the linear nature of classical computers. Altogether this causes a well-deserved attention from both industry and academia. You might have seen articles describing a quantum future in terms of breaking any security code or password, as the computing power of quantum computers will inevitably surpass by far those of classical computers.", "We are not quite there yet. Despite all the recent hype, we are still before the quantum advantage, that is a practical demonstration that a quantum computer can solve a real-world problem much better than a classical computer. This means that you shouldn\u2019t expect that your business will be fully optimized thanks to quantum computers. Not right now at least. Is quantum computing a bogus then? Definitely not! It\u2019s just early in the process and, like always, there\u2019s a price you have to pay, a potential risk of bad investment, but also a reward once the technology will be more established.", "On the theoretical level different groups of researchers proved that certain quantum algorithms will provide an exponential speed-up over classical ones. However, they have all assumed having quantum computers with enough well-behaved qubits, which is not the current level of hardware. We are currently in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices era, or NISQ for short. Companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, D-Wave, Rigetti, IonQ are all trying to build their own NISQ devices. There was a plenty of progress in the recent years, which led to the creation of hardware with dozens of qubits and solving real-world problems, like optimizing taxi routes in a city or simulating molecules. Those solutions are imperfect and less optimal than those obtained on supercomputers, but they show a good trend \u2014 quantum computers are really getting to commercial level and it will happen sooner or later.", "Finding sub-optimal solutions is one of the reasons why all service providers in quantum space offer at this stage hybrid solutions which mix classical machine learning with quantum computing, e.g. 1QBit, Zapata or QxBranch. Some of the companies offer just services which work on simulators (quantum computing simulated on classical computers, cf. Atos, Xanadu or Microsoft at the moment) or on quantum-inspired hardware (Fujitsu Digital Annealer). Hybrid approach leads to interesting results in problems which scale quickly, like in logistics, or where you only have sparse data, like in predicting when a turbine will break down. These types of problems are impossible to solve well on classical computers and thus they serve as a good entry point for quantum computers, which offer different approach to computations and alternative, interesting solutions.", "We still need a couple of years to reach quantum advantage in different industries, but now is the best time to start experimenting with quantum. Quantum computers are completely different from classical computers and thus getting used to them is a process. Starting it right now will allow your company to be ready for the moment when quantum computing will be much more powerful than classical computing.", "My main reason for writing this text was summarizing the potential applications of quantum computing in the business world today. What you find below is a list of industries, where quantum computers are already used with the technology we have right now. I have given the examples of companies already experimenting, whenever there was a public information about it with a link available. I have only presented the largest enterprises, but there are already medium-sized companies who experiment with quantum to their benefit.", "This is just a tip of the iceberg. I have only described the largest enterprises and their ventures, and haven\u2019t mentioned vibrant start-up community or medium-sized companies already working in the field. Definitely quantum computing is the next big thing!", "If you have decided that you want to experiment with quantum computing within your organization, the best thing you can do is find a partner who can introduce you to the field. Currently there are dozens of start-ups and companies, which provide quantum computing services, either in niche business branches or in general. If you\u2019re looking for help, simply write me a message through social medias.", "If you want to read more about quantum space, here are some great overview articles:", "Good luck with your quantum journey!", "If you want to learn more, have a look at this list of books about Quantum Computing.", "Your home for data science.
