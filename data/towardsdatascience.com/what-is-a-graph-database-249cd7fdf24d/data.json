A graph is a type of structure and the underlying graph of a graph database maps the structure, or schema, of the data stored in the database.", "The picture below is a graph model for a seat booking database solution for a cinema. We would use such a schema to book seats to watch a film in a particular session at that cinema. I believe it can be readily said that graph schemas are straight forward to look at.", "Each line, or edge, with one or more arrows, represents a relationship or relation between what are called nodes or vertices and form what is called a directed graph. The type of model itself, has come to be known as a property graph schema. The property component of a property graph schema lends its name to where nodes and edges can have properties, as in Rating for the likes edge and Age for the Person node.", "NB In the graph theory of mathematics relationships need not be directed with one or more arrows, or have a reading (such as likes) so we take license here and have a bidirectional edge between Seat and Booking, because, let's face it, all relationships are bidirectional, and in this schema we use the bidirectional mapping to let us know that a Booking can be for many Seats and a Seat can be in many Bookings\u2026information not generally captured in a property graph schema in this way because graph schemas in common use are left wanting when it comes to the finer semantics of the underlying model.", "The edges with a large arrow and a small arrow let us know that the reading has a reciprocal reading stored in the schema in the software that this schema was generated on. E.g. Session is at Cinema may have a reciprocal reading Cinema hosts Session.", "Those relationships between nodes are what is used to navigate over the data in the database when querying the database. For instance, we might write a graph query that looks like the following:", "An advantage of viewing the schema of a database as a graph and querying the database as a graph is that the results of a query can also be viewed as a graph. In our example, the \u201cGreat Western Cinema\u201d hosts a session that has a booking that has a seat that is in a row that has row number 1\u2026viewed as \u20181 1\u2019 below because the row is in cinema 1, which is the Great Western Cinema in our example database. Similarly that row has bookings for seats \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 in that row, and so forth.", "Marketing material for graph databases generally claims that graph database are purpose built for graph processing. May be so, but in this article we challenge that \u2018purpose built\u2019 claim and ask the valid questions,", "- \u201cAre all databases graph databases?\u201d; and - \u201cCan all databases be queried with a graph query language?\u201d", "That is, we ask, \u201cWhat is a graph database?\u201d", "Without doubt there are databases that are purpose built for graph processing. Let us call these \u2018dedicated graph databases\u2019. To my mind, these are the least interesting of databases.", "If all databases can be viewed as a graph database, why limit yourself to graph processing?", "What other types of database processing is there?", "We arrive at the crux of this article. Vendors of graph databases often distinguish their products from the primary selling type of database called a \u2018relational database\u2019, otherwise they would just be selling a database.", "As the name suggests, a relational database is a database in which relationships matter. Rather than write a treatise on what a relational database looks like, let's just view the same schema of our example as an entity relationship diagram (ERD), which is the type of schema used to view the relationships of a relational database.", "The animation below goes back and forth between a property graph schema (PGS) and an entity relationship diagram to show that we are speaking of the same schema, just viewed differently.", "NB In mathematical terms, property graph schemas and entity relationship diagrams have a conceptual metamodel with a homomorphism that approaches an isomorphism.", "Because graph databases readily store predicate information for each relationship in the schema of the database, the database can be queried in a language which exploits the predicate information and which makes for queries which are easy to read.", "The following is an example of a graph query operating over our Cinema Bookings schema:", "The beauty of graph queries is not only that they are easy to read, they are easy to write. The query above is written in Knowledge Language (www.factengine.ai).", "Contrast this to how you would write the same query in the Structured Query Language generally used for relational databases:", "I propose that this is why graph databases and their query languages are popular. Viewing the result set as a graph is also convenient. Most graph databases will allow you to see the result in tabular format as well.", "We covered how graph databases map the schema of a database, and looked at how to query the data in a graph database. We have seen how data returned from a query over a graph database can be viewed in a tabular or graph fashion.", "So are you ready to race out and buy a graph database?", "Here is the thing. The schema, query and results in this article were all ranging over a relational database. The FactEngine initiative puts paid to the notion that you need a dedicated graph database to achieve the qualities of a graph database. Indeed, research shows that many graph queries perform faster on relational databases [1].", "I could now write an article then, \u201cWhat is a relational database?\u201d, but the converse is true\u2026every relational database is a graph database. So this article will suffice if you like the look and feel of graphs and graph queries.", "A database that supports relational and graph processing is called a multi-model database. The FactEngine thesis is that \u201cAll databases are multi-model\u2026\u201d and answering the question, \u201cWhat is a graph database?\u201d lands squarely with \u201cAll databases are graph databases, bar thinking different\u201d.", "This may be shocking to some, but it should not be controversial. With the right tools all databases are multi-model. That is, all databases can be viewed as a graph database and a relational database at the same time.", "You came here to find out what a graph database is, so let us define that realistically and to avoid confusion.", "\u201cA graph database is any database over which a graph schema and graph queries can be written\u201d. Simple.", "Dedicated graph databases may not be advantageous to your enterprise, business or personal application. A relational database may offer benefits peculiar to being a relational database and not covered by a dedicated graph database.", "As a consumer of product and information, I feel we need to be aware that most definitions of graph databases come from those who want to sell us a dedicated graph database. My job is to bring awareness that the definition of a graph database is what properties the database has, rather than who sells what to whom. Why race out and buy that graph database if you already have one?", "Thank you for reading. As time permits I will write more on graph databases, relational databases and multi-model databases. I hope this has been helpful in understanding what a graph database is and what a dedicated graph database is.", "Addendum: Since the publication of this article, the term \u201cRelational Knowledge Graph\u201d has surfaced, with many graph database vendors heading towards offering features of relational databases, and where the converse is also true. See \u201cWhat is a Relational Knowledge Graph?\u201d", "NB The original version of the model expressed in this article is copyright to Clifford Heath and Data Constellation, and is shared under the ActiveFacts project on GitHub: https://github.com/cjheath/activefacts.
