I say \u201cnormally distributed\u201d data because the mean is highly influenced by outliers.", "The mean adds up all the data values and divides by the total number of values, as follows:", "The \u2018x-bar\u2019 is used to represent the sample mean (the mean of a sample of data). \u2018\u2211\u2019 (sigma) implies de addition of all values up from \u2018i=1\u2019 until \u2018i=n\u2019 (\u2019n\u2019 is the number of data values). The result is then divided by \u2018n\u2019.", "The first plot ranges from 1 to 10. The mean is 5.5. When we replace 10 with 20, the average increases to 6.5. In the next concept, we will go over the \u2018median\u2019, that is the perfect choice to ignore outliers.", "This is the \u201cmiddle data point\u201d, where half of the data is below the median and half is above the median. It\u2019s the 50th percentile of the data (we will cover percentile later in this article). It\u2019s also mostly used with skewed data because outliers won\u2019t have a big effect on the median.", "There are two formulas to compute the median. The choice of which formula to use depends on n (number of data points in the sample, or sample size) if it\u2019s even or odd.", "When n is even, there is no \u201cmiddle\u201d data point, so the middle two values are averaged.", "When n is odd, the middle data point is the median.", "In the graph above, we are using the same data used to calculate the mean. Notice how the median stays the same in the second graph when we replace 10 with 20. It doesn\u2019t mean that the median will always ignore the outliers. If we had a larger number of numbers and/or outliers, the median could be affected, but the influence of an outlier is low.", "The mode will return you the most commonly occurring data value.", "R doesn\u2019t give you specifically the mean, but you can do the following to get the frequency of each data value: R: table(c('apple','banana','banana','tomato','orange','orange','banana')) The result is apple:1, banana:3, orange:2, tomato:1. \u2018Banana\u2019 has a higher frequency with 3 occurrences. Follows below a histogram plot of this fruit vector.", "The percent of data that is equal to or less than a given data point. It\u2019s useful for describing where a data point stands within the data set. If the percentile is close to zero, then the observation is one of the smallest. If the percentile is close to 100, then the data point is one o the largest in the data set.", "Quartiles measure the center and it\u2019s also great to describe the spread of the data. Highly useful for skewed data. There are four quartiles, and they compose the five-number summary (combined with the minimum). The Five-number summary is composed of:", "A boxplot is one good way to plot the five-number summary and explore the data set.", "The bottom end of the boxplot represents the minimum; the first horizontal line represents the lower quartile; the line inside the square is the median; the next line is the upper quartile, and the top is the maximum.", "Standard deviation is extensively used in statistics and data science. It measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a data set, calculating how spread out the data are from the mean. Small values mean the data is consistent and close to the mean. Larger values indicate the data is highly variable.", "Deviation: The idea is to use the mean as a reference point from which everything varies. A deviation is defined as the distance an observation lies from the reference point. This distance is obtained by subtracting the data point (xi) from the mean (x-bar).", "Calculating the standard deviation: The average of all the deviations will always turn out to be zero, so we square each deviation and sum up the results. Then, we divide it for \u2018n-1\u2019 (called degrees of freedom). We square root the final result to undo de squaring of the deviations.", "The standard deviation is a representation of all deviations in the data. It\u2019s never negative and it\u2019s zero only if all the values are the same.", "This graph shows the density of Sepal.Width from the Iris data set. The standard deviation is 0.436. The blue line represents the mean, and the red lines one and two standard deviations away from the mean. For example, a Sepal.Width with a value of 3.5 lies 1 standard deviation from the mean.", "Effect of outliers: The standard deviation, like the mean, is highly influenced by outliers. The code below will use R to compare the standard deviation of two vectors, one without outliers and a second with an outlier.", "Variance is almost the same calculation of the standard deviation, but it stays in squared units. So, if you take the square root of the variance, you have the standard deviation.", "Note that it\u2019s represented by \u2018s-squared\u2019, while the standard deviation is represented by \u2018s\u2019.", "The difference between the maximum and minimum values. Useful for some basic exploratory analysis, but not as powerful as the standard deviation.", "It\u2019s often referred to as \u201cpercentage\u201d. Defines the percent of observations in the data set that satisfy some requirements.", "Defines the strength and direction of the association between two quantitative variables. It ranges between -1 and 1. Positive correlations mean that one variable increases as the other variable increases. Negative correlations mean that one variable decreases as the other increases. When the correlation is zero, there is no correlation at all. As closest to one of the extreme the result is, stronger is the association between the two variables.", "The graph is showing the correlation in the mtcars data set, between MPG and Weight (-0.87). This is a strong negative correlation, meaning that as the weight increases, the MPG decreases.", "These basic summaries are essential as you explore and analyze your data. They are the foundations to dive deeper into statistics and work on advanced analytics.
