That\u2019s no surprise \u2014 in a field changing as quickly as this one, google has the miraculous power to find incredible resources at the click of a mouse. Unfortunately, however, Google can also fish up a lot of outdated, poorly written, or just wrong information. How to make sense of what you find, and what should you rely on? In this little note, first written for students, I take a look at what google\u2019s net catches in a search on machine learning, what should be kept, and what should be thrown back.", "The first type of reference material to watch for is books. Yes, they are old fashioned, they can be expensive, and they are usually a few years behind the cutting edge, but a carefully written book by a real expert is a precious thing. In this field, there are a few books that are referenced all the time; as source material, I treat them as my gold standard:", "Finally, no one working in any computer-related field would survive long without the O\u2019Reilly library of books. That\u2019s where I go if I want to learn a new language, get an introduction to an important tool, or improve my programming skills in a particular area. I can see five or six O\u2019Reilly books on the shelf right above my head as I type this. I\u2019m fortunate to be at a University whose library subscribes to the OReilly library, so I have access to their entire catalog. If you are not so fortunate, you might have to actually buy the books, or pay a subscription fee, to get full access to their catalog.", "Next, we have published scholarly articles from journals or conference proceedings. In a google search, such articles are typically labelled by the conference or journal \u2014 for example, when I google search for \u201ctsne paper\u201d the first hit is for the original van der Maaten paper and it\u2019s labelled \u201cJournal of Machine Learning Research\u201d where the article first appeared.", "In academia, a scholarly article published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings is considered to have the stamp of approval of the profession. Typically, such publications are quite condensed and technical, but they are more current than books and sometimes give details that are not available elsewhere. Unfortunately, there are so many journals and so many conferences that being published is not always a reliable indicator of quality. It\u2019s important to take some note of WHERE the publication appeared.", "For example, a premiere conference in neural networks is NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems). The paper ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Krizhevsky, Suskever, and Hinton, which demonstrated the feasibility of training huge neural networks to do image classification on a massive scale, appeared in the NIPS proceedings in 2012. This paper has 55500 citations on google scholar, or roughly 7000 per year since publication. That tells you how influential that work has been, but it\u2019s also a little alarming \u2014 what are these 55500 OTHER papers that have cited it in the past 8 years? Can they all be worth reading?", "Another important journal in the field is The Journal of Machine Learning Research. JMLR published Visualizing Data with t-SNE in 2008; that paper has \u2018only\u2019 had 11500 citations since then.", "There are many other excellent journals and conference proceedings; for example, the STOC and FOCS conferences in Computer Science and the journals published by the major professional societies such as the IEEE, the American Statistical Association and the American Mathematical Society. And it\u2019s also the case that important work can be published in relatively obscure places. So don\u2019t be a snob and rule something out just because of where it was published; but do bear in mind that just because something is published doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s interesting, or even correct.", "The next place that turns up in Google searches is the arxiv. The arxiv is a preprint server. That means that people working in a scientific field can post their work on the arxiv server before it is accepted for publication in a journal or conference \u2014 because the review process for acceptance can take a long time. The arxiv is very current and nearly every important paper appears there before it appears in a formal publication. However, the barrier to posting something there is quite low and there is a flood of material. For example, a search for neural networks revealed something like 75 new publications in a two day period so it\u2019s easy to get buried.", "After these three more formal venues \u2014 books, journals and conferences, and preprints \u2014 comes the more informal part of the literature ecosystem. This contains blog posts, tutorials, and self-published articles. This note is one such informal contribution; Medium hosts many such. Within Medium itself are sub-aggregators that carry their own brand, such as TowardsDataScience. The articles that appear in this format can be very useful; for example, they may include very practical, step by step instructions on particular tasks. I found this article on the python visualization tool Bokeh very helpful and clearly written and I am grateful to its author for the obvious time and effort he put into it. I have come across other articles that are, to be tactful, less well written and less useful.", "One important part of the informal ecosystem that comes up in searches is course notes from university courses. Some of these are pure gold \u2014 for example, the notes to the famous Stanford CS229 course are posted, including samples of student projects done for that course going back years.", "We\u2019re almost done. There are two more things that you\u2019ll find in your google search that may help you learn what you are trying to learn. The first is, perhaps obvious \u2014 code and its documentation. Here GitHub and the other repositories are a huge gift to the community because you can not only get direct access to the detailed documentation and tutorials for such essential tools as tensorflow, keras, pytorch, scikit-learn, R, and on and on and on\u2026 but you can even read the code to see how these important tools work.", "To give a concrete example, at one point I wanted to learn how to scrape data from twitter. I googled \u201cscrape twitter data python\u201d and found the blog post How to Scrape Tweets from Twitter. That, in turn, referred me to the package Tweepy, where I could read the documentation and also look at the tweepy github repository to see the source code.", "And, finally, there are MOOCS. Coursera and Udemy are two of the big MOOC providers; they are good examples because they operate along different lines. Coursera courses are developed with universities and are typically taught by faculty. Udemy is more of a marketplace, hosting courses written by others; the authors get a share of the money Udemy collects when people sign up for a course. The bottom line is that some of these MOOCS are excellent \u2014 I completed Andrew Ng\u2019s sequence on neural networks through Coursera and it was terrific \u2014 but some are not; they can vary wildly in price; and they aren\u2019t ideal for learning about that one thing that started you on your google expedition in the first place.", "I think that about covers it. I hope this review of the \u201cgooglable\u201d literature is helpful to you the next time you try to track down that one piece of information you need for whatever project you are involved in.
