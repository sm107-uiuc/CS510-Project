This article follow-ups on the original article by further explaining the other two common approaches in feature selection for Machine Learning (ML) \u2014 namely the wrapper and embedded methods. Explanations will be accompanied by sample coding in Python.", "To recap, feature selection means to reduce the number of predictors used to train a ML model. The main goals are to improve the accuracy of the predictive performance (by reducing the number of redundant predictors), reduce calculation time (fewer predictors, less time needed to compute), and to improve the interpretability of the model (easier to study the dependency of predictors when the number is smaller). Filter method, which is based on statistical technique can be generally applied independently of the algorithms used for a ML model. However, wrapper and embedded methods are normally \u201cfine-tuned\u201d to optimize the classifier performance, making them ideal if the goal is to objectively find out an ideal set of predictors for a specific learning algorithm or model.", "Wrapper methods evaluate multiple models using procedures that add and/or remove predictors to find the optimal combination that maximizes model performance. [1] These procedures are normally built after the concept of Greedy Search technique (or algorithm). [2] A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.[3]", "Generally, three directions of procedures are possible:", "There are two popular libraries in Python which can be used to perform wrapper style feature selection \u2014 Sequential Feature Selector from mlxtend and Recursive Feature Elimination from Scikit-learn.", "The complete Python codes can be found on Github. The data used are the Boston house-prices dataset from Scikit-learn.", "SequentialFeatureSelector() class accepts the following major parameters:", "For other possible parameters, please refer to the documentation.", "2. Backward elimination \u2014 RFE() from Sklearn", "RFE(estimator, n_features_to_select) is a class which stands for Reursive Feature Elimination is derived from the commonly used sklearn library for machine learning algorithms, it accepts the following major parameters :", "For other possible parameters, please refer to the documentation.", "3. Step-wise Selection \u2014 SFFS() from mlxtend", "Similar to the class used in 1. Forward Selection, the parameters used are the same, with the exception:", "Bonus \u2014 What is the ideal number of features?", "In the last 3 examples, the number of features assigned to k_features is set at 5. But how are we supposed to know if 5 is the best number? Fortunately, in the same mlxtend library, it is possible to use the plot_sequential_feature_selection class to visualize the scoring to make the decision easier. For more details, please refer to the documentation.", "As seen in the graph, the performance peaks at 7 features with 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5). Not to be confused with the negative signs for performance, neg_mean_squared_error simply multiplies the result of mean squared error (MSE) with -1 just to follow the convention of that sklearn. The idea is that minimizing MSE is equivalent to maximizing negative-MSE.", "The main difference between Filter and Wrapper methods is the dependency on the learning algorithm. By observing the red boxes, filter methods can be carried out statistically without prior knowledge of the learning algorithm. Wrapper methods, on the other hand, select features iteratively based on the estimator used in the learning algorithm. They are like a double-edged sword, the features selected will be best suited for the chosen algorithm but may not fit well in another algorithm. Wrapper methods are also more prone to over-fitting as it involves training with several sets of features combinations. As wrapper methods use cross-validation to select the best subset of features, this process can be computationally-expensive. The pros and cons of wrapper methods can be summarised as:", "The article covers the second approach in feature selection \u2014 wrapper methods using ML algorithms. In the next article, we will look into the last approach, a.k.a. embedded methods.
