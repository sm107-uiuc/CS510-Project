You really wanted to find that restaurant.", "You are driving your car around a curve and it tells you that you are not fully in the lane when you can obviously see you\u2019re doing just fine.", "You go to the doctor and later receive a message from your insurance company that they will not cover the care you were given. You soon discover that \u201csomeone\u201d in the office did not pick the right diagnostic code (There were 155,000 possible codes as of 2018). The office says a new automated system is in place which will read the doctors notes electronically and will prevent these issues in the future. You are less than convinced.", "How did this happen? Did the magic of Artificial/Augmented Intelligence (AI) fail? Or more likely, did the army of data serfs who labelled the restaurant data or the images of the lines on the road or the medical diagnostic codes showed up tired that day and even those responsible for validating the labelling (another data serf task) missed the errors. When it comes to medical codes, estimates are that only 63% of the coding may be accurate.", "While advances in artificial or augmented intelligence have been accelerated as more and more data is labelled and while the costs of intensive computing in complex machine models have been alleviated for the most part by new hardware devices and open source models, when you dig into why so many predictions for future advancements in AI lag expectations the answer is often, \u201cit\u2019s the data, stupid\u201d.", "As we advance in a greater understanding of the requirements for labelled datasets the bias of the labeler (still a human) also needs to be taken into account as well as the actual cost of the labelling process. Pricing for labelling can range from $10 to $1000 for 1,000 units (or between 10 cents and a dollar for each item) and can vary by the number of redundant human labelers. When you dig into the data even more as Robert Munro did in this article and you discover that while the car may be \u201chers\u201d it is more likely labelled \u201chis\u201d, because \u201cmasculine pronouns are 3x and 4x more frequent than feminine pronouns respectively in each dataset\u201d, then you begin to realize that not all errors due to bias may even be seen initially as errors.", "As part of the process of building and tuning your machine learning model, you decide to spend the money to get your data labelled by one of the data labelling companies, some like Hive boasting over 1.5 million workers. When you compare the Hive headcount (temporary or not) to Amazon with ~700,000 and Walmart with ~2.2 million, the scale of the work required becomes clearer. In 2019, The Economist quoted a prediction that \u201cthe market for data-labelling services may triple to $5bn by 2023\u201d. If you hire one company label data to build your initial models, should you hire the same company to validate the data labelling (whether it\u2019s simple entry verification or to determine if the model is acting as expected in the real world)? Should you hire your own data validation team? Are there ways that this validation can be automated? To compare what was predicted to what actually happened? Or does this accuracy not matter?", "What if instead the story about drifting out of lanes was not about driver notification, but about a self-driving tractor trailer truck straying into your lane?", "The requirements for augmented intelligence, where actionable data is provided so a human can intervene, differ from true artificial intelligence where a device or vehicle is expected to act autonomously. Most augmented intelligence is dependent on large volumes of accurately labelled data. So perhaps the real frontier today in AI is scaled automation of data labelling and validation, which may lower cost or improve context, rather than more even more complex models?", "It seems clear that greater accuracy of prediction and/or much greater contextual understanding will be required to reach true artificial intelligence in the form of autonomous vehicles or devices operating in the same realm as living things. In the meantime, the companies to watch may not be the ones with slickest demo, but the ones who are working on solutions for scaled labelled data specific to their expert domains.", "Your home for data science.
