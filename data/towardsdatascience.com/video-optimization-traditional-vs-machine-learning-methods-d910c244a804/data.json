The most common method is compression, which makes it possible to store and deliver rich media, such as images and video, while conserving network bandwidth and storage. Video compression is not new, and traditional algorithms have achieved impressive performance. However, new machine learning methods have the potential to improve video compression even further.", "Here are a few popular techniques used to compress video while retaining reasonable quality.", "Video compression algorithms look for spatial and temporal redundancy. They can reduce file size by identifying duplicate data and encoding it fewer times. For example, imagine a one-minute scene in which a character\u2019s expression slowly changes. It makes no sense to encode the background image frame by frame. Instead, you can encode it once and then refer back to it until the video frame changes.", "Video encoding schemes use three key concepts:", "The P frame only needs to store visual information that is unique to that frame. The B frame identifies the P frame and the next I frame and average motion across the P-frame that preceded it and the I-frame that follows it. Essentially, the algorithm knows where an image starts and ends \u2014 and encodes both using I-frames. In the interim, it makes good guesses using partial data, represented as P- and B-frames.", "There is a downside to this technique \u2014 inter-frame predictive coding results in unsightly artifacts in video frames. Parts of the image might move incorrectly due to imperfect encoding.", "A common compression technique is to adjust or reduce resolution. This is because the higher the video resolution, the more information each frame will contain. For example, assuming I-frames are used, each frame of 1280x720 video can include almost a million pixels, while a 640x360 video has only a fifth the number of pixels.", "Therefore, an effective way to save data is to reduce image size and then sample again. This reduces the number of pixels, reduces the level of detail in the image, and reduces the size of the image.", "This concept is the basis for adaptive bitrate streaming. This is the process of setting different quality levels for a video, each using a different resolution, and adjusting the bitrate depending on the current bandwidth available to the user.", "Another way to compress videos is to adjust frames per second (FPS). Lowering FPS dramatically reduces the amount of data needed to view the video. However, this is more destructive than other methods. Reducing the frame rate hurts quality, making the video choppy and less fluid.", "Creating and improving compression tools requires a lot of expertise, energy, and time. Integrating machine learning into this process can simplify and accelerate the creation of compression algorithms.", "Today, it is possible to automate codec creation using machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning methods can be used to learn the best parameters for the codec, and reinforcement learning can be used to continuously improve codecs and compression parameters with minimal effort.", "Unsupervised learning algorithms are also useful for encoding. They can identify clusters of similar video frames, even if they are not in sequence, to allow additional opportunities for compression through temporal similarity.", "Machine learning methods not only save time, but can also result in more effective codecs and greater compression ratios than those achievable by human tuning.", "Here are a few ways machine learning is being used to improve video compression and optimization.", "Lossy image and video codecs are widely used in compression. Neural network architectures, particularly CNNs, have been shown to be very effective in improving codec efficiency. CNNs can be used for:", "An example of a CNN-based codec improvement framework is the paper by Jiang, Tao et. al (2017).", "Machine learning methods for image compression have mainly focused on lossy compression. A common framework is to obtain a more compact version of an image by applying quantization to an auto-encoder bottleneck. For bitrate streaming use cases, the model can analyze errors progressively, using several auto-encoders. Progressive encoding can add more bits after downsampling, reconstructing the image and improving quality.", "An example of a neural network model for lossy image compression, based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), is the paper by Johnson, Vincent, et. al. (2017).", "The use of machine learning algorithms is already reducing development time and cost of video codecs, and will greatly accelerate the development of video compression in the future. Custom compression methods will become commonplace, and improved performance will make it easier to meet the growing demand for high quality video on low-bandwidth, limited-storage connected devices.", "Your home for data science.
