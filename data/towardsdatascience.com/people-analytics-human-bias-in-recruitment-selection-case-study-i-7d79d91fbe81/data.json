Now, it wants to incorporate a People Analyst as part of its new strategy to keep on scaling its business while maintaining an accurate hiring process that will positively contribute to future company-decisions. As the new People Analyst, you take the lead to start exploring, in quantitative terms, the hiring process of this fast-growing company.", "The first step of this new task is collecting employee data from this company in terms of its hiring process, from the applicant pool to those who finally joined XYZ.", "The data presents 280 observations and 9 variables. These variables indicate:", "Note. The data of this article is taken from the book \u201cPredictive HR Analytics\u201d by Martin R Edwards & Kirsten Edwards, case study 5, example 1.", "The next step is to understand the data we have. All the variables are categorical, so we can only work with their frequencies to carry out further statistical analysis. Let\u2019s start by coding the dummy variables into factors.", "Now, we can start analyzing the different variables in terms of their frequencies. Before diving into deeper analysis, let\u2019s have a quick look at these variables frequencies.", "In short, 280 people applied for a job, 88 of them were shortlisted (31%), 55 had an interview (20%), 28 had an offer (51% out of those who had an interview), and 18 finally joined the company XYZ (64% of those who had an initial offer to join). In this article, we will focus on exploring the plausible relationship between applicants\u2019 gender and applicants being shortlisted.", "The applicant pool was composed of 202 (72%) females and 78 (28%) males. Clearly, more females applied for a job at XYZ than males. A key question that we want to explore is whether the proportion of females and males in the applicant pool was representative of these groups that were shortlisted. If we find a similar proportion of males (28%) and females (72%), then this finding will not suggest evidence of any gender bias. Let\u2019s create a contingency table and some graphs to shed light on this fundamental question.", "Wow! The results are very tangible. Looking at the contingency table and Figure 2, we see that whereas 43% of males were shortlisted, only 57% of females were considered to go through the next stage of the hiring process. Additionally, the total number of males and females applicants that were shortlisted is presented in Figure 3. Just by having a glimpse to it, we see that there was approximately an equal proportion between males being rejected and shortlisted. However, when looking at females, the proportion of those who were rejected was considerably greater than those who were shortlisted.", "At this point, our analysis provides some evidence that there might be a male-leaning preference in the shortlisting process. Nevertheless, at this stage, we can not reject that the above results could have occurred by chance alone. Let\u2019s carry out a chi-square test to see whether our findings are significant or not.", "> The chi-square test consists of analyzing whether there is a relation between two categorical variables (e.g., is applicants\u2019 gender related to applicants being shortlisted?). With this test, we basically compare the frequencies of our categorical variables that we observe to the ones we might expect to get in those categories by chance. <", "Before drawing any conclusions, we have to make sure that we are not violating any assumptions for running the chi-square with the data we have. We need to ensure that our variables are independent and that we have no expected values below 5.", "The assumption of independence is very straightforward, for the chi-square to be meaningful each applicant must contribute to only one cell of the contingency table. Looking back at our contingency table, we had applicants that were either male or female and that were either rejected or shortlisted, so independence = \u2713.", "The second assumption refers to our categorical variables presenting values equal to or more than 5. Basically, we could calculate each of the expected frequencies for the four cells of our contingency table as follows (where row total and column total are abbreviated to RT and CT, respectively)", "Fortunately, R can do the rest of the 3 expected counts for us.", "As we can see, the lowest value is 24.51 so we can have another check mark for our second assumption, chi-square expected values = \u2713.", "Now, we can check the chi-square result.", "The result is highly significant at the p < .001*** meaning that there is an association between applicants\u2019 gender and applicants being shortlisted. However, the chi-square result cannot tell us which cell is contributing the most to this association, for checking this we need to look at the chi-square standardized residuals.", "Without going too much deep into statistics, standardized residuals are z-scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. By knowing this, we can assess the significance of each cell value as follows:", "By looking at the chi-square residuals, the only significant cell value is the one Male_Shortlisted (2.72, p < .01**). Therefore, we can be certain that the differences in applicants\u2019 gender being shortlisted are due to the high proportion of males being shortlisted as compared to females.", "The last step in our gender analysis is calculating the effect size. To do so, we are going to calculate the odds ratio of our data. The odds ratio is a very simple and straightforward metric for expressing the effect size of categorical data. It is most interpretable in focused comparison (i.e., 2 x 2 contingency tables like the one in our case).", "To calculate it, we simply first calculate the odds that an applicant was rejected given that he was male, divided by the number of females who were rejected.", "Next, we calculate the odds that an applicant was shortlisted given that he was male, divided by the number of females who were shortlisted.", "The last calculation is simply dividing odds_gender_rejected by odds_gender_shortlisted.", "You can also calculate the odds ratio as follows using the function odd.ratio from the package questionr.", "This result tells us that if an applicant\u2019s gender was male, the odds of he being shortlisted was .35 times higher than if an applicant\u2019s gender was female. Another way to say this is that the odds of an applicant being shortlisted was 1/.35 = 2.8 times lower if an appliant\u2019s gender was female than if an applicant\u2019s gender was male.", "Now, we can base our conclusions on our statistical analysis. We could say:", "The highly significant result of the chi-square indicates that there was a significant association between applicants\u2019 gender and applicants being shortlisted or not. The result is significant at p < .001, meaning that there is less than a 1 in a 1,000 chance that we would find the above association by chance alone. From the standardized residuals the cell \u2018males shortlisted\u2019 was the only significant one contributing to the differences in the chi-square results, hence the differences in applicants being shortlisted. The odds ratio shows that the odds of applicants being shortlisted were .35 times higher if they were males than if they were females.", "Based on the results from our gender analysis, we have evidence that there was a male-preference in the shortlisting process of the company XYZ. Nevertheless, although the chi-square result is statistically significant, we would have to carry out further analysis before we can argue any kind of gender bias in the hiring process. Perhaps, male applicants were stronger candidates than females, however, all things being equal we would not expect this pattern. Additionally, applicants\u2019 individual differences such as their age or personality might be playing a significant role in our findings, as previous research has already demonstrated the importance of these variables in human bias when it comes to recruiting and selecting employees.", "Edwards, M.
