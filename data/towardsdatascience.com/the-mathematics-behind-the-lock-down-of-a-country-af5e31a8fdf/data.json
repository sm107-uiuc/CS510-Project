So over time, you are able to identify your location. This is a distribution \u2014 and, hence, you can understand the variation in the estimates that otherwise would\u2019ve been reduced to a single point.", "The earlier section looked at stating problems in Bayesian terms.

Only the contact rate changes.", "The switch-points are set as discrete uniform priors \u2014 meaning they can only take discrete values ranging from 1 to the last day of the data, each day with an equal probability.", "With these priors, we can fit the model using the Poisson distribution, as the data we\u2019re dealing with is the raw count data.", "Considering we\u2019re working with close to 50 days of data, I\u2019ve isolated the most recent 10% of data for validation.

The first time I saw this, it kinda shook me.", "The lock-down seems to have worked!", "Given that we extracted data from the 2nd of March, this puts the following in perspective:", "From the below graph, we can see that most results are bi-modal. This means that there are two points of convergence \u2014 the bars in the histograms peak at particular points, specifically two. This could be because of the wide diaspora that lies within the vast Indian subcontinent. Each state has its own position towards the crisis at hand.", "This insight leaves me excited to understand, and analyze further, the data for the states in this country. There are multiple applications for analysis of this nature, and I am planning to take one up each week or so. So, stay tuned for those updates!", "At the end of this analysis, I am left with mixed feelings. A quote from Arundhati Roy\u2019s recent piece of writing comes to mind.", "Who among us is not a quack epidemiologist, virologist, statistician and prophet?", "I do want to advocate this analysis. There are enough reasons to do so. A recent study by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in India concluded that the effects of flattening began showing on the 6th of April. These are in-line with the estimates above.The period of infection and R\u2080 is within bounds of what has been reported in the Indian media.A prominent economist has also identified with these findings, albeit with a different approach, and this has been presented to the Government of India as of the 24th of April.", "Yet, the model has caveats. Nowhere is the system accounting for asymptomatic individuals. Nowhere is the system accounting for incubation periods. We assume a homogeneous population.", "Further, India has been criticized for not conducting enough tests. If correct, the implications of not conducting enough tests could mean all projections and insights to be untrue. After all, the model is fit on the data that is available.", "As for making decisions based on the output of this model, I\u2019d advice against it.
