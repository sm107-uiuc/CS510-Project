This happens every day to all of us. I think it is vital to illustrate how easy it is. I will share some funny experiences and show evidence of the bot infestation on Twitter.", "The latter part of the article describes in great depth the code and the functionalities of the bot. The current production code is available on Github. I run the bot on AWS and deployed it via the Serverless framework. It is not even using 5% of the monthly AWS free tier. So give it a try.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this article is going to get my Twitter account banned. But hey, Yolo!", "I started writing on Medium about six weeks ago. I wanted to write articles that would help people get their hands dirty with Python and, generally speaking, broaden their skillset. The reason for this is that some of my team members wanted to learn Python, and I figured there might be synergies here. When I started, I said to myself that I\u2019d do this for about two months to see what will come out of it. If worst came to worst, I\u2019d have some nicely structured articles that I can use to teach Python. I am convinced that almost every single person out there can benefit from knowing some Python.", "I wrote my first article on cohorts. I did not research whether people care about the topic. Frankly, I didn\u2019t care. I had no clue how to format Medium articles properly, didn\u2019t even know that you could include pictures initially. I just wanted to get started, and this was a topic where I had done some work recently.", "Viewer numbers were ridiculously low, like a measly 30 views per day or so. Then the article got featured in the columns Data Science and Programming, and shortly after, the publication Better Programming distributed it. Viewer numbers \u201csky-rocketed.\u201d At least by my standards back then.", "When you have never seen a building, even a one-story house looks like a sykscraper", "I was up to like 150 views per day. It felt good. That was the moment I set an ambitious target. I wanted to write articles that would have 100.000 views over a rolling 30-day window. An arbitrary number really, but explicit and ambitious goals help not to lose focus. I said to myself I would publish at least one article a week. I write at night, between 9 pm and 11 pm, and on the weekends. Sometimes it\u2019s challenging, but I keep going.", "The second article was much better in terms of viewer numbers. Towards Data Science had spotted the story, and since I love the publication, I did not hesitate to publish there. Maybe the topic was a bit more relevant. Who knows. It doesn\u2019t matter. I was moving in the right direction.", "Introducing Twitter! My third article was a follow-up piece to the second article. It included a somewhat advanced visualization. I published it on a Friday night, which I knew was not perfect, but I had no time to finish it earlier. And after all, I had to meet my goals. Then something weird happened. My viewer numbers exploded. On Sunday alone, the article had generated 4000 views. I was astounded. I had to understand this, so I started looking into potential causes. After some digging, I found this:", "I hadn\u2019t thought of Twitter as a proper distribution channel for Medium pieces, but there was no denying the effect it had. If Kirk can do this, I can certainly do this, too, I thought. So I dusted off the account I had created to follow Donald Trump for the occasional laugh. Only one problem, the account had precisely zero followers.", "I started posting on Twitter, liking tweets, retweeting, and following people. Ohh my this was tiring. I quickly realized that Twitter is like a crazy bazaar where everyone keeps blurting out their ideas and opinions through a bullhorn with insane frequency. I am in marketing and did some research on the recommended level of activity on Twitter, and it\u2019s simply nuts. Some sources suggest up to 20 posts a day, others even more. I haven\u2019t counted, but I think Kirk is probably somewhere around 200 a day.", "After a day or so of doing this manually, I was annoyed out of my mind. I decided that I needed a different approach here. The fact that my followers had gone up by precisely one didn\u2019t help my motivation.", "My activities on Twitter were mind-numbingly repetitive. From what Kirk was doing, it also didn\u2019t exactly seem like he was reading everything that he was posting about. And whenever something is done over and over again, it\u2019s typically a prime candidate for automation. I found tweepy, a Python library to access the Twitter API. The documentation looked clean, and the code well maintained. I wanted to give this a try.", "Setting up authentication and obtaining credentials was surprisingly easy:", "I tested the credentials in a Jupyter Notebook with a simple API call, and everything seemed to work just fine. Now it was time to take it to the next level. My bot was supposed to do two things:", "From an experiment with an Instagram bot years ago, I knew the exact recipe to achieve my first objective. It\u2019s relatively unethical because it plays into humans\u2019 desire to be liked and to get recognition. And it is as fake as it gets. But then again, this is Twitter. Also, I think it is essential to talk about these practices. It is crucial to demonstrate how and that they work. It is critical to show that they are being used every day on a much larger scale.", "The way it works \u2014 Give people recognition and attention:", "So leaving all ethical aspects aside, lets code this up.", "In my projects, I tend to use a config module as an abstraction layer to my configuration settings.", "The config would look like this:", "We can then set up a module to provide the Twitter API like this:", "The following piece of code contains the interaction logic.", "We start with two all-cap variables, COMMENTS and HASHTAG_SETS those will be referenced later on, given the content and the names, the usage is fairly obvious. The COMMENTS list holds a selection of generic positive comments, the HASHTAG_SETS holds a list of different hashtag combinations to be used for searches.", "The primary function is fetchfollow, which does the following:", "This phase is rather funny. This phase is the time when you release your bot into the wild and observe the results. Sometimes with amusement, sometimes with bewilderment. When I experimented with the Instagram bot back in the day, I quickly learned that there is quite some porn on Instagram. But that\u2019s a story for another day.", "After deploying the first version of the Twitter bot, I learned three things:", "\u24d0 I had to tweak the way in which I was searching for tweets as I initially only searched for Python.", "\u24d1 I had to adjust the frequency the bot was running and make the behavior less deterministic. The first version of the bot got blocked pretty quickly because I was machinegun commenting and spreading the likes around like the squirrel from Ice Age after having an energy drink.", "However, it was quite easy to create a new app and take a more cautious approach this time.", "\u24d2 There are a whole lot of bots on Twitter. I got the response, \u201cHey, thanks for following me. Check this great service that I am using: https://xxxbots.xx\u201d quite often. Kudos to them. They run a smart viral marketing approach.", "Over the last four weeks, my Twitter account has accumulated roughly 600 followers without me doing anything other than occasionally adding a new entry to the list of Medium posts.", "Since you don\u2019t want to blow the number of people you are following up too much, you have to unfollow people every now and then to keep a balance.", "The unfollow function, when executed, fetches the previously uploaded following_history and sorts all the ones that have not been unfollowed by ascending follow date. For the first one to three users, it is going to call destroy_friendship (which invokes the unfollow). Apt name if you ask me. It will update following_history and then be ready to be called again.", "This part is straight forward and the morality of it certainly less questionable.", "This script posts a random article out of the reference list. The reference list looks like this:", "I used the Serverless framework to deploy the bot to AWS utilizing Lambda functions and a predefined schedule (specified in the serverless.yml)", "Setup is quite easy, but explaining Serverless would be another article altogether. Updating the bot requires me to make some changes to the script and then run serverless deploy.", "I will have the bot run for some more time so that people reading the article can have a live reference. I\u2019ll ultimately shut it down, though.", "Please connect on LinkedIn if you want to have a chat! I\u2019d love to have a conversation or answer any questions that you might have.", "Check out the other articles I wrote on Medium and leave a clap or two if you liked the article.", "Your home for data science.
