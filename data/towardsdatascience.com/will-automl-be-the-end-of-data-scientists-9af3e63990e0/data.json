recently, AutoML has exploded in popularity, with all the big tech players entering the space.", "In April 2016, Facebook declared that AutoML was a \u201cbackbone\u201d of its AI. In January 2018, Google announced Cloud AutoML. In August 2018, Salesforce open-sourced its Einstein AutoML library. A month later, Microsoft introduced AutoML to its Azure AI platform. Earlier this year, Amazon introduced AutoGluon, another open-source AutoML toolkit.", "CB Insights lists over 40 AutoML companies today, though there are surely far more. Here are just a few:", "Accern, Aible, AIgatha, Aito, Amenity Analytics, Auger, BACC, beynd, causaLens, CybordIntell, DarwinAI, DeepBlue Technology, Determined AI, dotData, Edge, Evolv Technologies, Explorium, Feedzai, Figure Technologies, Flywheel, H2O.ai, henQ, Hiretual, Industrial Analytics, Inspur Group, Intento, MAANA, Marlabs, MindsDB, Monitor, Moorfields Eye Hospital, Node, Plataine, Qeexo, Redpepper, Risk Ledger, Servian, Sittercity, Stack Data, Stratifyd, and The SmartHUB.", "If we look to places like YCombinator\u2019s Startup School forum, /r/startups, or even just Twitter, we\u2019ll find that founders are churning out new AutoML and no-code AI projects like there\u2019s no tomorrow.", "It\u2019s worth noting the difference between \u201cno-code AI\u201d and autoML. AutoML is typically either no-code or low-code, but there are also code-heavy or technologically complex autoML solutions, like Auto-WEKA (check out its intense 15-page manual.)", "No-code AI and analytics solutions like Apteo aim to simplify autoML as much as possible, removing any technical barriers to entry.", "There\u2019s a good reason for all the AutoML hype: AutoML is a must-have for many organizations.", "Let\u2019s take the example of Salesforce. They explain that their \u201ccustomers are looking to predict a host of outcomes \u2014 from customer churn, sales forecasts and lead conversions to email marketing click throughs, website purchases, offer acceptances, equipment failures, late payments, and much more.\u201d", "In short, ML is ubiquitous. However, for ML to be effective for each unique customer, they would \u201chave to build and deploy thousands of personalized machine learning models trained on each individual customer\u2019s data for every single use case\u201d and \u201cthe only way to achieve this without hiring an army of data scientists is through automation.\u201d", "While many people see AutoML as a way to bring ease-of-use and efficiency to ML, the reality is that for many enterprise applications, there\u2019s just no other way to do it. A company like Facebook or Salesforce or Google can\u2019t hire data scientists to build custom models for each of their billions of users, so they automate ML instead, enabling unique models at scale.", "The amount of ML components that are automated depends on the platform, but with Salesforce, it includes feature inference, automated feature engineering, automated feature validation, automated model selection, and hyperparameter optimization.", "What this means is that data scientists can deploy thousands of models in production, with far less grunt work and hand-tuning, reducing turn-around-time drastically.", "By shifting the work from data crunching towards more meaningful analytics, AutoML enables more creative, business-focused applications of data science.", "Given the proliferation of cheap, efficient, and simple AutoML tools, we might expect that AutoML will replace data scientists.", "To preface these shortcomings, note that they\u2019re not related to the accuracy or usability of AutoML.", "For instance, some claim that AutoML can\u2019t handle Reinforcement Learning, which is disproven by the example of AlphaZero, a model that started without domain knowledge and reached a superhuman level playing itself.", "Further, some claim that AutoML doesn\u2019t work on unsupervised learning, which is untrue as well.", "Finally, some claim that AutoML can\u2019t do feature engineering, which is disproven by our earlier example of Salesforce\u2019s AutoML, which makes billions of predictions after automated feature engineering.", "The biggest shortcoming of AutoML is that it has no business intuition. AutoML will get you to a production-ready model more quickly, but it won\u2019t tell you why to use ML or what the business justification is, let alone select a justifiable problem to try to solve out of the host of opportunities available.", "Now, let\u2019s say you use gut feeling (rather than a data scientist) to select a problem, and somehow align all stakeholders (even without a data scientist involved) \u2014 you still need to find the right training data.", "AutoML does not have the ability to select the data in the first place \u2014 you need to figure out what data you have that\u2019s indicative of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve.", "Assume we select a problem, align stakeholders, and find indicative data. After building our model, we can easily run into the problem of bias.", "Humans are inherently biased, and this bias is reflected in the data we output. If we blindly train models on biased data, then our models will likely be biased. This was clearly seen with Amazon\u2019s sexist recruiting algorithm or Google\u2019s racist image classification algorithm.", "Further, once our model has been made, it still has to be integrated into the rest of the platform by software engineers. However, software engineers typically don\u2019t understand the limitations of AI, because it\u2019s not their job to do so. You may end up implementing a faulty model.", "Finally, suppose you\u2019ve brought your model to production. A data scientist is the most likely individual to see the value-add of the model, as they\u2019re the ones who champion the implementation of AI. Without any data scientists, you may market the feature incorrectly and not understand in what use-cases it truly shines.", "AutoML is a rapidly-growing field, and for good reason. It enables custom ML models at scale, generating billions of predictions without needing an army of data scientists.", "However, AutoML does not spell the end of data scientists, as it doesn\u2019t \u201cAutoSelect\u201d a business problem to solve, it doesn\u2019t AutoSelect indicative data, it doesn\u2019t AutoAlign stakeholders, it doesn\u2019t provide AutoEthics in the face of potential bias, it doesn\u2019t provide AutoIntegration with the rest of your product, and it doesn\u2019t provide AutoMarketing after the fact.", "These are all areas where having a data scientist on-board can help.", "Ultimately, AutoML is one piece of the puzzle to meaningfully implementing AI in your organization.", "Your home for data science.
