The webpage then generates ad revenue on the user\u2019s clicks or monetizes the user\u2019s activity data. The article itself is not written with journalistic integrity, research or really striving for any deeper meaning \u2014 it is simply a vehicle to monetize user clicks and data.", "With the explosion of social media, smartphones and the state of an increasingly digital world , there is no shortage of content vying for our attention. The ease of sharing and reposting on social media has allowed clutter like clickbait to run absolutely wild.", "As clickbait has become increasingly prevalent across the web (remember when you could scroll through your Twitter feed and only see genuine content?) \u2014 I wanted to see if a headline could be classified using machine learning and what that process looks like. My goal with this project is to provide evidence for implementation on a larger scale on social media or various publisher websites as a \u2018clickbait blocker\u2019 (think \u2018ad blocker\u2019), where clickbait could be flagged or filtered out as such before a viewer ever lays eyes on it!", "For this project, my data consisted of 52,000 headlines from a variety of clickbait and non-clickbait sources from roughly 2007\u20132020. My final dataset was compiled from a dataset found on Kaggle, as well as my own scraping and API calls of Twitter and various online publications. The data was labeled as clickbait or non-clickbait depending on the source and my final dataset was generally balanced (see distribution below).", "Non-clickbait sources: NY Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Bloomberg, The Hindu, WikiNews, Reuters", "As I was initially just working with the text data of each headline, the cleaning and feature engineering steps taken are described below.", "I created the following features to assess along with the headline text data:", "Prior to running any models, I analyzed the word frequencies of clickbait headlines and non-clickbait headlines. There were some clear distinctions in vocabulary as well as some overlap as visualized in the WordClouds below. In the clickbait cloud, numbers were prevalent along with vague terms. For example, a clickbait headline utilizing these words might be something along the lines of \u201cThe 19 best things people actually need\u201d and so a reader would want to click in to read about the specific people or things\u2026", "I also analyzed the class distribution of my engineered features and their relevance on each class. As shown below, on average, clickbait headlines are slightly longer than non-clickbait headlines.", "Clickbait headlines also more often start with a number or pose a question within the headline.", "I trained and tested the following models \u2014 a baseline dummy classifier that predicts the majority class, a Naive Bayes classifier, a Random Forest classifier, a Linear SVM classifier and a Logistic Regression model. The evaluation metrics that I utilized for measuring performance were accuracy and recall. I placed a slight emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives, such as classifying a clickbait article as not clickbait. The following is a snapshot into the accuracy and recall scores of my test predictions:", "Naive Bayes performed the best as shown above in terms of recall and accuracy scores, but the other models were not too far off. Naive Bayes also makes a good final model as it runs a lot faster than the other models, which will work well with a lot more data in a real-world scenario.", "I was able to take a closer look at the model\u2019s process by evaluating the coefficients and I gained useful insight into what features, and words, were being used by the model to make the classification.", "I was able to use machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and SVM to accurately classify clickbait versus non-clickbait headlines. The results were quite good \u2014 within the 90\u201393% range for accuracy scores and 90\u201393% range for recall scores. I slightly prioritized recall as I figured that it would be more valuable to minimize false negatives (classifying clickbait as non-clickbait).", "As machine learning was able to work so well, there is definitely a real-world use case for deploying a machine learning solution to filter out or flag clickbait before a reader even has to visualize and evaluate the headline for themselves!", "By analyzing the coefficients of the models that performed the best, I was able to interpret and get some insight into how the models determined if a headline is clickbait or not.", "I put together a simple web app using Streamlit to demo and test out my model with new headlines.", "Feel free to try the deployed version on Heroku and submit a headline of your choosing for classification: clickbait detector.", "If you\u2019re interested in the code behind this project \u2014 check out my Github: https://github.com/AlisonSalerno/clickbait_detector", "Your home for data science.
