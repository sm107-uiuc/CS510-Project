Our process for evaluating startups is more or less similar to what VCs call due diligence.", "This need of evaluating ML startups comes from the fact that we both need to digitalize our processes to maintain our position in the industry but also the multiplication of startups whose tagline is often a mix of the words AI, algorithms, deep learning, platform, deployment, etc...", "After several successful collaborations, I started to better notice the early signs of a failing ML startup and understand the issues of Machine Learning. In this article, I will present some of the most frequent problems I have encountered.", "Despite the hype, relying on Machine learning is not always the best solution for business issues. In many cases, we have been disappointed by startups \u2026", "Before getting into details, I would like to better define what I mean by failing. My definition concerns startups that will either not deliver what was expected due to the nature of Machine Learning or not grow into a viable and self-sustainable business and will never truly find a good business model. However, they may still get acquired by a larger company, but they won\u2019t survive as standalone companies.", "From a technological point of view, I see a growing number of startups working on exciting business applications using \u201cnew\u201d AI approaches such as Zero-shot learning, GANs, or Federated Learning but when it comes to making businesses more profitable, they struggle just as much as a non-tech startup.", "Machine Learning vs \u2026The first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that a significant number of AI startups tend to underestimate both non-AI and AI competition. In reality, for an important number of business issues, the competition is fierce and the industry already quite overwhelmed when it comes to AI applied on specific business issues (eg. Machine Learning to predict customer churn).", "To be honest, Machine Learning in itself doesn\u2019t give you much advantage as the main goal is to sell it to the users and perfectly fill their needs. Most companies will need a custom-made solution and cannot dedicate extra resources both financial and time-related to the management of a so-called \u201ceasy-to-handle AI solution\u201d.", "Pilot projects issueThe other issue that I noticed is that most AI teams start with pilot customers which are already quite a challenge. I can assure you that it is extremely difficult to convince a large firm to believe in a random startup.", "Before accepting to build a PoC with an ML startup, we ask the following questions:", "The investment is usually high (usually between\u00ad 20k to 150k USD + Maintenance costs) for obvious reasons since the solution will probably be custom-made. For startups, it is a great way to finance the development of the product over the long-term and have access to more data which is crucial.", "A white paper released by Pactera Technologies states that 85% of AI projects fail. Oops.", "However, these pilot projects often solve very specific problems that are difficult to transfer to other companies and use cases. Unfortunately, most large firms will require a high level of customization which can be difficult to achieve for startups. This difficulty in adapting pilot projects to other customers can become a real issue. Indeed, there aren\u2019t many startups that can survive without regularly \u201cshipping\u201d.", "ML-based solutions usually require to be retrained regularly to adapt to the dynamic nature of data, and algorithms written and tweaked for specific customer or application workloads.", "When it comes to the project itself, it is often difficult for startups to go beyond the PoC stage\u2026 Numerous reasons can explain the failure of AI projects but I\u2019ll focus on accuracy expectations, production, management costs, edge cases management, and decision-management.", "I am usually skeptical about the following startups:", "On top of these elements, failing AI startups often underestimate the importance of the word: SCALABILITY. I agree with Mike Lynch, Founder of Invoke Capital, when he says that the reality of the current AI hype is that many of the companies who succeed in securing funding show a woeful lack of understanding of the difficult nature of their problem and of how to test their AI for robustness in the real world.", "Too many times, I have seen promising AI startups managing to have an interesting pilot project with a large firm but later fail to create a solid business model, a performing sales team or understand the difficulty to sell to large firms/scale.", "The long purchasing cycles of large firms can put in risk the life of an AI startup. I have met many CEOs that couldn\u2019t afford to wait for large firms to figure out if they needed an AI solution. Below, I created a list of the most common threats for AI startups.", "As a result, most AI startups I dealt with, struggle in finding the right balance between doing projects for early customers, and investing in a scalable product (large revenue). I share Stefan Seltz-Axmacher\u2019s opinion, CEO of Starsky Robotics when he says that \u201cmany AI teams end up as engineering consultants. They make good revenue with clients, but do not really sell a product at the end.\u201d", "Beyond my opinion as a prospect for AI startups, I know too well that VCs do not positively value this situation. Their goal is to see scalable products with limited implementation costs.", "In reality, cloud operations can be more complex and costly than traditional approaches, particularly because there aren\u2019t good tools to scale AI models globally.", "Once again, I agree with Mike Lynch when he says \u201cAlthough AI techniques are useful in solving certain problems, they are not yet applicable in every case. Adding an off-the-shelf algorithm to old software is not necessarily going to teach it new tricks.\u201d", "Financial Margin vs SaaSAnother interesting aspect is the relatively low average margin of AI startups. Indeed, it is often in the 50\u201360 percent range \u2014 well below the 60\u201380 per cent benchmark for comparable SaaS businesses.", "Perhaps this \u201clow\u201d margin can be explained by the high costs of cloud compute time for ML and the human resources required to clean up the data needed to train and maintain the accuracy of AI systems.", "Even though, the human aspect required to clean the training data can be outsourced to third parties, these services can represent a significant investment, even when outsourced to countries with low incomes and become a privacy challenge.", "I also realized that data preparation steps are often underestimated in AI projects. The simple tasks related to collecting and cleaning data can end up becoming long and frustrating processes. This can be explained by miscommunication and bad expectation setting.", "Deployments tend to also be underestimated\u2026", "The greatest issues we have with ML are related to edge cases, human interventions, and interpretability. At the beginning of a project, we might believe that edge cases or the need to explain results will never become a significant issue and yet\u2026", "Edge cases: Each AI applications inevitably encounter scenarios in which the solution do not perform as expected.", "The more accurate your model becomes, the harder it is to find data sets of specific edge cases that were actually key for the project overall performance. Additionally, the better your model, the more accurate the data you need to improve it.", "This entire constant need for data is often underestimated by both sides.", "An easy mistake would be to expect exponential improvements regarding the ML performance. In most of the computer vision projects that I managed, the cost to improve our accuracy with time always increased, following an S-Curve. AI startups that tend to promise you 100% accuracy after only a couple of weeks, thanks to supervised Machine Learning, often end up underperforming.", "The need for data can also be an issue. Indeed, a large neural network generally needs more training data than a linear model. Usually, when the amount of features in your models is high, the amount of data needed tend to grow exponentially.", "Another key aspect outlined by Stefan Seltz-Axmacher is the necessity of human supervision bound to go down as your models progress. However, depending on the field you chose, it can take years. From an AI startup perspective, the lower your error rates are, the harder it is to improve which again, depending on the field, can become an issue.", "The other important issue is related to the often required human presence in AI processes. Despite having accurately labeled training data (which is rare) and very good models, the \u201chuman in the loop\u201d necessity doesn\u2019t ever completely disappear.", "From a cost perspective, the need to have someone to keep your solution producing accurate results can make you reconsider the relevance of an AI implementation compared to other less costly solutions relying more on better interfaces.", "In many industries or use cases, the ability to understand the logic behind results is key. If your clients rely heavily on traditional statistical methods, it is unlikely they will accept a solution in which the model isn\u2019t interpretable. The ability to explain how your algorithms work is also a testimony of your expertise.", "In reality, a Product Manager is more likely to accept the ML recommendations if the results can be explained.", "Often, we met with AI startups having issues explaining the results available in our PoCs. Needless to say that because of this, we did not feel confident moving forward in production.", "I believe that either you are building your model to explain or predict something. Most of the time, a model that is better at explaining a phenomenon is not great at predicting it.", "Moreover, models that accurately predict results often have features that are really obvious and make up a large part of the predictive power, so that doesn\u2019t give them great explanatory powers.", "On top of the above-mentioned issues related to ML, I could have also explained the problems related to the poor transfer learning ability of ML-based.", "Beyond Machine Learning, the fundamental issue of why AI startups fail is mostly related to business basics. AI startups need to control the mechanics of going to market, creating a product\u2019s value proposition, finding out their true competitive moat/defensibility, scalability, customer traction, etc.", "Technical differentiation is hard to achieve in the AI industry. Indeed, new model architectures are being developed mostly in open, academic settings. Moreover, pre-trained models are available from open-source libraries, and model parameters can be optimized automatically.", "Finally, data is the most important aspect of an AI product and yet, it is often owned by other companies, available in the public domain (open data), or end up becoming a commodity.", "Succeeding as an AI startup is extremely difficult. Especially, for use cases where Machine Learning needs to perform at 100% accuracy...", "AI Consultant \u2014 Working on Brain-computer interface and new AI business models \u2014 Support my writing:
