It may not be so apparent, but under the right scope, it can help us uncover hidden patterns in data. Traditionally speaking though, we rely on analytical solutions to do Hypothesis Testing. Think of the t-test to compare the means of two distributions\u00b9 or the Pearson correlation to measure a linear dependency between two variables\u00b2. The significance of these statistics always rely on a p value\u00b3. A correlation of 0.30 means nothing if we do not know its p value as the correlation score could be explained by chance. Like this, the interpretation of any statistic is bound to it and the smaller it is, the lower the probability that the patterns we are seeing can be explained by chance.", "The drawbacks of these parametric tests is that they depend on assumptions (as normality in the data for example\u2074) and serve only one purpose. A two-sampled t-test can help you decide if the mean of two normal distributions are significantly different from each other. What about the median, mode, kurtosis, skewness, etc. of two distributions? Can they be considered statistically different? This question cannot be answered with this test. For this, we can use randomness in our own advantage.", "Here, I will show a very simple way in which you can test the significance of virtually any statistic you want with the use of random permutation testing\u2075. I am assuming you already know simple coding in Python and understand basic Algebra and Statistics. By the end of the tutorial I hope you know how you can apply this powerful technique to assess statistical significance in your own data. Let\u2019s get to it!", "A permutation test is basically doing what this image is doing, but to our data. We shuffle and mix everything together to get a big pool of data and compare this pool with what we had before shuffling it. It is not exactly that, but you can get an idea of what we will do here.", "Generally speaking, there are two kinds of permutation tests that we will use. The first one is to assess the probability that the difference of a statistic between two distributions is explained by chance. Think of a t-test, but for any sort of metric you want, not only the mean. The second is to measure the probability that a dependency between two variables (correlation, mutual information\u2075, etc) is explained by chance. The lower this probability, the higher the significance of your test.", "I will stick with the Iris Flower Dataset, which can be found within sklearn and with which we can easily explore statistical significance between the features. Let\u2019s import all modules and load the dataset before building our permutation algorithms:", "A step-by-step guide to build this algorithm looks like this:", "1.Choose your metric which we will call it \u03c4. This can be any distribution metric like mean, median, kurtosis, etc. I am choosing the average (mean) and will do the permutation test on first feature only (sepal length) between Iris virginica and Iris versicolor, you can change this for whatever metric/feature you want.", "2. Compute the ground truth absolute difference \u0394\u03c4 between \u03c4\u2081 and \u03c4\u2082 from your two variables:", "Or in code for our example:", "3. Pool your variables into one single distribution:", "4. Randomly sample (also called bootstrapping) without replacement two distributions with the size equal to the original distributions from this pooled distribution to compute the absolute difference R\u0394\u03c4 of your metric between your two permuted samples:", "and repeat this p times (we will do it 1000 times here):", "5. Finally, the proportion of permuted differences higher than your ground truth difference is your significance value:", "That\u2019s it! This is how it looks:", "BOOM! This basically means that the our ground truth difference (gT) is much higher than 1000 differences created by random resampling. No permuted differences were higher, so we can say that the difference between the means of these two variables is hardly explained by chance. What about the p-value of a parametric t-test between the same features of these two species?", "Highly significant also. See where I\u2019m heading? Going further, comparing the second feature (sepal width) with a t-test throws a p-value of 0.0018. Still significant, but not as low as the other. What about our permutation test?", "Fantastic! Even more surprising is the fact that our permuted p-value is 0.001 (very little is explained by chance), exactly the same as in our traditional t-test!", "Both methods can be used to asses for significant differences of the means, but permutations can be used for any other metric, remember that. Now let\u2019s build the algorithm for statistical dependencies and using the Pearson Correlation as our \u03c4.", "For this example I will choose to measure the significance of the linear Correlation between sepal length and sepal width in Iris setosa. A scatter between these variables looks like this:", "Good news is that steps are almost the same. The only difference is that instead of computing the absolute difference, we simply compute a dependency \u03c4 like a Pearson Correlation for the ground truth as well as in every permutation step while shuffling one of the variables only and keeping the other intact\u2077. In code this looks like this:", "printing p_val throws a 0, which again means highly significant! Finally, these permuted correlations look like this:", "With this tutorial you should be able to apply this technique to your own data. Remember, you can use any statistical metric/dependency you want. Maybe you want to measure if the kurtosis of two variables are different? No problem. Significance of Mutual Information\u2076 between two variables? No big deal. This method gets you covered in all these type of cases.", "Happy coding and thanks for reading!", "[4] Ghasemi, A., & Zahediasl, S.
