Most of our analytics fix was generously provided for by CNN (oop, just called ourselves out with that one). But we\u2019re not your ordinary group of sheep-le over here. No no, we\u2019re some of the more savvy consumers of click-bait information. We use the Google too!! And what we (and many others probably) noticed early on, was that there was a discrepancy between Google\u2019s little macro (powered by AP) and CNN\u2019s classic US map dashboard (although it definitely is getting fancier). The numbers being reported were the same but a difference in information delivery paradigm caused an interesting bit of confusion in our household. Allow me to explain\u2026", "If a state had more Republicans votes at the time, CNN would shade it red (or blue for the opposing case) which gave the impression that the candidate had won or at least was \u201cwinning\u201d the state. Fine, makes sense. However, Google took it one step further. They provided two \u201cgrades\u201d of shading! A light color meant the candidate was leading the popular vote of that state whereas a darker won meant that the candidate had \u201cwon\u201d the state. Tip of the hat for the addition of this clever, intuitive visualization feature.", "So what\u2019s the problem? Shouldn\u2019t the candidate that is winning the state\u2019s popular vote be the one whom the analytics-gods inevitably deem as the \u201cwinner\u201d of that state? Not necessarily. Take Virginia for example. Sometime around 8:30pm EST Biden was losing by ~20%. As the CNN anchors were stewing about how Biden needed to make some sort of heroic effort to save this \u201cblue\u201d state from flipping (as if that\u2019s how election night worked), Google\u2019s map filled in dark blue signifying that not only was Biden winning Virginia\u2026 he\u2019d won!! Well now as you can imagine this caused a bit of confusion around here and I decided to investigate.", "At around 8:30pm EST, state officials had counted 33% of votes and Biden was losing by 20%. However, the Google macro had shaded this state dark blue to signify an unquestionable Biden victory. Ok, what the heck? My mom felt that way and it wasn\u2019t helped by the television pundits who kept the game-show illusion going with the rhetoric that \u201chopefully Biden pulls back in Virginia.\u201d The statisticians knew something that we as viewers were not being told.", "Mathematical modeling is all about simplifying the real world. In another post, we showed how quickly you can call an election if you simplify the model into hypergeometric equivalent (a bag of marbles). We pretended that instead of going to various polling offices, mail boxes, etc, the people cast their votes by bringing a marble of a specific color (red or blue) to one big-ol marble bag located in the state\u2019s capital on election day. We showed that if the bag was well mixed, we would only need to draw a few thousand to make a really good guess as to what the composition of the bag was.", "However, you can see how this is unrealistic because, in real life, there is more than one bag of marbles. In fact, there are 133 counties and over 2500 precincts in Virginia. If we were to use the one bag model, we\u2019d make the egregious error of assuming that we could draw from any of these bags and make a general statement about the entire state.", "Well why not? That\u2019s how the information is displayed to us through the media? 33% of votes have been counted people! That\u2019s well over our 10,000 marble threshold that we mathematically posited would be sufficient. Trump won Virginia folks\u2026close the books!", "So in lies the real work of a professional statistician: choosing representative samples is hard.", "But let\u2019s say that we needed to say SOMETHING even though we knew that our sample was biased. Well, what if instead of assuming a single bag of votes, we assumed that each county was a smaller bag within that bag. Yes, the state\u2019s marble bag is actually a bag of county marble bags (the rabbit hole continues!).", "But does this explain what happened Tuesday? Well, let\u2019s look at the data. I took some numbers directly off the Virginia state\u2019s official election reporting website sometime on 11/5 (votes should be in at that time). The final count at that time said that Biden had been awarded 53% of the counted votes. Recalling Tuesday night, CNN would\u2019ve had us believing that this was some sort of heroic push but I think the statisticians would argue that it was inevitable. Let\u2019s see.", "Ok, let\u2019s start by doing a quick thought experiment to see if we can recreate the situation we saw at 8:30pm on Tues when Biden was losing by 20% but was declared the winner. Let\u2019s pretend that 10,000 votes are counted from each county (i.e. ~1.5 million of Virginia\u2019s ~4.5 million total votes). The following is a plot of 30 randomly selected counties in Virginia and how they might\u2019ve looked after counting their first 10,000 votes. (I\u2019ve put a box around Fairfax County because it becomes important later \u2014 stay tuned.)", "If I add up the votes from all the counties, we can see that Trump would have a commanding lead over Biden at this early stage (shown on the left below). However, the statisticians look at the early estimate of the individual counties above and realize that Trump has already lost. How?", "What they might\u2019ve done is they take the votes that they\u2019ve already counted and guess the proportion of Biden votes contained within the uncounted, future votes. In fact, if we think we know how many people will vote we can use Bayesian inference to infer a range of potential votes for each county (by inferring a range on p like we did with Illinois). Then just repeat the process for each county and add up the totals for the low and high estimate cases (right figure). And with that, you can see that even the unimaginably worst case scenario for Biden (labeled \u201clow\u201d below), he still is well above the red \u201cline to win\u201d drawn at 50% of the votes.", "Ok, for those of you who followed all the way up until now you might still be asking: how could this be? Well, let\u2019s just look at the raw results from the 30 most populous counties and I feel like the answer should be obvious. Check out how many votes Biden picked up in Fairfax County. In fact, he won the top 12 most populous counties in Virginia (in some cases by a landslide).", "Of course, votes aren\u2019t actually counted at the same speed and my little model I presented here isn\u2019t actually the numbers from Tuesday night (8:30pm). But\u2026 it shows that while the public is being fed one story about Trump leading by 20%, the statisticians have already realized he doesn\u2019t have a prayer of winning Virginia.", "Well, this is all very interesting, but what about swing states? And, this is not doing a whole lot to convince me whether or not my vote counts. I\u2019d argue that it does but this post is getting a bit long. I try to answer those questions in greater detail in other posts.", "Thanks for reading! Would appreciate any feedback!", "Consider giving a clap (or 10?) so TDS will share it more readily with others", "Check out my other case studies on the election:", "Your home for data science.
