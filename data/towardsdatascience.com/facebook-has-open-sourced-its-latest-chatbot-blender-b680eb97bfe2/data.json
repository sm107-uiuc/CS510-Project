Now, according to Facebook\u2019s own pairwise human evaluations,", "The main difference between the other chatbots and Blender is that Blender has the ability to assume a persona, show empathy, and discuss nearly any topic.", "At the time of writing this article, Google has not yet commented on this claim.", "According to FAIR, the recipes for Blender\u2019s impressive results are:", "Common to other natural language processing projects, Blender was trained at a huge scale, which involved 1.5 billion public Reddit conversations.", "In addition, the model was fine-tuned using Blended Skill Talk (BST), which strengthened the model for the following skills:", "During the training and fine-tune process, a number of possible generation strategies including beam search, next token sampling, n-gram blocking, and a careful choice of search hyperparameters were used.", "Although the results seem excellent, Blender\u2019s skills are still far from achieving human-level intelligence in dialogue systems.", "So far, the team has only evaluated chatbots with 14-turn conversation flows. Researchers said that Blender likely would be repetitive and dull over the course of several days or weeks of conversation.", "Another problem is that Blender can\u2019t remember earlier conversations. Blender uses the standard Transformer architectures which have a hard limit of 128 BPE tokens of history, so cannot possibly expand upon things they have learned from or about the user, refer to previous things they said.", "Blender also tends to collate facts, which is a limitation in deep learning due to the fact it generates sentences based on statistical correlation rather than knowledge.", "Do you still remember Tay?

These chatbots are trained to mimic human to human conversations, they can sometimes learn undesirable features from human-human data.", "FAIR has been trying to solve this problem by asking crowdworkers to filter out toxic language. However, this seems almost an impossible task as the Reddit dataset is too large. In addition, the team also tried to apply a classifier to detect toxic language before it is shown, but they note that such classifiers are still not infallible.", "That\u2019s about it.
