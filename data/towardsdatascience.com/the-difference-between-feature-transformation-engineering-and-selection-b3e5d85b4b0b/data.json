First, we have Feature Transformation, which modifies the data, to make it more understandable for the machine. It is a combination of Data Cleaning and Data Wrangling.", "Here, we fill in the empty values, encode the categorical resources, resize the numeric columns, and apply standardization and normalization; Note that we don\u2019t create new columns from the current ones; This is where Transformation differs from Feature Engineering.", "Feature Engineering uses already modified features to create new ones, which will make it easier for any Machine Learning algorithm to understand and learn any pattern.", "For example, we can create two new columns that will check whether patients have hyponatremia (sodium concentration less than 135) or hypernatremia (sodium concentration greater than 145).

That way, you can create training, validation, and testing sets with the right resources.", "But wait!
