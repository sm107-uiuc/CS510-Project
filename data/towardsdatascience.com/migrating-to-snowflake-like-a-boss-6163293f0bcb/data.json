Isolating storage from compute will save your company so much money, and on top of that, your VP can generate fancy new dashboards for your CEO to track.", "Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing platform, makes it easy for data teams to store and use data. Unlike traditional storage solutions, Snowflake supports a plethora of data types and business intelligence tools and makes it easy for internal and external teams to collaborate throughout the ETL pipeline. A relational database, Snowflake can also support most structured and unstructured data types.", "Like your VP, many of my customers are excited at the prospect of migrating to a cloud storage and compute solution like Snowflake but they don\u2019t know where to start. Rightly so: I was able to find several articles about migrating from Redshift to Snowflake, but very little about making the polar plunge from other solutions.", "After talking to several migrators in the field, I broke down some lesser-discussed considerations for teams moving to Snowflake, regardless of where you\u2019re starting from:", "Unlike other data warehouses, Snowflake does not support partitions or indexes. Instead, Snowflake automatically divides large tables into micro-partitions, which are used to calculate statistics about the value ranges each column contains. These insights then determine which parts of your data set you actually need to run your query.", "For most practitioners, this paradigm shift from indexes to micro-partitions really shouldn\u2019t be an issue (in fact, many people choose to migrate to Snowflake because this approach reduces query latency). Still, if you have partitions and indexes in your current ecosystem and are migrating to \u201cclustering\u201d models, you need a sound approach. A few tips for a safe migration:", "Bidding adieu to partitions and indexes is nothing to lose sleep over as long as you have visibility into your data.", "Several data teams I spoke with repeatedly called out syntax issues as an inevitable component of any cloud warehouse migration, and a migration to Snowflake is no exception.", "One data analyst specifically called out the difficulty converting SSIS packages for handling ETL from her SQL Server to Snowflake, which admits that SSIS packages are not easily integrated with their solution. Such errors were not only frustrating, but substantially slowed down her migration, leading to unforeseen costs and resource constraints.", "While modeling solutions like DBT help with validating data sets, the formatting of functions like hashing, time stamps, and dates are often inconsistent between old and new versions of the data.", "Additionally, Snowflake is case sensitive, so it\u2019s important that you check for comparison issues in queries. As a result of these issues, some companies can expect to inspect and refactor ALL lines of SQL being migrated.", "Syntax errors become a bigger pain point for companies in traditional industries, such as financial services or healthcare (ICD10 codes, I\u2019m looking at you) that have long relied on legacy solutions and manual, error-prone data input. Simply moving to the cloud won\u2019t fix these issues. As one data analyst at a public sector consulting firm told me: \u201cEven if you hire amazing people and put the best data dictionary in front of them, they probably can\u2019t tell you what it all means.\u201d", "The sooner you accept syntax errors as a part of the process, the easier it is to identify trends and patterns in these inconsistencies that can expedite their resolution.", "Similar to syntax errors, data issues can cause even the smoothest Snowflake migrations to fail, generating false or misleading analysis once you hook up your business intelligence tools. Oftentimes these will result in silent errors that will go unnoticed until a consumer downstream catches an issue in a report or dashboard. If you\u2019re lucky, it\u2019s an internal user \u2014 and if you\u2019re not, it might just be that new important customer you onboarded only last week and are trying to impress.", "Another analyst we spoke with at a digital marketing consultancy noted that it can be hard to ensure comprehensive data definition between your old and new data warehouses. After a few data errors popped up in her company\u2019s new Snowflake warehouse, she decided to test the reliability of their data by evolving two parallel data analytics layers, one her legacy warehouse and one via Snowflake. Using Looker to generate metrics for both stacks, they quickly determined that there were, in fact, inconsistencies between the two warehouses, with each set of metrics presenting different data volumes.", "When upgrading your data warehouse, make sure you\u2019re also upgrading the way your team operates, from small things like syntax concurrency all the way to data quality and reliability.", "You\u2019ve invested so much in this migration (rightfully so!), it\u2019d be silly to let it all go to waste if the data itself can\u2019t be trusted.", "If you move on from indexes and partitions, expect syntax issues, and prioritize data quality, you\u2019ll achieve a more seamless Snowflake migration, facilitating easier collaboration and delivering true business value for your organization.", "Moving to Snowflake means more flexibility and scalability for your team, as well as quicker, more reliable insights for your customers \u2014 and if you do it right, it can be a force multiplier for your entire organization, too.", "Don\u2019t worry: you\u2019ll also impress your boss. I guarantee it.", "If you want to learn more, reach out to Barr Moses.", "This article was co-written by Barr Moses, CEO of Monte Carlo, & Lior Gavish, CTO of Monte Carlo.", "Your home for data science.
