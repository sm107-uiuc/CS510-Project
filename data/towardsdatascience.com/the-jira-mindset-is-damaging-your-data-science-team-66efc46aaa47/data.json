Built originally to manage software development projects, it naturally gets re-applied to data science projects. I want to argue that, though Jira may be a fine tool, data science projects are different!", "Managing data science projects causes plenty of lively discussion (if you\u2019re an optimist) or plenty of arguments (if you\u2019re a pessimist) [1]. On the one hand there\u2019s the default position that because data scientists are often based in a technology department, they should be managed like a specialised sort of software developer. On the other hand there\u2019s a view that because data scientists often have research backgrounds they should be treated like researchers and given free reign \u201cto be creative\u201d.", "Neither works. However the risks of the latter approach are a bit more obvious to management types: you give these data scientists free reign, and they drift off into irrelevance, doing nothing for the bottom line. So I want to spend this week\u2019s post on what\u2019s wrong with the former position. Just why are data scientists so resistant to the processes that software developers and managers take for granted?", "Now firstly, I should say that I\u2019m a committed believer in some sort of project management. Just as an orchestra needs a conductor [2], a team needs someone in a coordinating function. One problem is there isn\u2019t broad agreement on what to call them. At Microsoft they\u2019re all called Program Managers. Other places would call them Project Managers. I\u2019ve seen people with the job title Product Manager perform the role. Or even Business Analyst.", "Faced with all this confusion, some places (and I\u2019m naming no names here) just hire one of each and hope they\u2019ll sort out who does what for themselves. This can lead to Jesuitical arguments about the differences between the roles. Also, depending on whether you are a thinker or a feeler [3], I\u2019ve seen the hilarious/tragic sight of teams with a product manager, program manager, business analyst, and project manager all managing two poor data scientists. Now can we blame those two data scientists for being resistant to the processes created by the four managers? After all, who\u2019s actually doing the real work [4]?", "So maybe data scientists dissatisfied with process is a sign of broken processes, not of broken data scientists.", "Now for our purposes I\u2019m just going to lump everyone in that coordinating role under the job title \u201cPM\u201d. If you\u2019re a data scientist and unsure who I mean by your PM, they\u2019re the orchestra conductor of your team \u2014 i.e. they\u2019re at the front, waving their arms, making weird faces.", "Anyway, in any project, a PM has to show progress. And this data science stuff is complicated. So maybe we just assign people tasks, and then pull together burndown charts showing how many tasks have been completed. We could even produce charts showing who\u2019s done what! Senior management eat that stuff up. And here\u2019s this awesome tool that makes all this kind of thing really, really easy, so let\u2019s just go with that \u2026", "Now, Jira does this sort of thing very well, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However there is a mindset out in the world that says \u201cwe\u2019re ticking tasks off, therefore we\u2019re delivering\u201d. And this is wrong. Really, really wrong. And Jira encourages that mindset, because, well, it organises the world into tasks to be ticked off.", "Let\u2019s examine that difference between ticking tasks off and delivering something useful. It might seem counter intuitive at first. Surely, one of the basic principles of project management is that you take a big thing, break it into a lot of predictable little things, then work your way through those little things. In other words you split your big thing into tasks and tick off those tasks one by one. There\u2019s even a very well understood, government approved system for doing this, called Prince2 (calm down Agile people, we\u2019ll get to you in a bit). Large numbers of people rejoice in having various fancy sounding qualifications in this Prince2 system. Hell, if I were building a skyscraper, I\u2019d use this system. It worked for the London Olympics, right?", "So the question becomes: is a data science project like a skyscraper project?", "The first difference is the end goal. The goal of the skyscraper project is to build an artefact. The business goal of using that artefact, i.e. to let out offices/hotels/flats/whatever is abstracted away by dizzying layers of financial jiggery-pokery that go all the way up to the funds that are looking after your pension. Just don\u2019t think about the slice of your money that each layer is pocketing.", "The point is, as a humble engineer, you can just get on and build the damn skyscraper and not worry too much about the business side of things.", "As a humble data scientist, you don\u2019t have this luxury. Your job is not to build an artefact, it is to change an ongoing business process for the better. Let me give an example that is, ahem, concrete: your job isn\u2019t to build a model that predicts subscription churn, your job is to actually reduce subscription churn. A predictive model might help, or it might not. It\u2019s no good shrugging your shoulders and saying \u201cI just built a model because you told me to\u201d.", "OK, so you\u2019re going to improve this business process. Where do you start \u2014 what\u2019s actually going to move the number? Well you probably can think of a tonne of things. Reminder emails? Personalised recommendations? Product discounts?", "And at this point, as a data scientist, you notice two things. Firstly, data science forms a very small part of what you\u2019re trying to do, so you better be working with some other people. Secondly, you have no idea what will and won\u2019t work.", "Here we come to the second difference between a data science project and the skyscraper. Your skyscraper is being built in a mostly predictable environment, with mostly predictable materials to a more-or-less fixed design. In that world it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to break these mostly predictable outcomes into mostly predictable subtasks and work your way through them.", "In many data science projects, none of this applies. The environment is always changing because senior managers seem to keep changing their mind. A data scientist\u2019s equivalent of materials are the techniques that they work with, and it\u2019s basically impossible to predict what will work and what won\u2019t up front. You don\u2019t know which product related feature will make a difference. Reminder email? Recommended article? Discount? So coming up with a fixed design is impossible \u2014 who knows how customers will react?", "The best you can do is experiment, as rapidly as possible. And then use the results of your experiment to decide what to experiment on next, and then gather the next set of results and so on. In other words you need to iterate.", "There you go. Clich\u00e9s are clich\u00e9s for a reason.", "Now everyone pays lip service to iteration, thanks to the MVP movement. However rarely have I seen the implications fully incorporated into the working of an organisation. If you\u2019re doing this right, once you\u2019ve completed your first task, you\u2019re going to have to change the following tasks based on whatever you found out.", "In other words, your plans are useless.", "Now it may give you a warm glow inside to lay out a list of things that you\u2019re going to do. However you shouldn\u2019t delude yourself into thinking that the list of things to do will bear any relation to what you\u2019ll actually end up doing. And if the items on the isn\u2019t going to relate to what you end up doing, then remind me of the point again?", "This then is the problem with the Jira mindset. If you\u2019re using the tool as intended you are going to spend your life removing tickets, changing tickets, deprioritizing tickets \u2014 simply because your tasks are always going to be changing based on what you are learning as you go. It\u2019s not Jira itself that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s the idea that you are operating in a predictable world that can be organised into a task list.", "Look the 12 principles of agile software development are Awesome with a capital \u2018A\u2019. It\u2019s one of the documents I find myself referring to over and over again. Also they\u2019re so elegantly expressed that they resist summary. Take a read of them here [5].", "Back? Suitably impressed? Well, less awesome than the agile manifesto itself are Agile processes, with a capital \u2018A\u2019. In fact it\u2019s got to the point that one of the authors of the manifesto has disowned the Agile Process [6]. So from now on I\u2019m going to use the word agile (small a) to refer to processes consistent with the agile manifesto and Agile (big A) to refer to the sorts of processes that companies push on data scientists.", "And what are these processes? Well they can be bafflingly complex, involving a terminology of Stories, Epics, Ceremonies, and Spikes. However in the end, though the intention might be different, I\u2019ve only ever seen Agile being done as collections of tasks to be ticked off. And this for me, is the \u201cJira mindset\u201d, closer to Prince2 than it is to the agile manifesto.", "Well that could be a post in itself! But here\u2019s a brief list for Data Science PM\u2019s to think about:", "Just a final note, I\u2019ve been kind of mean about project managers. They\u2019re easy targets, and this data science stuff is still pretty new. We\u2019ll come back to how data scientists and project managers should work together in the future, but for now suffice to say that project managers come in two types. There are some who don\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on, and are trying to force everything into whatever project management methodology they\u2019ve done a course on. These people are basically net negatives on a project. Organisations can\u2019t sustain net negatives.", "The other kind, common in tech companies but maybe rarer outside them, are basically worth their weight in gold. If you happen to have one in your organisation, you should probably be thinking about how to hang onto them at all costs!", "[1] See for example O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Agile Data Science 2.0", "[2] Every rule has its exception. See the Persimfans orchestra.", "[3] \u201cI have often said, and oftener think, that this world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel \u2014 a solution of why Democritus laughed and Heraclitus wept.\u201d Horace Walpole, Letter to Sir Horace Mann (31 December 1769)", "[4] For a slightly depressing read, see David Graeber on B******t Jobs. (Language warning, in the title only)", "[5] The agile manifesto is viewable in all its early noughties glory.", "[6] See Dave Thomas speak here.", "[7] Or something like that.
