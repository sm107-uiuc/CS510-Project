In a time where environmental issues are becoming increasingly political, the Amazon wildfires have become an incendiary topic that has garnered much attention on the international stage. The intense media coverage and public condemnation from foreign powers and environmental agencies have only helped to add fuel to the fire, so to speak.", "But why did these fires happen? What are the main causes and how much worse is it than in previous years? How does a forest fire even start in a rainforest?", "In this article, we will discuss the environmental and geopolitical background of the Amazon rainforest, followed by an analysis of forest fire data from previous years as well as new information from published research about the 2019 forest fires and their future ramifications.", "Before we discuss the fires, it is necessary to get some context of the environmental and political background of the Amazon and its relation to fires.", "The Amazon Biome spans approximately 6.7 million square kilometers, which is twice the size of India. The basin is shared by eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname), as well as the overseas territory of French Guiana. Approximately 60% of the Amazon Basin is located within Brazil, and thus the political situation in Brazil has a large impact on the region.", "Whilst the Amazon rainforest is far removed from most people, it contains the highest biodiversity of anywhere in the world, and is home to around 30% of the world\u2019s known species, as well as to 390 billion trees (more than 50 times the number of humans on Earth) belonging to over 16,000 different species. By the 2010 IBGE census, 817,000 Brazilians classified themselves as indigenous.", "Due to the plethora of species, the preponderance of trees, and the large numbers of indigenous people living predominantly within remote regions of the Amazon, these groups have the most to lose from land-use changes related to deforestation, urbanization, and forest fires.", "The rivers of the Amazon basin accounts for 15\u201316% of the world\u2019s total river discharge into the oceans. The Amazon River flows for more than 6,600 km, and with its hundreds of tributaries and streams contains the largest number of freshwater fish species in the world.", "Whilst the Amazon is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, accounting for more than 50% of the global tropical rainforest, the oft-repeated claim that the Amazon rainforest produces 20% of our planet\u2019s oxygen is based on a misunderstanding. In fact, nearly all of Earth\u2019s breathable oxygen originated in the oceans, and there is enough of it to last for millions of years. There are many reasons to be appalled by this year\u2019s Amazon fires, but depleting Earth\u2019s oxygen supply is not one of them.", "Forest plants produce lots of oxygen, and forest microbes consume a lot of oxygen. As a result, the net production of oxygen by forests \u2014 and indeed, all land plants \u2014 is very close to zero. It is accurate to say, however, that the Amazon rainforest produces approximately 20% of the world\u2019s oxygen turnover.", "Despite the name \u2018rainforest\u2019, the Amazon rainforest does have a dry season. However, this dry season still has a lot of water, just markedly less than the wet season which sees daily monsoons occur.", "Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) during all months of the year. Average annual rainfall is no less than 168 cm (66 in) and can exceed 1,000 cm (390 in) although it typically lies between 175 cm (69 in) and 200 cm (79 in).", "That being said, most fires within the Amazon tropical rainforest and anthropogenic (human-made) as opposed to biogenic (natural). These can be for many reasons, such as illegal logging, deforestation efforts, agricultural burning, etc.", "As forestry experts explain it, spontaneous fires are rare in the moist rainforest. Rather, workers first cut the trees, leave them to dry and finally set fire to them during the dry season. Usually, only the felled part is dry enough to burn, and fires remain confined to the intended areas. In the absence of transport or roads, the timber cannot be sold, and burning is the easiest way to clear the land.", "These methods are known as slash-and-burn methods and are used to clear the forest to make way for agriculture, livestock, logging, and mining. Whilst this is illegal within the nations containing part of the Amazon rainforest, the enforcement of regulations is lax, and budget cuts to the Brazilian Environmental Agency in recent years have resulted in substantially less manpower and resources to enforce the regions most affected.", "It is particularly easy for these \u201ccontrolled\u201d fires to lose control and propagate into forest regions, which are then notoriously difficult to stop.", "In addition, there are issues even with sawmills that are little appreciated. The sawmill process is illustrated below.", "There are currently no laws in place for disposing of waste products from the sawmill process. They could be used as fuel in a biomass plant or buried in a landfill. However, there are no biomass plants that will purchase wood chips or shavings, and burying waste in a landfill will result in a fine. As a result, many sawmills simply burn their waste products in open air. Direct combustion of wood is particularly damaging to the atmosphere, even more so than coal.", "Whilst most fires in the Amazon are started by humans, this is not always the case. The three main causes of forest fires are:", "The only one of those that we see a lot of in the tropical Amazon is lightning strikes, and a relatively dry environment during El Nino years, which are often correlated with droughts in South America.", "Typically, a high moisture content prevents ignition of fires and slows their propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water present in the material and heat the material to its fire point.", "In dense forests, which are present in most parts of the tropical Amazon rainforest, there is more shade which results in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, making these areas less susceptible to wildfires.", "Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.", "Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.", "Forest fires are also a massive source of carbon and release tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. On top of this, trees that are burning cannot remove CO2 from the atmosphere and thus have compounding implications for climate change.", "Even in the depths of the Amazon, there are many cities, towns, and villages.", "For example, Manaus is an urban metropolis with 2 million inhabitants in the heart of the Amazon tropical rainforest. Manaus is famous for the \u2018meeting of the waters\u2019, the location where there is a confluence of the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes to form the Amazon river.", "During the burning season, the emissions from naturally-burning trees are exacerbated by anthropogenic emissions from industries and domestic emissions from cooking, heating, etc.", "This synergy results in even higher levels of particulate matter, aerosols, and ground-level ozone than would be seen in a normal city. Below shows an image of the air quality on a day during the burning season in Manaus during a research campaign onboard the Gulfsteam-1 aircraft.", "Finding pollution levels that rival that of cities like Beijing in the middle of the rainforest should both surprise and concern you, and is something that environmental scientists study. As you can imagine, urban air quality is further reduced during seasons with an increased number of fires.", "World leaders almost unanimously agree that climate change is a reality. Climate change has been in discussion since Alexander von Humboldt first alluded to it in 1800, and has since been an undisputed fact among scientists since the 1990s.", "At this point, rejecting the reality of climate change would be as nonsensical as denying the reality of evolution or the spherical nature of the Earth.", "There are controversial arguments still happening, but the major disagreements nowadays can be categorized into two main questions:", "The first question is mainly for scientists and is extremely difficult to prove due to the highly dynamic and complex nature of the Earth and its biogeochemical cycling.", "This difficulty also recurs in the second issue. There are a million factors that affect the climate and hundreds of technologies that could be used to help mitigate the effects of climate change.", "Couple this with economic and national interests, as well as the scope of such a global problem, and it is easy to see how nobody knows what to do, and, even if they did, they would have very little economic incentive to act.", "This is one reason the geopolitics of climate change is a bit of a mess, a global-scale tragedy of the commons.", "The politics of the rainforest has been intense for many years, encompassing issues such as the destruction of rubber plantations (environmentally friendly) for the growth of livestock (not environmentally friendly), environmental activism in the 1980s that culminated in the murder of Chico Mendes, and the decimation of indigenous populations.", "In recent years, due to the increasing environmentalism as a result of climate change and other environmental issues, the politics of this issue have become even more heated.", "For more than a century, a series of Brazilian governments have sought to move into the country\u2019s interior, developing the Amazon. From the populist president-turned-dictator who made one of the early industrial pushes into the forest in the 1930s to the military dictatorship that ruled the country for two decades from 1964 until 1985, the justifications have largely been the same: economic gain.", "This original plan was known as Operation Amazon, the plan created during the military government envisioned integrating the territory into Brazil through building roads and developing agricultural and corporate enterprises.", "Jair Bolsonaro, the new president that was sworn in on January 1st, 2019, has a similar plan to develop the country\u2019s interior. Bolsonaro is a supporter of agribusiness and has come out strongly against several agencies and foreign nations aiming to safeguard the Amazon rainforest. He has said he will not tolerate the agenda of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and has come out strongly against lands reserved for indigenous tribes.", "As you can imagine, all of this pro-business rhetoric has negative impacts on the environment. By incentivizing farmers to farm more livestock and soybeans, this essentially incentivized large-scale burning of forest to make way for pastures and agriculture.", "On top of that, Bolsonaro cut funding to the Brazilian Environmental Agency, resulting in a lack of resources to effectively regulate the interior. The agency\u2019s enforcement actions decreased by 20 percent during the first six months of this year, compared with the same period in 2018.", "In one press conference, he said agents from IBAMA, the main federal agency tasked with enforcing environmental laws, were issuing too many fines.", "\u201cThe guy would arrive with a pen in each hand, applying astronomical fines \u2026 We put an end to that.\u201d", "As we are all aware, these events subsequently led to large-scale unregulated burning of forests in August 2019 that caught the attention of the world.", "This event resulted in the public condemnation of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro by multiple environmental agencies and foreign powers, notably by Emmanuel Macron, the French president.", "Bolsonaro suggested nongovernmental organizations were setting the forest ablaze to discredit his government. The Brazilian minister of the environment, Ricardo Salles, tweeted that \u201cdry weather, wind, and heat\u201d were to blame.", "Paulo Artaxo (a prominent atmospheric physicist) stated \u201cthere is no doubt that this rise in fire activity is associated with a sharp rise in deforestation\u201d.", "Bolsonaro initially rejected the attention from the media and foreign powers, claiming that the reports of fires were sensationalist. However, after mounting international pressure at the 45th G7 summit where he was threatened by the loss of an EU-Mercosur free trade agreement, Bolsonaro dispatched over 44,000 troops to the interior to fight fires.", "Despite the fact that this problem was resolved, it is unlikely that this is the last we will hear of this story, with the president set to be in power for several more years.", "Bolsonaro plans to develop nuclear and hydroelectric power in the Amazon Basin, as well as expanding mining operations for Nickel, which could prove to be controversial to some, especially after the environmental issues of previous projects such as the Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu river.", "As an environmental scientist who frequently visits and studies the Amazon rainforest, I have seen first-hand the results of these fires.", "As we discussed, it is not uncommon to experience some burning, especially during the dry season \u2014 which is when the majority of the fires in the Amazon have been occurring \u2014 the number of fires present this year in the Amazon calls for concern.", "Since forest fires are dangerous and difficult to predict in advance, they are primarily studied using satellite instruments.", "Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) counted more than 41,000 \u201cfire spots\u201d between 1 January and 24 August, compared with 22,000 in the same period last year. The Global Fire Emissions Database, a collaboration between NASA \u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and two universities, sees a similar trend.", "The numbers are the highest since 2010 when the Amazon experienced a severe drought triggered by El Ni\u00f1o and a warming of the North Atlantic Ocean. However, climatic anomalies do not explain the current uptick in fires.", "Could the fires be from burning crops or pastures?", "Many of the recently detected spots are active for more than a day, burning with intense heat and producing tall, thick, smoke pillars \u2014 all indicators that trees are on fire, not overgrown pastures, crop residues, or roadside vegetation.", "An analysis of the fires was presented in October 2019 at FOSS4G using MODIS satellite data \u2014 one of the major sources of information about forest fires. The presentation and GitHub repository of these results can be found here:", "On October 8th, 2019, several authors sent a letter to the editor of a prominent environmental journal called Global Change Biology which used these data sources to assess the extent and cause of these fires.", "The important contribution of deforestation\u2010related fires was consistent with media footage of large\u2010scale fires in deforested areas, while the enormous plumes of smoke that reached high into the atmosphere can only be explained by the combustion of large amounts of biomass.", "The unusual nature of 2019 was also emphasized by exceptionally high fire counts in some protected areas, such as Jamanxim National Forest where active fires increased by 355% from 2018 to 2019, 44% above the long\u2010term average (BDQueimadas & INPE, 2019)", "The main data source used to examine fires in the Amazon rainforest is DETER-b (Detec\u00e7\u00e3o de Desmatamento em Tempo Real) \u2014 a real-time deforestation detection service of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) of the Brazilian Ministry for Science and Technology.", "The system uses data obtained from the MODIS sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua NASA satellites. It sends alerts over 6.25 hectares deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The data serves as an indication of the rate of deforestation but does not represent the whole area cut down, which is measured by the PRODES system of the Global Forest Watch.", "PRODES historically used Landsat 5 images, but now also incorporates imagery from Landsat 7 and 8, CBERS-2, CBERS-2B, Resourcesat-1, and UK2-DMC. PRODES is operated by INPE in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA).", "When looking at the yearly active fire counts in Figure 1(b), the uptick does not seem particularly extreme compared to previous years. The major difference is that this year had no El Ni\u00f1o or other climate anomalies to provide an explanation for this increase.", "In September 2019, Bolsonaro declared a moratorium on burning which essentially stopped all burning. This, combined with the troops he sent into the interior to tackle fires for 60 days, led to a substantial reduction of fires in September 2019, although it is difficult to definitively say that this was the cause of the reduction.", "Data published in Nature shows a similar story, but provides the fire count for each month in 2019.", "An article from November 6th, 2019 from NASA found that some of the fires burning in the Amazon Basin this summer were concentrated in water-stressed areas of the rainforest.", "The stressed plants released measurably less water vapor into the air than unstressed plants; in other words, they were struggling to stay cool and conserve water, leaving them more vulnerable to the fires.", "The fire icons represent fires imaged by NASA\u2019s Terra satellite between Aug. 19 and 26.", "\u201cTo the naked eye, the fires appear randomly distributed throughout the forest. But, if you overlay the ECOSTRESS data, you can see that the fires are mainly confined within the highly water-stressed areas. The fires avoided the low-stress areas where the forest appears to have access to more water.\u201d \u2014 Josh Fisher, ECOSTRESS science lead at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory", "It is still unknown why certain plants become stressed whilst others do not, but it is suspected to depend on aspects such as plant species or water content of the soil.", "One of the best resources to study fires is the Global Forest Watch, which provides a dashboard GUI to study changes in climate, land-use, and other variables that influence forest ecosystems. We can use the Global Forest Watch Fires to analyze fires specifically.", "If one looks at the number of fires alerts by province between June 1st and the end of November 2019, the majority of fires are occurring in the states that are part of the Amazon rainforest.", "The same database also tells us the proportion of these fires that were set on WDPA projected areas, which is 18\u201320% depending on the time period analyzed.", "We can also distinguish between fires that happen within intact forest landscape areas and those that happen in places that have already been disturbed. A fire in a previously untouched part of the forest will have a bigger impact on biodiversity than a fire that\u2019s happening on a farmer\u2019s plot of cultivated land.", "We can also look at the seasonal progression of fires and see how it compares to previous years using MODIS fire alerts. Fires are more prevalent towards the end of the year as this is when the dry season peaks.", "We see that 2019 was not a particularly bad year in terms of the number of fire alerts compared to some years. However, the worst years occurred in years associated with El Nino and severe droughts, or the aftermath of such years when the ecosystem is still recovering.", "We can also assess how \u2018unusual\u2019 the fire alerts were for a given month based on the MODIS data. It seems from the results that August and September had particularly high fire alerts compared to the rest of the year, which were below average compared to previous years during the dry season.", "The steep drop off in fires after September could be partly due to the 2-month moratorium put in place by president Bolsonaro to tackle the fires after growing international pressure.", "We can also analyze the fires using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), one of the key instruments onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) spacecraft.", "The VIIRS provides us with near real-time data about forest fires and can be accessed here.", "The data from VIIRS can be combined with information about how many fires were occurring within intact forest landscapes, which have a greater impact on emissions and their influence on biodiversity, as previously discussed.", "The VIIRS data tells us that many fires were occurring in Rondonia whilst relatively few were happening in Amazonas. This data corroborates well with the data from the Global Forest Watch which tells us that only 4% of fires occurred within intact forest landscapes.", "We can also examine some data related to Brazilian forest fires and examine the situation ourselves. We will use data collected by the Brazilian Government from the Sistema Nacional de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es Florestais. To obtain up to date plots of Brazil and its states, we use a shapefile from the \"GADM database of Global Administrative Areas\".", "Note: I would have provided an analysis of MODIS data, but these datasets are in the realm of several hundred gigabytes and notoriously difficult to preprocess and analyze. However, if you are interested in this topic I would recommend downloading some satellite data and playing around with it.", "The Jupyter notebook and data corresponding to this analysis can be found in my GitHub repository (link at the end).", "The first thing we might be interested in is which regions have the most fires.", "The 10 municipalities with the highest rate of fire activity are also the ones where the forest disappeared most rapidly this year, according to the Amazon Environmental Research Institute in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil.", "How does the total number of fires measure up to the data presented in Figure 1(b) and from the Nature article that we discussed previously?", "It turns out, not particularly well. The data between 2011 and 2017 in Figure 1(b) show that numbers should fluctuate between 10,000 and 40,000 fire counts. When we look at the data from Nature, we see these values fluctuate between 40,000 and 80,000 fires.", "This discrepancy is likely due to the different databases, the resolution of the measurements, and what constitutes \u2018a fire\u2019. If we look at the yellow line in Figure 1(b), we see that our results agree reasonably well after 2011. This helps to illustrate one difficulty that comes from comparing fire measurements and the ways they can be interpreted.", "If we plot the average fire count for each state and superimpose this on a graph of Brazil, we can see how the number of fires has evolved over the past decade. Certain years see much more fires and these correspond with years of drought as a result of ENSO.", "How about the average number of fires per day across all states?", "We again see that results in the early years appear to be particularly low, this is likely due to insufficient ability to make accurate measurements because of technological limitations.", "Years following droughts have lower numbers of fires, likely because the ecosystem is still recovering from the stresses associated with a drought.", "To achieve more informative results, perhaps a better indicator is whether the state is part of \u2018Amaz\u00f4nia Legal\u2019, which corresponds to the nine states of Brazil which are part of the Amazon Basin.", "By labeling the states as part of the Amaz\u00f4nia Legal, we find that Mato Grosso has the most fires of all states by a large margin and some of the states with large numbers of fires are not part of this region.", "If we look at the data for each month, we see that a lot of the fires occur in regions that are not part of the Amaz\u00f4nia Legal.", "Based on the discussion from the NASA article, we might suspect there would be a correlation between precipitation in the region and the number of fires. We use precipitation data to assess this.", "The data shows that most of the precipitation occurs in the states that are part of the Amaz\u00f4nia Legal, which are part of the Amazon tropical rainforest. Despite the high levels of humidity in these areas, and the high levels of precipitation, we still receive around half of all fires in Brazil in these regions.", "How does precipitation vary over the year?", "According to the precipitation values, the peak of the dry season occurs in October, and the peak of the wet season occurs in April. How well does this correlate with the number of fires that are seen month to month?", "There is not much agreement between the number of fires and the amount of precipitation, although this is a barebones analysis of the situation and does not take into account many nuances that could influence the results. However, even if the majority of the fires were man-made, we would expect to see a marked increase in fires at the start of the dry season.", "The largest numbers of fires do occur in the dry season, which is as we suspected.", "A famous article in 2018 called \u2018Amazon Tipping Point\u2019, published by Thomas Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre, two prominent scientists whose work focuses on the Amazon rainforest, which described the influence of deforestation on the future of the forest ecosystem:", "We believe that negative synergies between deforestation, climate change, and widespread use of fire indicate a tipping point for the Amazon system to flip to non-forest ecosystems in eastern, southern and central Amazonia at 20\u201325% deforestation.", "The severity of the droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2015\u201316 could well represent the first flickers of this ecological tipping point. These events, together with the severe floods of 2009, 2012 (and 2014 over SW Amazonia), suggest that the whole system is oscillating. For the last two decades the dry season over the southern and eastern Amazon has been increasing.
