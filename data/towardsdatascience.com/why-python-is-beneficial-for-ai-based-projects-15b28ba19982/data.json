Chatbots, virtual assistants, voice search, and other innovations that factor into the market are increasing the revenue of the business and at the same time improving the customers\u2019 experience. If you thought to start own AI-based project, then you\u2019d work out a strategy, the programming language (further PL) for coding and all other processes beforehand.", "There are no doubts that AI technologies are the future. Considering the increasing popularity of the trend and the number of people ready to invest in it, the global AI market is going to reach $89.8 billion by 2025.", "The PL is what you should think about at first. The complexity of coding as well as the availability of the experienced and qualified developers are crucial moments to take into account as well. You\u2019re to deal and process a host of data effectively when it comes to AI industry, and here we offer you to check out at least 8 reasons why you\u2019d choose Python to develop your AI-powered projects.", "Being OOP-based, an API from the utilized PL is given by Python easing the learning process and reducing the time needed for a new developer to pick up the basics and start to code for AI apps. Also, it has a simple syntax and resembles actual English, that allows even junior or inexperienced Python developers to work with complex systems.", "The huge prebuilt libraries for every need are the next reasons that make Python so perfect for AI projects. Choose any to match your demands. So if your project requires advanced computing, then SciPy is what you need, for scientific computation \u2014 NumPy and for ML you\u2019d better use Pybrain. And the leader is AIMA or \u201cAI: Modern Approach\u201d that is going to save your budget by shortening the time needed for your developers on coding. That\u2019s only a part of built-in libraries to use for your AI-based project. And that\u2019s the highlight of Python.", "Based on OOP and focused on RAD, DRY, Python is pretty adaptive to changes without the risk of duplication of logic. Your choice is: to script or use OOPs. The developers change a few lines of the code and get fast results. No recompiling of the source code is required. Besides that, there is an opportunity to utilize different algorithms and languages along with Python thanks to the capability to check the code in the IDE itself.", "The next highlight of Python to observe is platform independence. Several changes can be implemented in the codes and in the way the AI application can be up and run in a new OS whatever it\u2019s. It\u2019s bound to save time for migrating the code and testing the app on the different platforms like Windows, Linux, MacOS, Unix or any other. The process becomes easier and more apparent, and, as a result, the costs are reduced.", "The next strong feature adds even more flexibility to the Python for the AI projects is high compatibility with other languages and various platforms. Thanks to the Python Package Index (PyPI) which contains lots of third-party modules allows Python to interact with other languages. It simplifies the work for developers and saves your money.", "The unique thing is a great developer community support of Python. It\u2019s an open source platform that gives you access to the free Python documentation online and forums that are open for newbies and experts. There you can get a lot of useful info, libraries and tools as well as take part in discussions, solve problems, find procedures to fix errors and just get help in various issues of every phase of the development in two ticks.", "As we\u2019ve written above, Python has a variety of built-in libraries. The other great thing is that part of them are nothing but visualization tools. It gives an opportunity to the developers to represent the data accessible for non-programmers by means of histograms, for instance. In such a way, you can get an effective presentation of data and comprehensible reports to visualize the process that eases your control on every level.", "Nobody can ignore the benefits of Python listed above. All that provokes the increasing popularity of the PL that is going to grow until 2020 relying on the figures provided by StackOverflow. Today it\u2019s much easier to find and/or replace a highly experienced Python programmer than find a skilled LISP or Prolog specialist, for instance. What\u2019s more, the costs will be lower in this case.", "If you\u2019re ready to start your own AI project, all left to do is to choose the industry to implement your future application. It\u2019s where you have plenty of choices. Here we are to help you to close in and ease your decision. Below you\u2019ll find out 7 industries that are going to benefit from AI at most in the nearest future.", "One of the most promising industries to implement AI technologies is healthcare. It was reported that by 2026 up to $150 billion annually for the U.S. could be saved by means of adopting AI healthcare applications. Instant surgeries, virtual nursing assistants, an improvement on radiology tools, the automation of diagnostic tests and administrative tasks, the accuracy of treatment, prediction of disease, is a few sectors where the technology can be used.", "It\u2019s forecasted that by 2030 the banking industry will save about $1 trillion and the reduction of traditional cost will be about 22% by implementing the AI technologies. Improved and personalized customer service, managing investments, collecting financial data, using predictive analytics, risk assessments, etc. are the ways the AI can be applied in financial firms and banks.", "eSchool News reports that applying of AI technologies in education will grow by 47.5% through 2021. Using the AI apps for teaching promises the more personalized learning, greater efficiency and speed of the study, access to the augmented content, accurate planning, and a new level of mentoring, etc. It\u2019s evident that AI is going to reshape e-learning in the coming years.", "Adopting AI is a matter of survival for the agriculture industry in the world, because of the labor shortages. So, the implementation of automation technologies for lots of processes will be a great benefit for agriculture. It will reduce the costs and increase the revenue of the companies in such a way.", "The marketing can make use of AI by means of the tech stack of the processes that are made manually by employees can be automated, it can bring more efficiency and quickly analyze large data sets, for example. Gartner says that by 2020 AI technologies will be used in at least one of the sales processes by 30% of companies over the world. Besides that, according to Accenture reports, the profitability will rise by 38% by 2035 and AI will create $14 trillion of additional revenue.", "You\u2019ve definitely heard about self-driving cars, so it\u2019s about the AI technologies. However, that\u2019s not all ways to use AI technologies in the automotive industry:", "The e-commerce sales are expected to be about $4.5 trillion by 2021. And that\u2019s not without AI technologies used. Thanks to the AI the sites provides the customers with 24/7 service and assistance by means of the chatbots, improve consumers experience by analyzing the CRM data in moments with AI tech, IoT, and other examples of using AI in e-commerce.", "So, let\u2019s sum up all written above. High diversity of built-in libraries, simple syntax, readability, compatibility, rapid testing of sophisticated algorithms, accessibility to non-programmers, and other features make Python worthy of your attention. All that ease the process, save your budget and increase the popularity of Python. Taking to account all the advantages you get using the PL, the conclusion is obvious \u2014 Python is what you need to consider to your AI-based project.", "Roman Zhidkov is CTO at DDI development company. Roman is responsible for DDI\u2019s technology strategy and plays a key role in driving new tech initiatives within the company. He understands the context of the technology in terms of other technical areas, the customer\u2019s needs, the business impact, and the corporate strategy.", "Your home for data science.
