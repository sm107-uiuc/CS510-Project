Sometimes it\u2019s because they worry that something will fail, and sometimes its because they are crossing their fingers that the script will run without fault.", "But if your script takes a long time, you can end up being pretty unproductive. While you are waiting you could be writing other R code. doing something else on your computer or even something else entirely like hitting the gym, reading a book, or learning some new stuff.", "Here are four ideas that could help you.", "Many R programmers \u2014 especially beginners \u2014 do not know how to run their code outside of their active session, so they end up running their script inside their active session and just waiting until it finishes before they can do more coding.", "As of RStudio 1.2 you can take advantage of the Jobs feature. Jobs allows your to run a script in a separate R session inside RStudio. This frees up your console so you can continue to work on other code, but also allows you to view the progress of your script as it runs.", "To run your script as a local Job, look for a little pulldown menu where you see the Source button and then select \u2018Source as Local Job\u2019. While the script is running you can monitor its progress using green bars displayed in the Jobs window, and if you comment your script with code sections (comments that have at least three trailing dashes), the Job\u2019s window will display the comments as it moves through the script so you can see exactly where it\u2019s at.", "The wikifacts package is a simple package which displays randomly selected facts from Wikipedia\u2019s home page. You can install its straight from CRAN using install.packages(\"wikifacts\").", "If you occasionally insert commands from wikifacts into your script, you can read some interesting trivia as you wait for your script to execute.", "For a random fact, you just need use wiki_randomfact(), and for specific types of facts you can use wiki_didyouknow(), wiki_onthisday() and wiki_inthenews().", "The fact will be pulled from today\u2019s Wikipedia main page, or if you want to you can specify the date of a previous main page as an argument in the functions above.", "wikifacts can also pipe easily into other fun display tools like cowsay if you really want to pimp up your output.", "If you are working outside of R while your script executes, you can use the beepr package you play noises when your script finishes or when certain sections have completed. After you\u2019ve installed the package and loaded it, you can use the beep() function to play a selection of short alerts. For example, if you are a Final Fantasy nut like me, you\u2019ll like beep(\"fanfare\").", "Also, the beep_on_error() function allows you to specific an expression to test, and if the test fails your chosen sound will be played. Very handy if you are putting tests into your script.", "How frustrating is it when you set a long script to run, then head away from your computer to do something else, and then when you get back after a couple of hours you find that it failed after five minutes because of some silly error. Sound familiar?", "There are numerous email packages that can send you emails when things happen in your scripts, but I really like the textme package, which sends you a text with a message of your choice.", "textme is not currently available on CRAN but you can install it from Github using devtools::install_github(\"richpauloo/textme\"). You can find full instructions here, but basically here are the main steps:", "Here\u2019s an example of how I use textme to alert me that something went wrong:", "What other fun things do you use to help you avoid wasted time when coding?", "Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist.
