The dashboard becomes a facilitator for ongoing discussions \u2014 clients can ask questions and we can provide answers on the fly.", "Our approach begins with how we think about the production process: the business is not selling products; it\u2019s selling time on the line as if the company were renting out it\u2019s production assets.", "What the business should be asking is:", "What products should I be prioritizing on my line to increase the line\u2019s hour by hour profitability?", "What is the profit rate or EBITDA rate of every product I make and how can I relate that to key process variables?", "What we commonly find is that misled preconceptions drive which products companies prioritize. Those assumptions are due to organizational silos that divide the business team and factory operators. While the business team may know the actual cost associated with wasted material, work in progress, and changeover loss, they are removed from the issues product lines face and how that upsets cycle times. It is essential to combine the knowledge from the factory floor with the business unit to deliver accurate analytics that will improve productivity and prioritization.", "One reason for this silo effect is that many in the manufacturing industry have been slow on the uptake of the latest data methods. Lacking the digital infrastructure, they are unable to draw a thread through their entire process. Once the fragmented datasets that percolate the organization are combined, money patterns become clear. (i.e., product margin with process or cycle time data).", "To take a simple example, rank ordering every product by EBITDA and then drawing a bubble chart of EBITDA/hr with bubble size in proportion to volume, typically results in the following: high and low EBITDA tails marked by high volume products and a long plateau of net-zero products marked by low volume. Unsurprisingly, new or experimental products lack the production volume to push margins one way or the other. In several cases, however, low volume products have a very high EBITDA/hr. If these products had the proper volume, they could potentially achieve a much higher return for the organization. If we only consider EBITDA, we lose out on the insight that we should be expanding into a few key, low volume products because pound for pound they are produced more quickly.", "In one of our client analyses, we uncovered a correlation between their process\u2019s key components and product profit margin. Of the many hundreds of combinations of chemical makeup, color, shape, treatment, and other factors, we were able to determine which were winners and which were losers. By incorporating these groupings into a dashboard, we were able to ask questions on-the-fly: if we were to swap out this combination for this one, it would likely have this impact on our margin, but will it still fit within the end customer\u2019s needs \u2014 no? \u2014 well, how about this combination? And so forth. It streamlined client sessions, allowing us to quickly develop actionable plans around which segments of their process we could target, drastically increasing their profitability.", "Smart, analytics powered dashboards are an indispensable tool in telling the analytics story. When stakeholders within the organization are attempting to articulate to other business segments the priority of an initiative, they can easily revert to the data. It\u2019s one thing to have an algorithm pick out what process variables are important. It\u2019s another if it then transforms that insight into metrics and plots that can drill down and roll up the subject matter in an intuitive way. There\u2019s indispensability in creating a path down which all organizational segments can walk and speak the same language.", "To recap, we started with the fact that the manufacturing industry has been slow on the digitalization and data science uptake, but they\u2019re starting to pick it up quickly. At MFG Analytic, we want our clients to be on the forefront of that wave. The start of your digital journey begins with analytics and by fully leveraging the datasets existing within today\u2019s organization. Before spending a fortune \u201csensoring up\u201d every pump, tank, and heat exchanger in the plant, use what\u2019s already available. Find out what you know, and make your next digitalization step an informed one \u2014 one backed by data.", "Your home for data science.
