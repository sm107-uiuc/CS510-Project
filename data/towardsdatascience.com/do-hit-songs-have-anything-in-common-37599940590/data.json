It is pretty cool!", "As someone who listens to music a lot and who likes to play around with data, this inspired me to see if I could analyse my own music.", "I\u2019ve also been very curious to know if there were certain ingredients that makeup hit songs. What makes them cool? Why do we like hit songs and do hit songs have a certain \u201cDNA\u201d?", "This led me to try to answer two questions using data from Spotify in this post:", "Luckily, there are really simple tools out there to help us connect to Spotify, retrieve data and then visualise it.", "We will be using Python 3 as the programming language, Spotipy, the Python library that allows you to connect to the Spotify Web API and we will use plot.ly and Seaborn for data visualisation.", "At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year and this playlist has 100 tracks. The dataset I used was already available on Kaggle: Top Spotify Tracks of 2018 . Top 100 songs from Spotify seem like a reasonable dataset to consider as our hit songs, don\u2019t you think?", "To get started, you will need to create an account at developer.spotify.com. After that, you can access the Spotify Web API Console directly and start exploring the different API endpoints.", "Note: The link to the code I used for the entire project is at the end of the blog post.", "After connecting to the Spotify Web API, we will create a Spotify object using the Spotipy Python Library, which we will then use to query our Spotify endpoint (a bit of a mouth full, I know \ud83d\ude03).", "This is one of the most important steps in data science. Our goal here is to understand the type of music in my playlist, retrieve any interesting observations and compare that with the audio features of the top 100 songs of 2018.", "By observing this histogram, we can see how often artists appear in one of my selected playlists.", "Now let\u2019s look at the audio features of the songs in this playlist. Spotify has collated a list of audio features for every song on Spotify! Here is a summary of the features we will be using below:", "Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \u201cOoh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \u201cvocal\u201d. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater the likelihood the track contains no vocal content.", "Energy: This is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale", "Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.", "Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.", "Speechiness: \u201cSpeechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track\u201d. If the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech.", "Danceability: \u201c Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable\u201d.", "Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)", "After downloading and importing the dataset from Kaggle into our application, I started by analyzing the most popular artists in the dataset by the number of times they appeared on the list.", "Artists With Highest Appearance in Top 100 Songs 2018", "Now let\u2019s explore the audio features of the top 100 songs in our dataset to see what they look like! We will plot the same histogram as we did for my playlist so we can compare them later.", "By observing the histogram we can see that tracks in the top 100 charts are:", "For example, Drake\u2019s \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d from our dataset, is highly danceable and also has a relatively high energy value.", "Finally, I decided to plot a radar chart of the top 100 songs and superimpose the audio features of my playlist for easy comparison.", "The Top 100 songs from Spotify are in blue while my top songs are in orange.", "So I think I got the answers to both my questions at the start of this post. I got to see what my music looks like and there seems to be a DNA for hit songs. The audio features from my playlist are a bit similar to the top 100 songs but I have more acoustic songs and a few live songs.", "Want to make a hit song? Make sure it is danceable, has a lot of energy and a bit of valence (positivity and a feel-good vibes).", "I am quite happy with the results but I want to build on this in another post.", "Here are my recommended next steps:", "You can become a Medium member and enjoy more stories like this.", "You can get the code to the entire project on GitHub.", "Thanks to Alvin Chung, Ashrith and John Koh for their helpful articles on this subject.
