Here we get straight to the facts.", "It has become apparent within AI research that Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Neural Networks, in general, are not mechanisms that lend themselves readily to \u201cone-shot learning\u201d.", "Neural Networks, in general, must be trained on large sets of training data resulting in a mechanism which provides a probabilistic result based on live data that approximates the training data set.", "Train a suitable neural network on a set of images of a panda, then provide a new image of a panda and the neural network will give a probability of what it believes the new image to be, and hopefully that prediction is \u2018a panda\u2019.", "The less training data provided the neural network, no matter how optimised it is in its inner structure, the less chance that it will provide a favourable result. That is, you cannot reliably provide a suitable neural network with the picture of just one panda and expect it to recognise another and different picture of a panda. In general, it cannot learn a concept, or set of rules, in one shot.", "This is heavily contrasted with human learning, in which a person can readily grasp and apply knowledge learned, having only been introduced to the problem space once. This is true over a vast domain of problem spaces.", "One-shot learning is a recognised problem for Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and experts in the field are working on ways to overcome that problem. It seems unlikely to me that ML/DL strategies will get to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) without some form of one-shot learning.", "A problem within ML/DL approaches is that data, by way of accumulated weightings, is passed through a network of nodes and where little logic is applied to the data at each node, but rather statistics-based math is applied to the values of the accumulated weightings received by the node. The result of the applied statistical math over input data provides output data graded by probabilities, providing a probabilistic logic over the input data.", "For example, a self driving car incorporating ML/DL stops at a stop sign because it is statistically a good thing to do; because statistically that is what it has been trained to do.", "The problem with some pass-through (or feed-forward) networks based on that strategy is that if a human face statistically has a nose, eyes, mouth, eyebrows and a chin, given a picture of a \u2018face\u2019 where an eye is replaced for a nose and vice versa, and the mouth for one of the eyes (and vice versa) the network will classify the image as a face no matter how absurd the proposition. This, because the image still has a nose, eyes, mouth, eyebrows and a chin.", "Geoffrey Hinton, influential in the rise of neural networks, has realised this problem and is in the process of developing and promoting what he calls Capsule Networks that perform localised logic processing at early stage nodes within a network such that the refined weightings provided to later-stage network nodes are better tuned to provide a more realistic approximation of the classification of input data. The idea is that providing such a network with an absurd picture of a face, the network would not classify the image as a face, because localised logic early in the network requires the parts of the face to be in their anatomically correct place.", "This gets us no closer to one-shot learning but introduces the concept that network nodes must perform some form of logic beyond statistical math.", "Another problem with neural networks is that a wide range of problems are not statistical in nature, but require the finesse of predicate logic. To keep this article short, I won\u2019t argue why, but rather simply state that you may as well provide an AI directly with a model rather than trying to statistically train the AI to learn the model. I.e. Just give the AI the model in one-shot.", "Let\u2019s have a look at an example. The following Object-Role Modeling (ORM) diagram provides the details that are required to suitably track and store the booking of seats to watch a film at a cinema.", "Instantly recognisable as a graph of data, where the data is the representation of a conceptual model, the information captures a constraint necessary to book seats for a movie:", "If some Booking has some Seat, thenthat Booking is for some Session that is at some Cinema that contains some Row that contains that Seat", "Such predicate processing is beyond most neural networks because they do not contain predicate logic processing at the node level; but I feel that is where the technology must head for one-shot learning.", "Simplistic feed-forward neural networks just will not cut it when it comes to enforcing rules for models like the one above, however for an AGI such models will be commonplace.", "Localised predicate checking will be required at the node/neuron level, and intra-node.", "Fact-Based Models stored as ORM models are ideal for storing within the matrix of nodes within a neural network because of their intrinsic graph-based notation, where each node in the graph represents a piece of the logical model it represents.", "AI solutions based on predicate logic have received negative press in the past. For instance, the Cyc project has been labelled a failure in the past; purportedly because early iterations of Cyc relied exclusively on predicate logic and induction. However, the basic premise that an AGI must be able to process predicate logic is not in question. If AGI is ever to be an amalgam of predicate logic and neural networks, then predicate logic must be stored in its model. It seems that Cycorp have realised this and have started to work with deep learning and fact based reasoning.", "My research at Viev is geared towards providing the tools to construct fact-based models, the metamodel of which can be incorporated into a new wave of neural networks that incorporate logic processing at the node/neuron level.", "A benefit of using Object-Role Modelling within the logic store of an AI is that in many cases natural language generation is not required. The effort required to generate natural language is significantly reduced because ORM stores facts in natural language in the first place and in a logical structure that is a homomorphism to sentences of a first-order logic.", "In the example above, an AI responding to a general statement made by Alice, \u201cI booked a seat at the cinema\u201d, can readily identify a/the candidate model of the world that Alice is talking about, and transverse the graph to ask questions such as, \u201cWhich session was that for?\u201d, or \u201cHow many seats did you book?\u201d, \u201cWhat film was that for?\u201d, etc with extrapolation of the language already stored in the model.", "Object-Role Modeling is a type of Fact-Based Modeling and more than storing the meta information about facts, such as that people can book seats at a cinema, ORM can store actual data about those facts.", "The same model as represented above, can store the information about Alice having booked a seat at a cinema; as below and where Alice has a Person_Id of 1:", "So with Object-Role Modeling at the core of a Fact-Based AI, not only can the model be stored as data, but facts that relate to the model can be stored within the model. The model and the fact data are just data.", "Neural networks are already a graph of data. Fact-Based AI, in a nutshell, is incorporating models/schemas and their related data as nodes within that graph within a neural network or predicate logic based AI.", "I hope this has been helpful to AI researchers looking to forge a new path. As time permits I will write more on Fact-Based AI and Object-Role Modeling.", "NB The original version of the model expressed in this article is copyright to DataConstellation and is shared under the ActiveFacts project on GitHub: https://github.com/cjheath/activefacts.
