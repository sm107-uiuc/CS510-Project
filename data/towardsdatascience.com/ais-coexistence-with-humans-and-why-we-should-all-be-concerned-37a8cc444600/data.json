Many ideas are abstracted from his book and any similarities found are intentional.", "As a student, practitioner and advocate of AI, I\u2019m fortunate to get a glimpse into how the AI technology works beneath the surface, and to a certain extent also allows me to imagine what kind of possibilities we have with AI not only in the present but also in the future.", "To the man on the street, AI is seen as a technology that has the possibility to replace humans in different areas of work, and some of this displacement has already begun. What they don\u2019t see, however, is the extent at which humans and society at large will and can be affected by the AI revolution, just like how the industrial revolution and internet boom changed the way we lived dramatically.", "What scares me is the possibility that Hao Jingfang\u2019s dystopian world of the so-called \u2018AI elites\u2019 versus the rest of the world (what she deemed \u2018useless\u2019 people) [2] might become reality if people continue to be oblivious of what AI really is and what it can do.", "As a futurist, here\u2019s what I think everyone should be aware of when it comes to transitioning into an AI-driven world.", "\u201cThe invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we\u2019ve gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.\u201d", "The above quote encapsulates the prophecy that Lee has for this AI Revolution we currently live in \u2014 that 40 percent of the world\u2019s jobs are displaceable by AI technology in the next 15 to 25 years, with a key difference being the rate of change of this displacement.", "In human history, we survived the First Industrial Revolution \u2014 a massive transition to new manufacturing processes and revolutionized the way goods were produced. We then thrived during the Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution \u2014 a phase of rapid standardization and industrialization of goods and services, including areas such as railroad networks, sewage systems, electrification, maritime, automobile and many more.", "Many now coin the age we live in as the AI Revolution, and potentially what our (future) kids might know as the Third Industrial Revolution, simply because the way goods and services are consumed have massively evolved. The sheer number and types of services provided today have seen a surge in numbers relative to the number of goods produced, because the Internet has made this possible.", "Not just the Internet, but the rapid development of peripherals that support the entire Internet ecosystem and subsequently the development of AI.", "AI is a technology that thrives on problems that have a clear input and output. Typically, these are optimisation problems (supervised learning) such as credit scoring, spam classification and sentiment analysis. When the output isn\u2019t labeled (e.g. spam/not spam, positive/negative), we may also seek to do classification (unsupervised) based on what the algorithm \u2018thinks\u2019 each data point should be classified into. The aforementioned are typically traditional machine learning methods (e.g. random forests, support vector machines, logistic/linear regression, density-based models) that have been around and studied on for a long period of time.", "What is causing this AI Revolution is the proliferation and wide spread adoption of advances in deep learning technology. It is not the \u201ccreation\u201d but the adoption of this technology.", "As Lee coins it, we are not in an age of discovery but in an age of implementation. It is easy for people to be misled that AI is currently in its infancy as media continually reports on new groundbreaking results such as AlphaGo, Dota 2 and Starcraft beaten by Google\u2019s DeepMind and Elon Musk\u2019s OpenAI. Back in 2016, Lee Sedol could not even conjure the thought of a computer program beating him at Go. Today, he has retired (in 2019) from Go because he thinks that \u201ceven if [he] becomes \u2116 1, there is an entity that cannot be defeated\u201d [5].", "Following AlphaGo, professional teams in more complex real-time multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games such as Dota 2 and Starcraft were also dethroned in what people thought to be impossible tasks. In a turn-based game like Go, a computer program could possibly exhaust all the game\u2019s possible states (the state of the board or game at any given point in time) and predict what the next best move should be, training over many iterations of the game and employing various explore-exploit strategies. With MOBA games, these game states exponentiate to (possibly) infinity, including additional complexities like game theory, imperfect information, long-term planning and real-time multi-player interactions [3]. What people did not know, however, is that these breakthroughs were in fact different applications of the same underlying technology.", "Deep learning employs the use of neural networks \u2014 a unique way of parsing inputs through a certain network structure \u2013 to train a model to understand the linear and non-linear relationship between input and output. Neural networks are an attempt to mimic the neurons in our brains in a similar structure, with weights acting as the amount of importance we place on each feature (factor) when we make decisions. This ability to capture non-linearities is a key differentiator from traditional machine learning models which are mostly linear in nature.", "Why wasn\u2019t the technology adopted earlier?", "Even though deep learning has been around since the 2000s, the community did not recognise it till 2016 when a team of AI Researchers led by Yann LeCun (one of the Godfathers of AI) surpassed the benchmark error rate in the largest image recognition competition in the world, ImageNet. Back then, there was little adoption due to a combination of lack of research funding, computational power and recognition.", "Today, with GPUs and TPUs powering our AI systems, people are able to take that open source technology and apply it to many different domains. What used to be a field dominated by PhDs now no longer had that same barrier to entry because while advancing technology requires advanced technical skills, application of technology does not require that same level of rigorousness. Herein lies the beauty of open source technology, where building blocks are provided for people to experiment and even improve upon.", "With this new technology, we can see the rapid application of deep learning across different industries \u2014 from manufacturing to retail to banking, and from blue-collared workers to white. The age of AI is an age of change, an age where disruption may become the new normalcy. Every so often, we see industries being disrupted, operations being topsy-turvied, and our roads potentially being populated with autonomous vehicles.", "Lee broadly categorizes jobs into two distinct categories \u2014 physical and cognitive labour. In both charts below, the vertical-axis describes the level of social involvement in a job.", "The first chart represents the risk of replacement for physical-laboured jobs, with the horizontal-axis describing the level of structure in the environment. As described earlier, AI is great at learning tasks where the input has some form of relationship to the output (i.e. approximating f(x) = y). Needless to say, rule-based jobs are the easiest to replace as it does not require AI but simple automation.", "The second chart represents the risk of replacement for cognitive-laboured jobs, with the horizontal-axis describing the level of creativity involved.", "One can observe some similarities between physical and cognitive laboured jobs \u2014 rule-based jobs (physical or cognitive) that involves repetitive work and little social interaction are more at risk compared to jobs that have some element of unpredictability or require out-of-the-box thinking.", "While more \u2018traditional\u2019 jobs can be replaced, my view is that a large proportion of these 40% of jobs affected are displaced, rather than replaced.", "AI was never created to do the jobs of humans \u2014 not completely at least. Robots were created for that purpose. What\u2019s the difference you might ask? The way I see it, robots represent the physical entity that AI can reside in. In other words, AI represents the \u2018brains\u2019 of robots. The reason why tradition jobs can be replaced is because all that is required is a robot with a \u2018rule-based brain\u2019. That is the reason why the industrial revolution occured and transformed the way goods were produced.", "With AI however, the problems we attempt to solve are exponentially (perhaps infinitely) harder. In the medical scene, AI is largely used in the stages of diagnosis and even drug development and patient monitoring. The use of image recognition is more prevalent in healthcare because image recognition has become so good so fast. This is typically performed on X-ray images to identify anomalies when detecting signs of breast cancer and even Covid-19. In the former, it has been identified that AI \u2018outperforms\u2019 doctors diagnosing breast cancer by a reduction of 1.2% in false positives and 2.7% in false negatives [6].", "In banking, AI is used to identify anomalies in transactions (i.e. fraud) and approve loans. In maritime, AI is used to identify objects at sea to prevent collision. In e-commerce, AI is used to predict what items you might potentially buy. On sites where we consume content, AI is used to recommend items we might want to watch or read. On our iPhones, AI is used to autocomplete our text, answer our questions (a.k.a. question and answering in NLP) we type on Google search and even set our alarms for us using voice recognition when we\u2019re too lazy to do so ourselves.", "The bottom line here is \u2014 AI complements the way we do things because it abstracts away the emotional elements we may have to provide an objective opinion. In breast cancer diagnosis, multiple radiologists are required to make a judgment, especially when those judgments differ. Individual radiologists can only go through a limited number of X-rays in their lifetime and are bounded by fatigue and prone to error. An AI system can go through that same number of X-rays in a day, work 24/7 and provide a similar or even higher level of accuracy. This holds true for other jobs as well.", "However, displacement is inevitable as the number of personnel required to do the same job will decrease. New complementary jobs will arise to aid this transition, such as personnel required to understand how to operate these AI driven technologies.", "How are we reacting and more importantly, adapting to these changes created by AI?", "It is scary if we don\u2019t know what it is capable of. It is also scary if we sit idly and let our jobs be displaced or worse still, replaced by AI.", "On an individual level, we must be aware of the capabilities and possibilities of what AI can do. It is important to think about how our livelihoods can possibly be impacted by AI. We lose out and risk being replaced or displaced if we choose not to understand what AI really is.", "On a national level, countries need to start thinking and exploiting whatever data they have. Governments play a huge role in driving the adoption of AI and technology in general, as how China accelerated from being a technology laggard to an AI Superpower in a span of decades. AI has a \u2018winner-takes-all\u2019 tendency, as early movers can grow a large user base, and that itself generates data, resulting in a self-perpetuating cycle.", "We take responsibility on every level \u2014 individual, corporate and national level. Individually, it is our responsibility to keep up with this AI Revolution. Upskilling has never been more important. With the vast amount of resources available on the Internet, learning virtually any skill is now possible.", "At a corporate and national level, change usually comes from the top. Senior management and ministers in cabinet needs to encourage and set aside budget to encourage innovation. Talent management is of utmost importance as well, as AI talent is scarce and fluid.", "On a global level, it is perhaps inevitable that there will be a few AI tycoons (corporations and countries that dominate in AI) in the world. This will no doubt create a growing disparity between the rich and the poor, and the first and third world countries. With great power comes great responsibility (yes, cheesy I know) \u2014 I do hope that these AI tycoons can work together to bridge this gap domestically and across borders.", "The truth is, AI today is not as good as many imagine it but not as bad we fear it to be. More often than not, we fear what we do not fully grasp.", "In Lee\u2019s book, he describes Autonomous AI as the fourth wave of AI (the first being Internet AI, second being Business AI and third being Perception AI). It represents the fusing of a machine\u2019s ability to optimize from extremely complex data sets with their newfound sensory powers [1]. Simply put, it is when machines are given the ability to make decisions based on the things it senses (be it sight or sound). These are in stark contrast to machineries which simply run based on a set of rules.", "The closest thing we have today is autonomous vehicles. However, there are still many considerations and implications when talk about autonomous AI, with AI ethics and governance playing a huge role. For full AI autonomy to occur, we would have to look beyond our lifetime to imagine the possibilities.", "The way AI is shaping our world amazes me everyday and I hope that this article does shed a light on how integrated our lives are with AI today. More importantly, understanding the impact of AI on us as individuals, workers and global citizens is fundamental to creating a much more equitable world that future generations can live in.", "If you haven\u2019t read Lee Kai-Fu\u2019s \u2018AI Superpowers\u2019, I strongly suggest you do!", "Support me! \u2014 If you like my content and are not subscribed to Medium, do consider supporting me and subscribing via my referral link here (NOTE: a portion of your membership fees will be apportioned to me as referral fees).", "[1] AI Superpowers \u2014 China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, Kai-Fu Lee", "[2] AI Superpowers versus All the Rest", "[3] AlphaStar: Mastering the Real-Time Strategy Game StarCraft II", "[6] AI \u2018outperforms\u2019 doctors diagnosing breast cancer", "Your home for data science.
