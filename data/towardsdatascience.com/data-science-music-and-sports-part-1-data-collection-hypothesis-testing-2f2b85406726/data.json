In the following posts we describe the experiment we have performed to assess the impact of music on running. Through the statistical analysis of synchronized time series, and machine learning, we develop a personalized song recommender system that could improve your running performance.", "In Part 1 (you are here) we cover the experimental setup, the data collection and processing, and a first assessment of the impact of music on running.", "In Part 2 we present the feature engineering, the validation schema, the regression models, and the construction of the recommender system.", "Have you ever wondered if the music you listen to while exercising has any measurable effect on your performance? Trying to find the answer to this question has been a good motivation to exercise through weeks of confinement, and the perspective of uncertain and predominantly solitary training sessions to come. In these blog posts we describe a case study that targets the development of a music recommender system to enhance sports performance. We combine the analysis of music records using a popular streaming app, and the physical data recorded during the running exercises via a well known sports watch brand. We focus on the data science building blocks behind the complete solution workflow, rather than on coding. However, we indicate some libraries and functions useful to reproduce the workflow within a Python environment. Well, only after you exercise your running capabilities for several weeks ;).", "The data science principles we cover here apply to solutions that leverage time series with multiple purposes: to monitor the health status; to enhance driving safety; to improve focus during sensitive activities; to boost working performance; or to just get the most of your preferred sports training. They apply to solutions in fields like supply chain demand, sales forecasting, trading, or medical and drug testing to mention real world applications.", "For the experiment we have recorded the data of running exercises for several weeks. The plots and numbers quoted here are based on a single runner (N=1 statistical analysis); we have followed an analogous setup for a second runner to further validate the process.", "Running with smart devices, we are already dealing with one of the most challenging parts in any data science project: data recording. This study includes 52 different exercise records. The data from the sports watch contains GPS, accelerometer, and heart rate sensor data (optical wrist sensors). At the same time, we collect and synchronize the data of the music streamed during the exercise (if any). We also collect weather data from the closest station to the training location. This leads to a combination of time series with a sample rate of a second, except for the weather data whose variation within a running exercise we neglect.", "After processing the data, we first attempt a simplified hypothesis test to assess the impact of music on running performance. Its results indicate that a multivariate analysis is needed for that. Consequently, we train a set of regressor algorithms that aim to predict the running performance in each next time interval of a running exercise. They base the predictions on all data recorded up to that point in time. We check if the addition of features related to the music played during the exercise improves the predictive power of the algorithms. We study the (adjusted) coefficient of determination for this, as the coefficient speaks about the strength of the dependence between a response variable (running performance) and the predictor features. By studying if the music features improve the coefficient, we can assess the actual impact of music on running. We take advantage of the regressors, and build a solution that selects which is the song that would maximize at each time the performance on a running exercise, recommending it for streaming.", "There are many caveats to consider in the process, we cover them throughout the post. The most limiting of them all is the sample of participants in the experiment. Only two runners have taken part in it, so the results here speak of the impact of music on their running performance. Furthermore, a generalizable experimental design would have targeted a repetition of running exercises, minimizing the variation of all conditions, except for changes on the music being streamed. This is, exercising at the same time of the day, with the same weather conditions, same preliminar fatigue, same track with fixed distance and elevation, and performing the same type of test. Keeping such a monotonous setup for a single person and literally thousands of running minutes would have defeated the motivation we had for experimenting with ourselves. Instead, we decided to train following a varied running plan. While this will have an effect when assessing the impact of music on performance, generalizing the experiment was not in the scope of this initial study. We still hope the pipeline, workflow, and discussed ideas, will inspire a future generalizable approach.", "For each of the running exercises we use a Polar device (Polar Vantage M) to record the running physical variables. Analogous experiments could have been performed with alternative devices, such as from Garmin or Suunto for instance. For each exercise, the sports watch records the GPS track, the heart rate and the running cadence with a sample rate of a second. After syncing the device with the Polar flow app, the recorded data is available to be consumed by the user.", "For the automated data collection we use the official Polar Accesslink API. For several of the developed functions we exploit the public python wrapper around the API. The API works under a transaction schema to fetch the recorded data, take a careful look at the implications on data availability and the best practices to retrieve exercises. In order to fetch any user data (including exercise records), each user must accept the relevant access permissions for the developed application prior to the data collection. Only then new exercises become accessible to your new app.", "As illustrated with the exercise in the figure above, using the API we recover the data from the several Polar device sensors. For this experiment, instead of using the raw GPX track files, we consume the speed as provided directly by the API, together with the heart hate, altitude and running cadence. The mean duration (distance) of the exercises is 56 minutes (11 kms) per exercise, with a total record of 2200 minutes (131974 seconds given the device sampling rate). Instead of a repetition of the exact same exercise, we decided to follow a varied training plan. The exercises include base runs, progression runs, tempo runs, hill runs, and fartleks (as is the case of the exercise in the figure). The structure of the sessions is usually similar: a warm-up of around 25 minutes, the main exercise, and a short recovery run at the end. These three phases can be observed in the figure above.", "The fact that we are not testing the running performance in a controlled manner adds a complication to the experiment. How do we define and measure running performance? During the running exercises we are not aiming to run as fast as possible on a specific track. This means, we can not just use the time needed to cover a track as a measure of performance. Instead, we need to define a running performance metric that is valid for all those varied fartleks, base, progression, tempo and hill runs.", "In order to define the running performance metric, we study the heart rate and the running speed. As it can be found in the literature (have a look here and references therein), the relation between these two variables can be related to improvements with exercise. The idea is that during high intensity running, if we manage to keep a constant speed, the heart rate tends to increase with time. Conversely, if we run at a constant heart rate, the speed ends decreasing with time. Furthermore, after endurance training, the heart rate during steady-state submaximal exercise decreases with time. Therefore, we can assume the relation between heart rate and speed is a proxy to assess running performance and the effects of training over time. We start with a naive definition of a metric we call running efficiency:", "With the proper units, the efficiency is just the distance we advance per heart beat. Notice that when looking at two different runners, comparing their efficiencies defined this way may not be useful to assess who is a better runner. However, here we always compare the efficiency of a runner at a certain time versus its own efficiencies at other times. This way, significant improvements on the efficiency may be related to improvements on performance.", "This definition so far neglects an important variable: the elevation gain. In order to include its effect, we use a Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) model. The idea of these models is to find the equivalent speed that a runner would achieve with the same effort, but when running on flat ground instead of the actual gradient. As for the specific GAP model, we based it on the one shown by Strava here. Given the altitudes and distances of the current and prior time stamps, we compute the gradient. The gradient sets the pace adjustment by looking at the GAP model curve; once this is multiplied with the speed, we get the GAP speed. This is indeed the quantity we use for the final definition. After some empirical observations, we also decided to use the difference of the heart rate with respect to the resting pulse of the runner:", "As illustration, in the figure above we show the Gap efficiency distribution for the same fartlek exercise before. We note that the sports watch devices we use for the experiment do not have a barometer. The altitude is measured based on GPS signals, what is a source of uncertainty. To deal with this, we train a simple anomalous detection algorithm based on a k-means clustering approach. We look at the speed, heart rate and altitude to decide if an altitude measurement is accepted as valid, or if it is an imprecise measurement instead. If it is not accepted, the GAP correction is set to 1, so that the GAP speed is just the raw speed. In addition, we set the maximum correction to a gradient of 17%, as that is the largest gradient we have run according to the known maps of the tracks. In any case, most of the exercises were flat to avoid biases caused by incorrect altitude readings, or just the unfitness to run on hill conditions.", "In the figure above, we illustrate the scatter plot of the GAP efficiency versus the exercise time for all of the exercises from one of the participants. For the plot, we resample the GAP efficiencies taking the average GAP efficiency over a minute. We remove minutes without enough movement, corresponding to phases like stretching after warming up. After combining all the different recorded exercises there is no longer a noticeable exercise structure. In contrast to the fartlek in the previous figure, whose phases were still somewhat visible in the GAP efficiency plot. What shows up in the scatter plot is the tendency of the GAP efficiency to decrease with the time of the exercise: notice the negative trend on the plotted points. This is expected given the definition of the GAP efficiency and the findings mentioned above. The variations on the vertical axis are a consequence of the type of training, the weather conditions, the preliminar fatigue, and maybe the music streamed as we will assess. These variations are also due to continued endurance training. After weeks of carrying with the experiment, our GAP efficiencies have had a tendency to go up.", "We note that there is a clear correlation between the mean GAP efficiency of an exercise and the Running Index as provided by Polar. Some discrepancies appear on steep hill runs, in those the Running Index seems to underestimate the effort with respect to the GAP efficiency (or vice versa). However, the overall trend across exercises is the same.", "Beyond the polar-accesslink wrapper, the processing of the exercise data can be done with Pandas, including common functions for time series (like shift and rolling), plus some of the functions in the datetime module, and your preferred implementation of k-means (e.g. from sklearn).", "The treatment of the anomalous readings from the Polar sensors may be challenging. Some of those readings are inherent to the limited accuracy of the sports watch, like the altitude measurements we have discussed already. The speed and heart rate measurements are usually stable and less problematic. Notice that pausing your watch while exercising will prevent any accurate synchronization with the data recorded from the music streaming app. We avoided pausing the exercise record on the device, and used the lap options instead. As a consequence, a special treatment is required for some exercise phases: right after the start, when stretching, stopping on traffic lights etc. Finding and correcting these for the regression models we describe in Part 2 requires a bit of imagination, plus some more anomalous detection. Nothing too sophisticated though.", "For the music records we use the Spotify app. Notice that a fraction of the exercises are completed without any music in order to have silent exercises to compare to. The music played while running is retrieved in an automated way using the official Spotify API. For some functions we use a publicly available Python wrapper, Spotipy. There is an authorization schema that must be followed to retrieve any data from the API. Particularly, as we are interested in getting not just music features, but also the songs played by specific users, these must provide the proper permissions beforehand.", "In order to get the music features for an exercise, we retrieve the most recent songs played by the corresponding user. Watch out since the quotas are quite limited, better get the songs automatically after each exercise. Once we have the songs played (and their timestamps), we need to get some song features. These are some quantitative descriptors to characterize the songs, so that we can estimate their impact into the running performance. For this, any music lover may find the Spotify API fascinating, as it offers a vast catalogue of music information. The analysis of music is indeed a dynamic field with promising advances, check out for instance recent music generation developments using Deep Learning. However, an in depth analysis of the songs goes beyond the initial focus of this experiment. Instead, we directly use the list of music features as computed and provided by the Spotify API. Have a look at their definitions here.", "The song features include basic descriptors like the duration of the song (needed to synchronize the Polar and Spotify records), the tempo, the estimated overall key using numerical notation (standard pitch class), the modality, the time signature, the record loudness, and a list of numerical attributes that further describe the song. Things like the energy, defined as a perceptual measure of intensity and activity; the instrumentalness and the speechiness, related to the presence of vocals on the song; a feature related to the detection of audiences on a record, the liveness; the acousticness; and features for other aspects of the rhythm, the tempo, the stability and regularity of the songs, like the valence or the danceability.", "The lack of control on the computation of these features may seem like a limitation. However, they are directly available through the API, and they are linked to intuitive definitions, which are sufficient for the scope of our initial solution. We leave an in depth exploration of alternative music features for the future. In the bottom panels of the figure above, we depict the key, energy and tempo of the songs played during the fartlek exercise. These are step-like time series, as variations within a song are not considered. We let Spotify play songs based on several playlists of a different nature. We actively choose to play varied music to enrich the experiment.", "Beyond the use of the Spotify API, you may need Pandas again. Special care is needed to sync the music data with the sports watch records.", "Once the data collection process is in place, we proceed to study if there are differences on the measured GAP efficiency values between the exercises with music being streamed, and the ones without. The distributions for the GAP efficiency show a similar shape for both types of exercises. However, the mean GAP efficiency for the exercises with music is a bit larger than for the rest of exercises. To assess the statistical significance of this difference we perform a hypothesis test. We first have to deal with the fact that the GAP efficiency show sizable autocorrelations. These are particularly significant up to lags of around 45 seconds. They are a consequence of the GAP efficiency being defined based on the heart rate, which is reactive to running efforts.", "This is visible in the left panel of the figure above. There, we show the GAP efficiency autocorrelation function for the running exercise we are using for illustration. The autocorrelation decreases and stops being significant above lags of around 45 seconds. There are minor secondary peaks due to the structure of the exercise. For the fartlek above, there is a significant positive autocorrelation for lags of around 360 seconds. And a third (barely) significant negative autocorrelation at around 120 seconds. These are due to the fartlek being structured in 6 intervals of 4 minutes at high intensity, followed by 2 minutes of slow pace running. Note that when considering all exercises together, the combination of differently structured fartleks, base, progression, tempo and hill runs, removes any significant autocorrelation other than the initial one for small lags.", "The presence of autocorrelations affects the construction of the statistical test. A Student\u2019s t-test for instance assumes the sample of measurements to be independent, but when sizable autocorrelations are present this is not held. The resulting effect would be an underestimate of the sample variances, as we would wrongly assume to have more measurements than the ones we effectively have. As the variance appears in the denominator of the test statistic, this would get inflated leading to unjustified rejections of the null hypothesis. In plain words, with a regular Student\u2019s t-test we would conclude there are significant differences between the GAP efficiencies of exercises with music versus the rest of exercises, if we did not take autocorrelations into account. To deal with this, we implement an adapted test as described here. The idea is to account for the autocorrelations computing variance inflation factors that are included in the test statistics. These corrections are also referred to as decorrelations of time or adjusted effective sample sizes.", "After this adjustment, the results of the modified t-test show that when including all recorded data points, the differences on the GAP efficiencies between exercises with music and without are not statistically significant. However, this is still too much of a simplified test. The test does not take into account the effect of all the other variables in the experiment. What if we compare the effect of music on the GAP efficiencies depending on the running speed for instance? This is what we show in the right panel of the figure above. We depict the p-value from the variance inflated t-test, as a function of a minimum required speed to include the data points in the test. Interestingly, once we start focusing on exercise phases with a higher speed, the p-values decrease. This is, the differences between listening to music or not become more significant. This happens up to around 16km/h, where the differences are touching the 95% Confidence Level. For higher speeds, the difference starts to dilute, and the p-values increase again.", "A reasonable explanation would be that when we consider all data points, including slow phases (warm ups, recoveries etc), the test shows no significant effects of the music on the GAP efficiency. But when we speed up to sub-maximal efforts, the streaming of music plays some effect and the difference on GAP efficiencies becomes bigger. Until we reach a speed (and thus an effort) too high for the music to play a role anymore. This is aligned with some existing literature on the effect of music on sports, check for dissociation here. While the explanation is interesting, the test we have performed is still too simplistic to be conclusive. But it points to the need of a holistic consideration of variables to assess the impact of music on running performance. This motivates further the multivariate analysis using regressors we present in Part 2 of this blog series.", "The study of correlations between variables, and other initial descriptive analysis, shed more light on these differences. But to limit the size of this post, we do not explicitly present them here. The findings appear reflected in the second part of the blog series.", "In order to compute the autocorrelation functions we use functions within the statsmodel module, for instance plot_acf. For the variance inflated t-test we implement our own test, but using the scipy.stats module for the t-test cumulative distribution function.", "Wearables offer us the possibility to continuously record data during physical exercises. We have described how we can collect and process the data of our running exercises as recorded by a Polar device and the Spotify app. We have presented a simplified analysis of the impact of music on running performance. The data set we construct will be used in the second part of the blog series to assess this further, and to build a music recommender system that could improve our running performance.", "Continue with Part 2: Regressions and Recommender System", "None of the brands mentioned here have been directly involved in this experiment", "Your home for data science.
