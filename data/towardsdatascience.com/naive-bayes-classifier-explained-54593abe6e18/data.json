The math behind it is quite easy to understand and the underlying principles are quite intuitive. Yet this model performs surprisingly well in many cases and this model and its variations are used in many problems. So in this article, we are going to explain the math and the logic behind the model and also implement a Naive Bayes Classifier in Python and Scikit-Learn.", "This article is part of a mini-series of two about the Naive Bayes Classifier. This will cover the theory, maths and principles behind the classifier. If you are more interested in the implementation using Python and Scikit-Learn, please read the other article, Naive Bayes Classifier Tutorial in Python and Scikit-Learn.", "Classification tasks in Machine Learning are responsible for mapping a series of inputs X = [x1, x2, \u2026, xn] to a series of probabilities Y = [y1, y2, \u2026, ym]. This means that given one particular set of observation X = (x1, x2, \u2026, xn), we need to find out what is the odd that Y is yi and in order to obtain a classification, we just need to choose the highest yi.", "Yeah, I know, I also don\u2019t like these things explained this way. I know a formal explanation is necessary, but let\u2019s also try it in another way. Let\u2019s have this fictional table that we can use to predict if a city will experience a traffic jam.", "So in a classification task, our goal would be to train a classifier model that can take information from the left(the weather outside, what kind of day it is and the time of the day) and can predict if the city will experience a traffic jam.", "Note: This table seems easy, because we only have a few data points. But in real-world situations, we would have more information and every data point would have many more values. I use this simple table to explain only for the sake of simplicity.", "Coming back to the explanation before, we would feed", "to our model and our model would return to us", "where y1 is the probability that there\u2019s no traffic jam and y2 is the probability that there is a traffic jam. We only need to choose the highest probability and we\u2019re done, we\u2019ve obtained our prediction.", "A more formal way of expressing this is that we need to compute a conditional probability, the probability that Y is y given the fact that X=(x1, x2, \u2026, xm).", "The Bayes theorem tells us how we can compute this conditional probability. Let\u2019s see the equation for that.", "What we know from the probability theory is that if X1 and X2 are independent values(meaning that, for example, the fact that the weather is rainy and that today is a weekend day are totally independent, there\u2019s no conditional relation between them), then we can use this equation.", "Now in our example, this assumption is true. There is absolutely no way that the fact that today is rainy is influenced by the fact that today is Saturday. But generally speaking, this assumption is not true in most of the cases. If we observe a large number of variables for a classification tasks, chances are that at least some of those variables are dependent(for example, education level and monthly income).", "But the Naive Bayes Classifier is called naive just because it works based on this assumption. We consider all observed variables to be independent, because using the equation above helps us simplify the next steps.", "So let\u2019s take a look back at our table to see what happens. Let\u2019s try to see what it is the probability of there being a traffic jam given the fact that the weather is clear, today is a workday and it\u2019s morning time(first line in our table).", "No we only need to expand that so that we can turn this equation into one containing only basic probabilities.", "From here on we can already calculate every probability, like for example:", "You can see that this is already becoming a painful process. You might have doubts because the intuition behind this model looks very simple(although calculating so many probabilities may give you a headache) but it simply works very well and it\u2019s used in so many use cases. Let\u2019s see some of them.", "If you\u2019re like me, all of this theory is almost meaningless unless we see the classifier in action. So let\u2019s see it used on a real-world example. We\u2019ll use a Scikit-Learn implementation in Python and play with a dataset. This was quite a lenghty article, so to make it easier, I\u2019ve split this subject into a mini-series of two articles. For the implementation in Python and Scikit-Learn, please read Naive Bayes Classifier Tutorial in Python and Scikit-Learn.", "This article was originally published on the Programmer Backpack blog.
