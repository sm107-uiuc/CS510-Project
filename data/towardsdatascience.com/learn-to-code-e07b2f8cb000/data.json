Well, now that countries around the world are facing staggering job losses, there is no better time to take action!", "Apple CEO Tim Cook even went so far as to say that learning to code will soon become more important than learning English as a second language.", "Each year, Stack Overflow releases great insight into the profile, career, and life of a developer. Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.", "Last year, nearly 90,000 developers responded to the survey.", "The survey results show you that programming jobs not only have high career-satisfaction, but these careers are actually attainable, even for those without formal training often thought of as required!", "Note: the 2020 results are expected any time now \u2014 it\u2019s my intention to update the article when they are released with current figures.", "Ok, so you\u2019ve heard that coding is an important skill-set to have. Now let\u2019s explore why!", "More and more jobs are being automated and this is changing the job market entirely.

This is in comparison to only 1/2 of general respondents (according to a Conference Board article).", "Let\u2019s take a look at what kind of education professional developers have.", "Based on the Stack Overflow survey, most respondents had at least a Bachelor\u2019s degree. But that shouldn\u2019t scare you off:", "In 2019, over 15% of professional developers didn\u2019t have a college education!", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the data behind that:", "All that to say, don\u2019t let a lack of post-secondary education hold you back. There are a number of great resources available online!", "The important thing is to let your work shine for you! Consider developing a portfolio of your work that showcases your skills. This is especially important when you don\u2019t have the formal education to back this up.", "A portfolio can be hosted on sites like Github.com and should be inserted into your resume.", "Over 2/3 of professional developers have been coding for fewer than 10 years!", "Even getting minimal coding skills to automate some of your work can really help in terms of employability. These types of skills can make you incredibly valuable to current and potential employers. The Guadian even lists coding as a required skill for people to learn.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how long people have been coding for, and how long the pros have been coding professionally:", "According to Stack Overflow, developers of languages like VBA have the most years of experience.", "Developers of languages like Python and PHP have the fewest years of experience.", "Which is great as people you may be competing against have fewer years of experience.", "We\u2019ll soon see that Python is also one of the most loved languages.", "Which language to choose is one of the most common questions. This is a tough one, but worth exploring.", "Stack Overflow asked their respondents what languages they wanted to learn, loved using, and dreaded using. While the survey results aren\u2019t a definitive list to where to start, they can give you a general indication of what might be enjoyable to learn \u2014 and what might not be.", "The chart above shows the most wanted languages by professional developers \u2014 meaning that developers who don\u2019t yet know it, want to use it.", "Let\u2019s explore what languages developers use and continue to love using.", "These languages are a good place to start exploring what might be the best fit for what you want to accomplish!", "Let\u2019s see what Stack Overflow\u2019s hundreds of thousands of respondents had to say:", "While this isn\u2019t meant as a definitive list of what languages to avoid, this might give you a sense of what other languages people struggle with or find tedious to work in.", "(The dreaded figure means that developers are currently using the language, but express no interest in continuing to do so.)", "So, you\u2019re motivated to learn to program? What now?", "Python is a great place to start! Python is easy to pick up, fast to implement and has a great, helpful community behind it. It\u2019s useful and lets you build a large variety of tools \u2014 from automation scripts, to machine learning models, to web applications.", "Take a look around and google the languages in the most loved and most wanted and see what kind of projects resonate with you.", "Your home for data science.
