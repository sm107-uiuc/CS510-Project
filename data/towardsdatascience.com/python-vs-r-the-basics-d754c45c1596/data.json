Both have vast software ecosystems and communities, so either language is suitable for almost any data science task.", "So the question is, which language should an aspiring data scientist learn first? Long story short, the answer is usually Python. However, each language has its own strengths and weaknesses to consider before diving head first.", "Additionally, it\u2019s important to note that Python and R are not the only programming languages or tools that can be used for data science. Some others include Scala, SAS, Julia, MATLAB, and much more.", "Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with an easy-to-learn syntax. It was introduced in 1991. The 2008 revision, Python 3.0, has made many older libraries built on Python 2 not forwards compatible. Most of the data science job can now be done with five main libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn.", "The main advantage of Python is the implantation of machine learning on a large scale. Additionally, it makes makes replicability and accessibility easy. And if you need to use the results of your analysis in an application or website, Python is the best choice.", "R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R was based on S, which was introduced in 1976. Therefore, R can sometimes be considered as outdated. However, new packages are being developed every day, allowing the language to catch up to the more \u201cmodern\u201d Python.", "The cutting-edge difference between R and other statistical products is the output. R has advanced tools to communicate the results. For instance, Rstudio comes with the library ggplot2, a visualization tool that can generate box plots, violin plots, dot plots, strip charts, and much more.", "If you are new to the field, it\u2019s hard to know whether to use Python or R. However, there\u2019s no \u2018right\u2019 programming language for Data Science. One language isn\u2019t better than the other \u2014 it all depends on your use case and the questions you\u2019re trying to answer.", "From Kaggle\u2019s study in 2019, it\u2019s clear that Python is currently the leading programming language for Data Science. SQL, which is a language designed for relational database management, ranks in second. However, it can be limited when it comes to data analysis. So R comes in close third due to the language\u2019s extensive statistical capabilities.", "This chart is far from exhaustive and experts endlessly debate over which is the \u2018superior\u2019 language. But in the end, Python programmers and R programmers often borrow great ideas from each other. For example, Python\u2019s plotnine data visualization package was inspired by R\u2019s ggplot2 package. And R\u2019s rvest web scraping package was inspired by Python\u2019s BeautfiulSoup package.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that there is interoperability between Python and R. You can run R code from Python using the rpy2 package. And you can run Python code from R using reticulate. That means that all features present in one language can be accessed from the other language.", "The \u2018zen of Python\u2019 is that there\u2019s a proper way to write everything. R doesn\u2019t have this set of conventions, so programming can be a less structured and difficult to learn for beginners. Let\u2019s look at four basic examples to see the similarities and differences.", "We already know that we can assign a variable in Python with the \u2018=\u2019 operator.", "In R, we have to use an arrow operator to assign variables.", "Similarly, lists in Python can be assigned to variable, with any data type within the brackets. These lists can be indexed with the element\u2019s index number, starting from 0.", "Lists in R are a little different. They are wrapped in parentheses, and each element is assigned a name. These elements can be indexed with \u2018$name\u2019, but they can also be indexed with the element position. Note that indexing in R starts at 1, instead of the widely conventional 0.", "Python vectors are just arrays of numbers. We can perform arithmetic and additional operations such as scalar multiplication and dot product with NumPy.", "In R, we wrap vectors with \u2018c()\u2019 instead of brackets, and each element can be accessed with indexing. Vectors can be deleted by assigning the \u2018NULL\u2019 to it.", "For Python, we have to import the popular pandas library to access DataFrames. In general, Python heavily relies on libraries to perform specific tasks.", "R has a built-in readr library function, which has the advantage of greater speed and consistent interpretation of data types.", "Those are just basic examples of the different syntax across Python and R. As you dive deeper with working with matrices, dataframes and other data structures, things obviously get a lot more complicated. Especially with R.", "But at surface level, each language\u2019s syntax has a lot of similarities. For instance, both languages use \u2018#\u2019 for commenting. Also, single quotes and double quotes are interchangeable in both languages.", "For beginners, Python is recommended because of the language\u2019s \u201creadable\u201d syntax. It\u2019s also more expressive and concise than R, and even other programming languages.", "Ultimately, Python seems to be the most widely used programming languages for data scientists today. It allows the integration of SQL, TensorFlow, and many other useful functions and libraries for data science and machine learning. With over 70,000 Python libraries, the possibilities are endless.", "With that being said, a data scientist (or programmer in general) should never be limited to one language. It\u2019s possible to combine the two leading software ecosystems in one project to get a uniquely complemented set of functions.", "While both Python and R are great choices for data science, factors like employee background, the projects you work on, and the culture of your industry can guide your preference. I encourage all aspiring data scientists to keep an open mind about both languages. As you learn Python, keep an eye out for instances where R could come in handy.", "Your home for data science.
