More than just a hobby, they\u2019re precious babies that take hours and hours of your time and attention but reward you with a feeling of pride when they grow up. In my second year of studying computer science, I was ready to start a new one. Finding a good side project isn\u2019t easy: it should be something that interests you and allows you to learn new skills. As a fan of Formula 1, I came across a peculiar thought \u2014 could I use statistical data to predict the results of future Formula 1 races? It seemed feasible (statistical models are commonly used in other sports to predict results), useful for learning new skills, and most importantly, fun! While at the time I had no experience in data science, I took up the challenge and decided to start from predicting the results of Formula 1 qualifications.", "In most sports, historical results are fundamentally a time series: future performance of an athlete is more closely correlated to their performance in the past year than 10 years ago. To model the time-series nature of the problem, I decided to base the statistical model on a \u201cpower score\u201d system. The model would consist of power scores which are used in predicting how well a driver performs in the qualification. If they over-perform their expectation their score should increase, and vice versa. This is similar to the Elo rating system used for ranking players in various games such as chess. However, Formula 1 is complex because a driver\u2019s performance can\u2019t be entirely attributed to themselves: the constructor they\u2019re driving for also plays an important role. When developing the model, three separate entities were identified: the driver, the constructor and the engine used by the constructor. The model maintains separate power scores for drivers, engines and constructors, and the prediction is calculated by combining all of them.", "However, this creates another problem: how much weight should each \u201ccomponent\u201d carry when predicting the results? Should the driver\u2019s score be weighted more than the constructor or engine? First, I set the weights by hand according to my domain knowledge. But then I started wondering if there is a smarter way to do things: could the best weights be calculated in some way? In order to calculate the best weights, I would first need to define \u201cbest\u201d. I decided the best weights would be ones that minimise the difference of positions between real and predicted results. In this loss function, not every position difference was equal: differences amongst the top-4 qualifiers mattered more than of the ones at the bottom, because I was most interested in seeing what the order of the top drivers is going to be. With the loss function defined, running the statistical model on the time-series calculated an overall \u201cprediction score\u201d that showed how well the chosen weights predicted the results of qualifications.", "The loss function was then used manually to find the weights that gave the best prediction score. I would first calculate the score for the initial weights, and then try to adjust them individually. When the score improved, I continued adjusting them: when it didn\u2019t, the initial weight was preserved. This was done until a point was reached where changing the weights no longer improved the score: the optimal weights had been found!", "While the weights in the model had been optimised, there was still work for improvement. As mentioned before, the model was generated by reading and transforming historic qualifying results. However, there were several parameters for defining how this transformation works, such as the starting power score of a rookie driver, how much power scores should change between seasons and so on. These can be thought of as the hyper-parameters of the model \u2014 and they again were set as my best guess. I wanted to optimise them as well, but since the hyperparameters directly affect the model weights, optimising both weights by hand would be too complex and time-consuming. Clearly, at least some parts of the process would need to be automated.", "At this point, I started to learn more about machine learning and AI in school. While I had known what machine learning is before, the topic was mystified as some highly complex \u201cmagic\u201d you would at the very least need a PhD to even think about. But as I was learning more about it, I started to recognise the similarities between machine learning principles and my statistical model. Ultimately, a machine learning model is a function which maps sets of inputs and model parameters (weights) to an output. The weights can be determined in any way you want (randomly, set by hand, by asking a crystal ball etc.), but generally they are learned from the training data. My rudimentary method of optimising the model weights by hand had the right approach, and even used a similar method to gradient descent, an algorithm commonly used in training machine learning models. My approach also taught me the importance of selecting the right loss function for training. The learned weights are only optimal in the context of the selected loss function \u2014 if the loss function is invalid, so is the learned solution. In addition, the project highlighted the importance of data cleaning and pre-processing steps, which are often missing from the neat datasets given in AI/ML schoolwork.", "Ultimately, a machine learning model is a function which maps sets of inputs and model parameters (weights) to an output", "The model described above is the one I built for the first version of the project. Since then, significant improvements to the model have been made, most significantly automating the model\u2019s training using gradient descent. The concept of inputs and weights has also been formalised into a proper linear regression model. Even though linear regression is simple, it works quite well for this dataset, especially since it largely avoids the overfitting issues other models struggle with. The model also uses the more conventional MAE as the cost function. The system also allows hyperparameter optimisation, though parts of it are still done manually. Due to the time-series nature of the data, the system also doesn\u2019t yet properly split the data into test and training sets. This is something I\u2019m hoping to fix in the coming months, after which I can take a second look at non-linear models. In any case, the predicted results can be accessed online, though it\u2019s unclear when the 2020 Formula 1 season will properly start due to the coronavirus outbreak.", "Machine learning and data science are highly promising fields of technology, and as such it\u2019s no wonder many students are interested in learning them. This project showed me that the best way to get started may not be following a step-by-step guide or course on making a standard ML model but experimenting on a real project and dataset and discovering the need for ML techniques yourself. After spending hours manually adjusting the weights of my model, I understand the purpose of machine learning better than any textbook could explain. So, if you\u2019re starting out your journey in data science and ML, always ask yourself why each step in the workflow is used and what would happen if you didn\u2019t have it. This way you\u2019ll learn not only what to do, but also why it\u2019s done!", "Your home for data science.
