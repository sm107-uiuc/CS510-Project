It takes us a while to learn how to create more than one graph within a figure and then we realize that we can do more, much more.", "I highly recommend that you read my article \u201cThe ultimate guide to Data Visualization\u201d if you are starting now with data visualization. There I teach how to create different plot types and how to customize your figures!", "We will cover some essential aspects of Matplotlib\u2019s figures, such as:", "And much more! At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to understand what you are doing with your figures! Let\u2019s start?", "Everyone is used to a standard Matplotlib figure, where you can put just one plot; this is no longer a mystery to anyone else, correct?", "First, you always start by creating your figure; Then, you select the plot type and begin to adjust the information and styles. Useful technique.", "The problem starts when you need to create several charts together; It doesn\u2019t make sense to create unique figures hoping they look great, so what do you do?", "Matplotlib has a great tool for working with multiple plots, called gridspec; With that, you can insert more than one graph in a single figure. Let\u2019s take a look at the code.", "First, I\u2019ve started the GridSpec with a single row and three columns. Since there is more than one column, it was also necessary to pass the parameter width_ratios, which expects a list of integers that will be the width of each column. Want an easier option? So I will recommend subplot2grid.", "The right choice for anyone! It is not difficult to use, facilitating the whole process. Let\u2019s take a look at what we can do first.", "The subplot2grid uses GridSpec under the hood; That is why it works so well. The difference between both is that the GridSpec creates a new subplot and passes the positions as an argument; Subplot2grid does it all together, so you instantiate it with the configuration. Which one is the best? Both? Which one do you need to know? GridSpec.", "If you\u2019re looking for an even easier way to plot multiple graphs and don\u2019t want to overcomplicate with different widths, try subplot. Let\u2019s look at an example.", "Generally used during Exploratory Data Analysis, due to the ease in plotting various graphs. We place our plot code inside a loop that will be in charge of attaching every graph in its place.", "Now you know how to improve your data visualization, so let\u2019s dive into the importance of labels.", "All your figures must have a title, labels on the x and y axes, and a legend explaining the differences in your data. This is always necessary, without exception.", "The amount of information can be reduced inside a team, as everyone is already aware of the problems they are trying to solve. Yet some way is still needed to specify these plots.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how I added all of these labels in the figure above.", "There is some essential information that you can not forget, let\u2019s check:", "Always think about your graph as a piece of art; You need to create always thinking about who will see it and how they will react.", "For us, the less time we take to explain something, the more we have to sell our ideas.", "I hope you enjoyed this content and can apply your new knowledge with mastery!
