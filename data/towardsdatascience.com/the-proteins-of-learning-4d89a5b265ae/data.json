The current article is about a success story on how to use TDA to better understand protein expression and the effect of drugs on proteins expressions.", "This analysis has been applied to real data, real diseases and real drugs. The Memantine compound is being currently used in curing Alzheimer disease: are we really understanding how this drug affects our body?", "The rest of this article presents a detailed analysis on how to use TDA (in particular, persistent homology and the Mapper algorithm) to cluster the data without loosing its high dimensional shape and how it is possible to extract novel insights from such data. In particular, as it will be shown below, an unsupervised analysis of the dataset turns out to be essential in order to extract meaningful genomic characteristics: the individuality of test subject is far too great to be able to extract stable and generalisable results with a naive analysis.", "If you are new to TDA, I recommend you read the following blogpost as an introduction on getting started with giotto-tda [3]. This one is also useful to better understand the Mapper algorithm used below.", "This article has been written in collaboration with Mara Sabina Bernardi. The Jupyter notebook used to perform this analysis can be found here.", "Many diseases can affect our ability to learn: two amongst the most infamous examples are the Alzheimer disease and the Down syndrome. The Down Syndrome is characterised by a trisomy of chromosome 21, thus augmenting the expression of those proteins coded by such chromosome.", "Unfortunately, the excess of the synthesis of certain proteins can have dreadful consequences on the functioning of the human body. In particular, the excess of certain neurotransmitters, i.e. proteins whose purpose is to pass messages amongst neurons, may saturate the communication channels between the neurons themselves, preventing a proper propagation of the information through the brain. The phenotypical consequence is the loss of mental abilities (such as the possibility to learn and memorise) as well as physical clumsiness and poor coordination.", "Recent advances in the pharmaceutical technologies have allowed for the the development of new drugs to treat such diseases, for example by inhibiting the expression of certain proteins: Memantine is one example. Unfortunately, it is not yet known what is the effect on gene expression on humans of this drug.", "The purpose of this post is to present an analysis pipeline that uses TDA to better understand protein expressions in learning tasks. Furthermore, we will also show which are the proteins whose expression is modified by the use of Memantine.", "The analysis has been implemented using the library giotto-tda [3].", "The dataset is described in C. Higuera et al. [1].", "The following analysis has been inspired by the work of C. Higuera et al. [1].", "The dataset used consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There were 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice, for a total of 72 mice. Measurements were made using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), a high throughput technique in which protein samples from individual mice are robotically spotted onto nitrocellulose-coated microscope slides.", "There are eight different classes of mice: four classes are composed of normal mice (i.e. control mice, as they are used for reference), while the other four classes are composed of Down-syndromic mice. Part of the control mice and down mice are stimulated to learn a specific task; some are injected with Memantine, some others not.", "The combination of control mice VS Down mice, stimulated to learn VS not stimulated to learn and injected with Memantine VS not injected with Memantine constitute the eight classes.", "The aim of the analysis is to identify those proteins that are discriminant for the different classes.", "The analysis is structured in the following five steps:", "This step is standard and it consists of cleaning up the data and normalise it. We can also try to visualise the dataset by using a 3D PCA: unfortunately, the complexity of the dataset does not allow for a clear understanding of the feature space: indeed, the shape of the dataset (which will be analysed in the next section) is distorted by this representation. Therefore, a more refined analysis is required: in particular, we chose to use the persistent homology to better understand the shape of the dataset.", "In this exploratory phase, we use persistent homology to get an idea of what is the global shape of the dataset.", "This diagram shows us, abstractly, what the shape of our point cloud looks like. In particular, when looking at the H0 component (i.e. the red points), we see (top left) that there are eight points that are separated from the others. These are reasonably separated connected components. On the other hand, there are no relevant 1-loops in the dataset, as demonstrated by the H1 component (i.e. the noisy green points, close to the diagonal of the diagram).", "We use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to differentiate the protein distribution amongst the different classes. This technique will highlight how protein expression varies amongst the different classes. Unfortunately, due to the individuality of each mouse, the results are too noisy to reach meaningful conclusions. Hence, we need to refine the analysis with an unsupervised technique.", "We apply the Mapper algorithm and try to relate its shape with a finer decomposition of the classes. The purpose would be to refine the classes and study the difference in protein expressions not amongst single individuals but rather amongst regions of the mapper graph. This will remove noise due to individuality and allow us to better identify the critical proteins. We apply again the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to quantify the significance of protein expressions amongst different regions of the Mapper graph.", "How do we interpret the Mapper graph? Each node is a small cluster of points. An edge exists if the two connected nodes have some data points in common. The colour of a node is an average of the labels. The association of colours with the classes, relevant for the final analysis, is the following:", "Let us point out that there is no use of this \u201caverage\u201d except to help the visual intuition to understand how classes changes over the graph! Nodes with just one colour are called pure and they will be considered for the final Wilcoxon test. As a filter function, we used the 3D output of the UMAP algorithm, another very powerful topological tool used for dimensionality reduction.", "The clusters found by the mapper algorithm, clearly show that there are many similar groups of mice within a class. Thus, we proceed with a comparison of proteins expressions between such clusters, hoping to remove individuality from the game.", "We benchmark the results of step 4 of the analysis with a more standard clustering algorithm: DBScan().", "In the next figure, we see how the dataset is far too noisy to be properly described by the clustering algorithm, as the number of clusters is heavily influenced by the nearest neighbours parameter \ud835\udf16 without a clear indication of what would be the correct number of clusters to consider.", "We benchmark with the KMeans() clustering algorithm to see if we can find a reasonable number of clusters via the elbow method.", "As we can see in the next figure, there is no clear elbow: hence, also in this case, we cannot decide on the optimal number of clusters.", "To find the relevant proteins, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is applied to the Mapper pure clusters only. Wilcoxon test compares two distributions: hence, the questions that can be answered by this statistical test are about comparisons between the distributions of the protein expressions of two chosen classes. For a chosen class, each Mapper pure cluster is thus compared with all the pure clusters of the other chosen class. The comparison is done via the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and it analyses protein expressions one at a time. The proteins that pass the test are tho ones selected. To make results robust, only the proteins that are selected by the Wilcoxon test in all the comparisons among pure clusters are taken into account.", "While most of the proteins expressions that we identified are present in both the current analysis and in the work of C. Higuera et al. [1], there are some relevant differences concerning the Memantine effect on protein expressions. Thus, the topological methods are indicating that some features related to the shape of the overall point cloud are to be taken into account when performing protein expression analysis. Experts could give further interpretations to these results.", "For a detailed list of the proteins names, please refer to the analysis notebook or the original paper [1].", "The individuality of each mouse affects protein expression. Such individuality is far too great to have meaningful and interpretable results using standard statistical approach as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Grouping together individuals with similar genetic characteristics in an unsupervised way is necessary to obtain meaningful results. Thus, we need to cluster mice together to better understand how protein expression affect a sub-cluster.", "The use of the Mapper algorithm allowed for a more accurate identification of the most relevant proteins taking part in the learning tasks. Furthermore, thanks to this powerful technique \u2014 which does not require at all a pre-defined number of clusters \u2014 it was possible to characterise which proteins expressions are affected by the Memantine compound. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test applied to portions of the Mapper graph enhanced the results significantly and allowed for a precise identification of the relevant proteins.", "The use of more standard clustering approaches such as DBScan\u2014 which does not require to set a-priori the number of expected clusters \u2014 or KMeans has clear limitations in terms of better understanding which groups to consider together. This can be clearly seen by the instability of the number of clusters even with small variations of the nearest neighbours parameter for DBScan or the absence of elbows for KMeans.", "[3] G.
