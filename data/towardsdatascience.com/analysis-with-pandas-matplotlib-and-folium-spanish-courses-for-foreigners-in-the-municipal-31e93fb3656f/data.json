Currently, more and more European cities provide an open data portal, allowing companies, citizens, researchers, and other public institutions to make use of the data.", "In this article, we employ the data set that contains information about students who attend Spanish courses for foreigners in the Municipal Office during the first semester of 2018. This data set includes information about the students such as the level of the course they attend, the sex, the age, the nationality, the level of education and the administrative status.", "The data set (2018-1er semestre) can be downloaded at the following link:", "datos.madrid.es provides data sets in Spanish. Therefore, before starting with the exploratory data analysis, we have to translate the data set into English. The following article explains how we can easily translate the data set by using Googletrans library.", "Once the data frame is translated, we are ready to start the exploratory data analysis. \ud83d\udc4c", "Exploratory data analysis consists of analyzing the main characteristics of a data set usually by means of visualization methods and summary statistics. The objective is to understand the data, discover patterns and anomalies, and check assumption before we perform further evaluations.", "We load the translated file into a Pandas data frame by using the pandas.read_csv function and visualize the first 5 rows with the pandas.DataFrame.head method.", "Inappropriate data types and missing values are the most common problems of data sets. We can easily analyze both by using the pandas.DataFrame.info method. This method prints information about a DataFrame including column types, number of non-null values, and memory usage.", "The data set does not contain null values and the data types are the expected ones. As we can observe, the column age has a data type string. This data type is correct, since age is given in ranges.", "As we can observe, column names have spaces and upper case letter. We modify these names, replacing spaces by underscores and upper case letters by lower case letters with the pandas.DataFrame.rename method. Now, it is possible to access columns, using not only square brackets but also dot notation.", "We observe unique elements in each column to discover inconsistent and repeated entries.", "As shown above, the column sex has two denominations for the same element (man and Man). Furthermore, after translating the data frame with googletrans, some entries start with upper case letters (e.g. High school, Primary, or Employee), while others with lower case letters (e.g. academic, uneducated, or student).", "We can solve both problems at once by converting the first letter of each entry into an upper case letter as follows:", "Now, each entry in the data frame starts with an upper case letter. We did this modification because we do not want that future visualizations contain labels starting with both upper case and lower case letters. Moreover, we want to replace man by Man, so that the data frame contains only two unique values in the column sex: Man and Woman.", "We can observe that the column age contains the entry 65. It would be interesting to clarify if this refers to students of 65 years old, or more than 65 years old (for me make more sense, since ages are given in ranges).", "Data cleaning finished!! \ud83d\ude0d Now, are ready to answer questions and draw conclusions using our data.", "Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning are the steps that allow us to get a feeling about the data set and to get the data set ready to easily draw conclusions using it. Now! We are ready to answer the following questions using the dataset.", "We have to count the number of rows to obtain the number of students, since each row in the data frame contains information about one student. This can be easily achieved with the pandas.DataFrame.shape attribute as follows:", "During the first semester of 2018, 2274 students attended Spanish courses for foreigners in the Municipal Office in Madrid.", "To obtain the percentage of females, we can employ the pandas.Series.value_counts function. This function returns a Series containing counts of unique values. If we want to obtain frequencies instead of counts, we use the argument normalize=True.", "As we can observe, the percentage of women is larger than the percentage of men. We can also visualize the results by using a bar plot in the following manner:", "To obtain the number of students enrolled at each level, we are going to use the pandas.Series.value_counts function as before, but this time, we sort alphabetically the indexes of the returned Series with the pandas.Series.sort_index function, since the alphabetical order matches an increasing level of difficulty (A1 is easier than A2).", "Special courses such as A2 DELE (exam for obtaining Spanish nationality), B1 conversation, and Literacy (learning to read and write) have fewer students than regular courses (A1,A2, and B1). However, the advanced level course (B2) has fewer participants than other regular courses.", "To analyze the number of students by level and gender, we use the function pandas.DataFrame.groupby. This function involves some combination of splitting the object, applying a function, and combining the results. We can group by according to two features providing their names in a list as follows:", "We obtain a multi index data frame, since grouping by two columns will give you two indices. The goal is to employ this data frame that contains number of students by level and gender and create a side-by-side bar chart with the function pandas.DataFrame.plot, but first we have to perform some modifications.", "We select one column (e.g. age) as all the columns provide the same information (count). Then, we use the pandas.DataFrame.unstack function. This function pivots a level of the (necessarily hierarchical) index labels, returning a DataFrame having a new level of column labels whose innermost level consists of the pivoted index labels.", "Now, we can easily create a side-by-side bar chart with the plot function. Each column is assigned a distinct color, and each row is nested in a group along the horizontal axis.", "As we can observe, more women are enrolled in regular courses (A1, A2, and B1). However, the number of men in A2 DELE and Literacy courses is higher.", "To analyze the number of students by level and geographical area, we create as before a side-by-side bar chart.", "In courses A1, A2, B1, B1 conversation, and B2, most of the students are Asiatic. On the contrary, A2 DELE and Literacy courses have more students from Magreb and Sub-Saharan Africa.", "We create a bar plot to visualize the number of students according to the administrative status. In this case, we employ a horizontal bar chart, indicating the number of students additionally with labels.", "As shown above, most of the students are in an irregular administrative situation (763). A little more than 500 students have residence and work permit (ART: autorizaci\u00f3n de residencia y trabajo); and 266 students have residence permit (A R: autorizaci\u00f3n de residencia). The number of students in asylum amounts to 91.", "If we want labels indicating the percentage instead of the number of students, we modify the plot in the following manner:", "The method pandas.Series.round rounds each value in a Series to the given number of decimals (by default 0). In this case, we provide a label, rounded to two decimal places, representing the percentage of students in each administrative status. As shown above, these labels are in bold. We can easily achieve that by including the argument weight=bold in the matplotlib.pyplot.text function.", "So far, we have only used bar plots to obtain conclusions, but there are other type of visualizations, we can employ. One of these alternatives is pie plots. A pie chart is a circular graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. In this chart, the arc length of the slice is proportional to the quantity that it represents (as the height in a bar chart).", "We can create a pie chart by using the pandas.DataFrame.plot function, providing the argument kind=\u2019pie\u2019 in the following manner:", "The autopct=\u2019%1.1f%%\u2019 parameter displays the percentage value using Python string formatting. Another parameter that we have used is colors. This parameter determines the sequence of matplotlib color args through which the pie chart will cycle. In this case, the colormap selected is Pastel2.", "As we can observe, both bar plots and pie plots can convey the same information. However, bar charts are a better option forvisualization, since comparing objects along one dimension (height) is easier than along two (area).", "Now! It\u2019s time to continue answering questions using the data. As shown above, 33.6% of the students are in an irregular administrative situation, while only 4% are in asylum. Let\u2019s try to obtain more information about those two groups!", "To evaluate both groups, we have to filter the data frame based on the values of the column administrative_status. We create two data frames, containing information about: (1) students in an irregular situation, (2) students in asylum.", "We use the pandas.Series.unique method to check whether the filtering has been conducted properly.", "We did it right \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udc9a! Df_irregular contains information only about students in an irregular administrative status, and df_asylum about students in asylum.", "First, we analyze the nationality of irregular students, and students in asylum.", "As shown above, most Asiatic students in an irregular situation are women; however, most Sub-Saharan African students are men. There are not students neither in irregular nor in asylum situation from North America and European Union. In addition, the students in asylum from Europe outside the EU, and Magreb are only men.", "Regarding levels, most students in irregular situation are enrolled in low level courses A1, and A2 (58,72%) in contrast to students in asylum, which are to a lesser extent (38,46%) enrolled in A1, and A2 levels. The percentage of students attending literacy course is almost equal (around 10%).", "To obtain the ages of the students, we can employ the pandas.Series.value_counts function as before, but in addition it is necessary to reindex the data frame before plotting, since indexes are not in increasing age order. This can be achieved with the pandas.Series.reindex method, passing a list with the new labels (indexes) as an argument.", "As can be seen, more than 90% of students are between 18 and 50 years old. It is unclear if 65 refers to students over 65 years old ( it would make sense, since ages are provided in ranges) or exactly 65 years old.", "According to levels, A2 DELE course (exam for obtaining Spanish nationality) is mainly attended by students in the range 31 to 50 years old. In other levels (except A1), the percentages of student in the ranges 18 to 30 years old and 31 to 50 years old are pretty similar (see figure below).", "And Now! our last question \ud83c\udf40", "To answer this question, we are not going to use bar plots as before, but another interesting visualization tool: cloropleth maps.", "A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded according to the statistical variable being displayed on the map (e.g. number of students). This visualization is really useful to represent the variability of a measurement across a region by using a sequential color scheme (the higher the measurement the stronger the color).", "To create a choropleth map, Folium requires a Geo JSON file, including geospatial data of the region. For a choropleth map of the world, we would need a Geo JSON file that defines the boundaries of all world countries. You can download this file in the following link:", "After moving the file to the current directory, we can read the json object with the json.load() method from the json library as follows:", "As shown above, the json.load() method returns a python dictionary named data. We use the built-in module pprint to print the dictionary data in a more readable way. As we can observe, the file world-countries.json provides polygons, defining world\u2019s countries boundaries.", "We are reading and visualizing world-countries.json file to get a feeling of how the data is structured. However, when creating a cloropleth map with Folium, we only have to provide the path to the GeoJSON file, meaning it is not necessary to read the file with json module, as we did above.", "Now! we are ready to use Folium! \ud83d\udcaa \ud83c\udf0e", "Folium is a python library that enables iterative visualizations on leaflet maps. Before generating the cloropleth map, we have to create a data frame, containing the number of students from each country as follows:", "Additionally, to bind the data frame and the json file successfully, the name of the country in the data frame must match exactly the name of the country in the json file. Therefore, we have to analyze which names in the data frame are not contained in the json file and modify them accordingly.", "As shown above, the following names are not available in the json file: (1) Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, (2) Syrian Arab Republic,(3) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland of the North, (4) Sahara, (5) Republic of Moldova, (6) Cape Verde, (7) Palestine, (8) Singapore, and (9) Malta. Now, we modify the data frame, replacing these names by those available in the json file.", "Regarding previous modification, following aspects must be taken into account:", "Now! We are ready to create the cloropleth map! \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude04", "First, we create a Folium Map object, centered around [0,0] (the location argument allows to center the map in a specific location). We also provide an initial zoom level of 2 to zoom the map into the center. Then, we display a cloropleth map by using the .cloropleth() method. This function binds data contained in a Pandas data frame and GeoJSON geometries.", "To generate the map, the following parameters will be used:", "As we can observe, the legend displays a negative boundary (-3). This problem can be fixed by defining our own boundary with the numpy.linspace() function as follows:", "Students are mainly from the Philippines and Morocco, which makes sense, since both were colonies of Spain, where currently Spanish is not an official language of the country. As we can also observe, there is a significant number of students from China, Nepal, and Brasil. In addition, there are no student from Australia, Nordic Countries, and most Latin American nations.", "We cannot properly visualize the number of students by using a bar plot, since there are students from 74 different nations. However, we can display the top ten countries as follows:", "And to finish, we are going to plot a cloropleth map of Europe \ud83c\udf10", "First, we create a data frame, containing the number of students from each European country in the following manner:", "Then, we analyze which names in the data frame are not contained in the europe.geojson file and modify them accordingly.", "We can download the europe.geojson file in the following link:", "Finally, we create a Folium Map object, centered around [53.0,9.0], displaying a cloropleth map with the .cloropleth() method as we did previously.", "As we can observe, students are mainly from Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Georgia, and Bulgaria.", "It will be also interesting to plot cloropleth maps according to gender or course level. As you can see, the analysis can be endless! I encourage you to generate more plots, and try to extract more conclusions by using this open data! But now some recommendations :)", "If you want to learn how to create interesting visualizations with Python, do this course!
