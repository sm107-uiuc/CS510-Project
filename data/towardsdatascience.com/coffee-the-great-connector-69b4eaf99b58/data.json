The smell of coffee and bread, the warmth, the colors, the data! People come and go and come back again to buy various combinations of coffee, bread, pastries and more. Can we use that transaction data in order to find patterns and get insights about what items are more central in our bakery diets?", "I used a dataset with transactions from a bakery and some graph theory in order to visualize the items that are bought frequently together and see if I can extract any insights.", "I used data from a dataset called \u2018Transactions from a Bakery\u2019 that, for reasons I don\u2019t know, is no longer available in Kaggle. The datasets contains data from every transaction from a bakery in Scotland in the time period from October 30th, 2016 up to April 9th, 2017. In total, there are 9,531transactions of 94 unique items.", "Each transaction can include multiple items. My approach was to create a mathematical graph based on all the transactions in the dataset. If a transaction included e.g., bread and coffee I added one connection (i.e., edge) between the node for bread and the node for coffee. If bread and coffee appear together in more than one transaction I increased the weight of the bread \u2014 coffee edge by one for each such transaction. If a transaction includes 3 items, then I added one edge for each (unordered) pair of items.", "In the end of the above process I am left with an undirected, weighted graph where the nodes represent all the unique items observed in the dataset. The edge between node x and node y represents how many times items x and y appear on the same transaction. Note that the graph also includes self edges for items that appear in transactions by themselves. Finally, intuitively, the higher the weight of an edge between two nodes the \u201ccloser\u201d these two items are. I capture that by also assigning a distance for each edge to be the inverse of the edge\u2019s weight. Hence, the more transactions two items appear in together, the larger the weight of that edge and the smaller the distance between those two nodes.", "So if bread and coffee appear together in 10 transactions, the weight of the bread \u2014 coffee edge will be 10 and its distance will be 0.1.", "Using some basic notions from graph theory, my goal was to uncover items that are central in that graph structure, with the hopes that centrality can tell us something meaningful about how customers purchase those items.", "I used the python package networkx, my favorite choice when it comes to creating and analyzing graphs in python. You can the find jupyter notebook with all the code used here.", "Like I mentioned above, I went through every transaction and added an undirected edge for every couple of items that appeared in that transaction. Transactions with only one item added a self-edge for that item in the graph. The resulting graph had 94 nodes (equal to the number of unique items appearing in the dataset) and 1104 weighted edges (including self-edges). Here are some interesting tidbits.", "What other datasets can this graph-theoretic approach be applied on and what can it tell us?", "You can find the jupyter notebook with all the code and the dataset here.", "Your home for data science.
