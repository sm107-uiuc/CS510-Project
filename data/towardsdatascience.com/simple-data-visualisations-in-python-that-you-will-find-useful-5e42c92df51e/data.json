Visualising data helps us digest information easily and extract insights that are otherwise hard to extract. In this post, we will look at 5 types of plots with Seaborn and Matplotlib and their example applications for a data science project.", "In September 2020, Seaborn had a major release: v0.11.0. We will use some of the new features and enhancements from this release in this post. Particularly, you will find that column names for the example dataset and functionality of distribution plots in sections 3 and 4 are different if you are on an earlier version. Therefore, make sure your Seaborn version is updated. You can find detailed information about the release from here.", "Let\u2019s import packages and update default settings for charts to save time from tweaking individual plots and to add a little bit of personal style to the charts:", "If you want to learn more about tweaking chart default settings, you may find this post useful. We will use Seaborn\u2019s built-in dataset on penguins:", "Let\u2019s start with one of my favourite plots that has many applications. Simply put, heatmap is a colour coded table. Heatmap can be used to inspect missing values. It helps to see the magnitude of and patterns in missing data.", "Missing values are shown as white strips in this plot. We can instantly see that gender has more missing values. The connected horizontal white lines across columns (at the top and bottom of the figure) show us the pattern that records with missing values in a numerical column also have missing values in the other numerical columns and gender.", "Heatmap is also useful when inspecting the relationship between variables. For instance, correlation matrix to inspect linear relationships between numeric variables can be visualised as follows:", "From this plot, we can see that flipper_length_mm has a strong positive correlation with body_mass_g (r=0.87).", "Predictive Power Score matrix is another technique for inspecting the strength of any type of relationship. Let\u2019s visualise predictive power score matrix:", "You can learn more about the Predictive Power Score from here.", "When working with a supervised classification model, looking at confusion matrix helps to assess model performance. It\u2019s worth putting in a little extra effort to label and format it properly to make it easier to interpret. Now, let\u2019s build a simple model to predict species. We will treat species as the target for the rest of this post except for the second half of the next section on bar plots. Here\u2019s an example:", "As you have seen from the examples, heatmaps are extremely useful and practical. These are some of my favourite ways to use heatmaps during exploratory analysis or modelling stages. If you ever need to visualise a table (e.g. pivot table or cross tabulation) and make it easier to read, heatmap is your friend.", "Most people are familiar with bar plots. In bar plots, one axis tells us the categories while the other tells us the numerical value associated with that category. Therefore, it\u2019s useful for visualising categorical variables. When working with certain types of machine learning algorithms, looking at feature importance of the model gives us insights on what features the model deems more important. Let\u2019s use it to see feature importance of the simple random forest model that we have built in the previous section:", "If there are many features and/or the name of the features are lengthy, using this format leads to overlapping feature names in the x axis making the plot hard to read. One simple solution is to swap the x and y axis mappings:", "In our next example, we will use two bar plots to get different insights for each categorical variable. The first bar plot will show the frequency of categories. This is helpful to see the overall distribution of the variable, including if there are any dominant or rare categories. For this, we will use sns.countplot() which is a categorical equivalent of histograms. The second bar plot will show the average value of target by each category in a variable. This is helpful to inspect if certain categories is more or less likely to associate with a particular class in the target variable. To illustrate, we will add a random binary target, treat species as a feature and plot the two bar plots for each categorical variable using a for loop:", "Visualising categorical columns this way is really useful when first looking at the data during exploratory analysis and trying to gauge which variables are potentially more useful for a model. The charts on the right will also work if you have a numerical target.", "Histograms and kernel density plots are great ways to check out the distribution of numerical columns. Histograms divide numerical data into bins and show the frequency count for each bin. Histograms can be considered as a special type of bar plot. Density plots on the other hand uses a kernel density estimate to show density. We will use for loop again to plot histogram and density plot of each numerical variable:", "We used hue parameter to map the categories of species to see if a variable\u2019s distribution differs between species of penguins. Because the number of records for each species vary, which can already be seen from the histogram, we made sure that each species had its own normalised kernel density by specifiying common_norm=False in sns.kdeplot(). Here\u2019s an example of what I mean:", "The area under the curve is proportional to the frequency of species in the first plot because common_norm=True normalises density among everyone. On the other hand, the plot on the right normalises within the species, so the area under the curve is equal across species (notice the difference in y axis limit).", "Another simple plot is scatterplot which is useful for looking at the relationship between two numerical variables.", "Generally speaking, histograms refer to univariate histograms where univariate is just a fancy way of saying one (uni) variable (variate). In this section, we will look at bivariate histograms to inspect relationship between two numerical variables.", "Let\u2019s plot both of them for all combinations of numerical column pairs. Of note, legends in these plots were deliberately excluded as the colour coding of the species is identical as before and would have blocked some data points:", "On the left, we are looking at bivariate histograms colour coded by species. On the right, we are looking at scatter plot colour coded by species. We also mapped gender to the size of the points in the scatter plot.", "Unlike in the previous section, these two plots show very similar insights. This means that you can pick your favourite one instead of using both.", "There is a nice functionality in Seaborn for making a similar plot that we looked at in sections 3 and 4 with just a single line of code:", "Using sns.pairplot() is awesome, however, I do find that when the number of variables increase, each plot starts to become really small which makes it difficult to inspect. Hence, it\u2019s best to use it for datasets with small number of columns.", "Would you like to access more content like this? Medium members get unlimited access to any articles on Medium.
