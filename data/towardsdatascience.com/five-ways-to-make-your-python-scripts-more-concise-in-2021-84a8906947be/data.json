Python scripting is especially important when it comes to cleaning data, manipulating data, and feature engineering, so don\u2019t take this lightly \u2014 time is money.", "Although it is reasonably easy to pick up Python and learn the basics, getting better and more efficient at programming in Python is a constant learning curve. Luckily, there are several ways that you can improve and speed up your Python code, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll explore in this article.", "With that said, here are five ways to improve your Python code:", "One of the greatest advantages of Python as a programming language is that it has a huge community of developers who create libraries and packages that can be imported into your development environment. Pre-made libraries and packages can provide you with hundreds of new functions which can save you many hours of work. For example, if you\u2019re not already using NumPy for mathematical calculations and data science, it\u2019s a good idea to import it and learn the basic functions.", "Python also has a number of built-in functions that are also meant to save you time. Just as an example, here is how the map() function can save you tons of time when you are applying a function to iterables in a Python list.", "Functions like these make it so much easier to perform these kinds of operations with much more flexibility and less code!", "Lists in Python are typically created by declaring the variables one by one, appending and removing entries, etc. However, there is a less commonly used way of creating lists that saves you a few coding seconds every time you use it, with the additional benefit that you\u2019ll make a tiny decrease in computing time. It\u2019s called list comprehensions, and they allow you to declare a list with appropriate variables, all in one line, without using a for loop.", "It is so extremely straightforward that the only explanation needed is a before vs after.", "Yes, I know that feels like cheating, but you really can just put your simple loops inside the list declaration and call it a day. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it and it\u2019ll generate exactly the same list, just without the extra lines of code.", "Did you know that there is an easy and intuitive way to simplify your if \u2014 else statements in Python? Normally these sections take up a handful of lines and waste typing time which could be better spent working on important parts of your code. The way you shorten simple if \u2014 else conditions into single line pieces of code is through ternary conditionals.", "Let\u2019s see how it works. Here is our if \u2014 else statement initially:", "However, this code isn\u2019t good and it isn\u2019t concise! We can write it more simply like the following:", "That line will work in practically every modern version of Python. I believe ternary conditionals were first added into Python in version 2.5.", "Have you ever created some kind of dialogue to be printed out on your Python console and wanted to include a variety of variables in it? Well, such a simple task can get fairly tricky and time-consuming if you have a lot of variables, but there\u2019s a faster and more efficient way to perform this task.", "The method is through using Python F-strings. There are actually three types of F-strings available in Python, and they all work to help format your strings with variables. It saves you having to convert each variable to the right type before your print statement, and it allows you to more intuitively write the text inside print(). It\u2019s easier to understand how this works by looking at the code.", "Here is what your print statement might look like with several variables and a print statement when you are not using F-strings:", "That code is ugly, takes long to write and all in all not very convenient for anyone. I understand that many people have been using this method for years, and beginners especially are the most common users of this conventional technique. However, look how better it is with F-strings:", "Not only was this F-string about three times faster for me to type out, but it is also far more intuitive, makes more sense at a glance, and allows faster and more convenient editing. There are various more benefits of F-strings that you should explore yourself.", "What are lambda functions, you ask? Not many beginner programmers looking to clean up their code and become more efficient in Python actually discover lambda functions, and they\u2019re missing out. A lambda is effectively a tiny function, a little unit, which has a single output and can be run again and again with very minimal lines of code.", "As usual, let\u2019s see our before vs after for how a lambda can improve your code:", "Notice how when we used lambda, we didn\u2019t have to define the fahrenheit(T) or the celsius(T) functions.", "The lambda acts kind of like a variable, but don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a function. You can save yourself a few lines of code with this, and it is recommendable to use lambda functions for those little operations you find yourself repeating over and over again in your program!", "I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did writing this! Hopefully, you learned a couple of things, like new data visualization techniques or what makes a good visualization. Let me know what your favorite data visualization from 2020 is in the comments.", "Your home for data science.
