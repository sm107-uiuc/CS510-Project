It will require 2 to 5 hours of your time.\u201d", "No one likes take-home assignments. But companies do need to evaluate candidates. These are my recommendations to improve the process, having given and received take-home challenges.", "5 hours from an experienced candidate is worth several hundred dollars. While a company reviewing an assignment for 5 minutes costs very little.", "Not every tech company can afford to compensate all interviewees. But they can offer \u201csomething\u201d in return.", "The power difference between candidate and company means the company ultimately decides on the hiring process.", "That said, a small token of gratitude to un-hired candidates can go a long way to building goodwill\u2014 I\u2019d tell my friends if a company offered me a gift card!", "Working on product with other engineers takes more than just code.", "Written communication, presentation skills, and business-sense are also important, but aren\u2019t well-tested by take-home assignments.", "Though generally, a take-home assignment IS a good test of end-to-end engineering skills. Aka. Can the candidate work with all levels of the stack in order to solve a problem.", "In data science, this could be imagining, training and deploying a model. In software engineering, it could be designing, building and deploying an application.", "This is something that verbal interviews and algorithm questions can\u2019t evaluate. Take-home assignments give a more wholistic picture of a candidates ability. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the best option.", "My gut reaction when receiving an assignment is to ignore it, and apply to other companies instead.", "And in such cases, assignments successfully weed out candidates who haphazardly applied. Which is a good thing \u2014companies want to hire candidates who want to work there.", "But on the flip side, candidates desperate for a job, and candidates who just enjoy coding challenges may complete it anyway.", "My advice is this. Never give an assignment to someone you wouldn\u2019t consider hiring. Don\u2019t waste people\u2019s time.", "You can\u2019t hire someone without evaluating technical skills. Period.", "Having interviewed 100+ candidates, I can tell you that over-inflated resumes are the norm.", "Coding skills need to be evaluated whether the candidate has a master in CS or worked at Google.", "And take-home assignments, despite the downsides are a great way to test this, above and beyond what algorithm questions evaluate.", "Given the end-to-end nature of take-home assignments, they\u2019re especially relevant to startups that need to hire generalist developers.", "The only thing coders hate more than take-home assignments is white boarding.", "White boarding is an even bigger time commitment than an assignment. Given you take time off work, go to their office, and stand in-front of a white board for 3 hours. All while being watched by multiple other developers.", "Aside from the time commitment, white boarding is terrible for introverts, who may be super talented engineers but can\u2019t function while a group of people watches them.", "For this reason, assignments may be a fairer way to evaluate some candidates.", "Pay candidates to do real work.", "Assuming they\u2019ve passed other interview stages, have them contribute to your company as an engineer or data scientist.", "Invite them to a product meeting, give them real tickets, and have them write code that needs to make it through the review process and be deployed.", "This not only tests coding specific to the company\u2019s domain, but allows everyone in the company to evaluate them. The work can be done on-premise or remotely.", "Finding such projects, and doing this at scale is difficult, but not impossible. And there\u2019s no better way to evaluate candidates.", "There are problems in the hiring process. Neither candidates or employers would disagree.", "A lack of experimentation, and doing what\u2019s always been done is keeping it broken.", "We need a system where both candidates and employers invest in the process. This way we can create a hiring environment that\u2019s beneficial to everyone.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Just a developer.
