All codes that are shown here are uploaded on GitHub. Enjoy!", "A few months ago, in February 2020, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched an ambitious mission to explore the Sun and its violent environment: The Solar Orbiter, short: SolO. The 1.8 ton spacecraft is equipped with 10 instruments to investigate miscellaneous properties of the Sun, like the Sun\u2019s Corona or the Solar Wind. Perihelia of around 0.3 AU will heat up the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield by a few hundred degrees Celsius. However, this engineering masterpiece will generate data that may provide us scientific insights for important Solar scientific objectives like:", "Cameras, magnetometers and detectors for charged particles will provide \u201cdata puzzle pieces\u201d that will allow us to create a sophisticated picture of our nearest star.", "Two months before launch a new comet was discovered: C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). ATLAS is a long-period comet (The Origin of Comets) with an aphelion of around 650 AU and a perihelion of around 0.25 AU. The perihelion passage was on the last day of May.", "A few weeks before, observations with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that the comet broke up into several pieces. The hope of a new Great Comet was gone \u2026", "\u2026 however scientists determined that dust and ion tail of the comet pass through the trajectory of the Solar Orbiter [1]! And with its instruments, the spacecraft is able to do bonus science by flying through the comet\u2019s remnants.", "But how can scientists determine such a close encounter? What kind of parameters need to be studied to identify unplanned, great scientific opportunities in space?", "Take a look at the sketch below. You see the Sun in the centre of our Solar System, orbited by the comet ATLAS (white) and the Solar Orbiter (red). The dust tail is shown in grey and the ion tail points radially away from the Sun (blue). To successfully perform measurements within the ion tail, the following constraints must be fulfilled (that will be analysed in the programming part):", "Let\u2019s dive into the Python code. Today, we will need again spiceypy and our comet database that was created in a previous session (Comets \u2014 Visitors from afar). Due to its small size, the database is also stored in my GitHub repository.", "The movement of comet ATLAS is determined by using the orbital elements that are stored in the database. For the Solar Orbiter, we need the corresponding spk kernel to compute the spacecraft\u2019s trajectory. ESA provides an FTP repository with all required kernels:", "\u2026 that is also uploaded on the GitHub repository, set a relative path into the kernel meta file and load it:", "For the comet\u2019s orbital elements we need the G*M value of the Sun (gravitational constant times mass). We extract this information with the function bodvcd and assign a constant in line 3.", "Now, we need to extract the orbital elements from the database. The set connection (line 2) is needed to execute an SQL query in line 5 to 10 with the pandas function read_sql. All required elements are extracted that are needed later for the SPICE function conics that converts these information to state vectors. The name of the comet is C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS).", "Spatial and angular information are stored in AU and degrees, respectively. These values need to be converted to km (line 13 to 16) and radians (line 21 to 23). With convrt we can easily transform the km values to AU.", "In line 21 to 23 a for-loop is applied that iterates through all column names that contain the sub-string DEG (short for degrees, line 21). The sub-string is replaced with RAD (short for radians, line 22) and the conversion is done with the numpy function radians. Finally, we add the G*M value of the Sun (line 26).", "The pandas dataframe is now converted to a list that contains the orbital elements in an order that is required for the SPICE functions:", "According to ESA, the tail crossing was end of May 2020. Thus, we set a date-time array starting at the 20th May 2020 (line 2) to the 6th June 2020 (line 3) in 1 hour steps (line 6 to 7).", "Based on the date-time array TIME-ARRAY we can now compute the corresponding state vectors of ATLAS and the Solar Orbiter. Two empty vectors will store the results (line 3 and 7). Line 10 to 19 and 22 to 32 perform the computation for both objects. One could easily merge both for-loops, however, I left it in separate one if one wants to add additional comet or spacecraft specific code. The for-loops iterate through the date-time array and convert it to Ephemeris time in line 13 / 25. Then, the state vector is computed in line 16 / 28 to 29 using conics and spkgeo, respectively. Finally (line 19 and 32) the positional components are appended to the lists and are later converted to numpy arrays in line 35 and 36.", "Let\u2019s check the first requirement, whether the comet is closer to the Sun than the Solar Orbiter. We compute the norm of all ATLAS and Solar Orbiter vectors and extract the minimum value (line 2 and 7). We convert the km value to AU (for better readability) and print it.", "Within our time window ATLAS is definitely closer to the Sun. Actually, one should analyse the distances for all time steps, but our computation covers only a few days and we already knew, thanks to the ESA article, that the comet is way closer to the Sun currently.", "Second geometric consideration: the minimum distance between the orbit of the comet and the orbit of the spacecraft. This computation can be performed from a theoretical perspective, implementing some optimization algorithm \u2026 Here, we use a quick and simple approach by comparing all position vector distances between ATLAS and the Solar Orbiter. For this purpose, we need the module scipy. The function spatial.distance.cdist requires 2 lists of vectors and computes a matrix that contains all distances between these 2 lists (line 5). We print the minimum value in line 8 to 9.", "The minimum distance between both orbits is around 40,000,000 km, so around 25 % of the distance between the Earth and Sun.", "Now we need to consider the timing! When does ATLAS reach the point where both orbits have their minimum distance? Is it before the Solar Orbiter reaches its point? Remember: ATLAS has to reach his point first, since the ion tail needs to develop and move towards the orbit of the Solar Orbiter. In this code part, we extract the indices of the computed distance matrix that correspond to the ATLAS and Solar Orbiter vectors that define the minimum distance (line 6 and 7). Let\u2019s print the indices for both objects.", "The index of ATLAS is smaller; that\u2019s great! Now let\u2019s take a look at the corresponding times. When does ATLAS and when does the Solar Orbiter reach their orbit position where both orbits have the closest approach (line 3 to 5)?", "ATLAS reaches his point on the 1st of June 2020, the Solar Orbiter follows around 8.5 days later. Let\u2019s assume an ion tail velocity of 100 km/s. Leaving the comet\u2019s vicinity the ions travel 8,640,000 km a day. After 4.6 days the ions travelled the distance of 40 Million kilometres. 4 days later the Solar Orbiter reaches the tail. Is it too late? Thankfully no. The velocity of 100 km/s is a very simple approach and may differ significantly from the actual velocity distribution.", "So the distance is 40 Million kilometre (rather small in astronomical scales), and the timing appears to be feasible. The last question is: does the ion tail really point to the Solar Orbiter\u2019s direction? In our computation, we only consider the points where both orbits have their closest approach. The smallest angular distance may also be at a different time, considering the inclination of the orbits. This may be a task for you to work on!", "But what is the pointing of the ion tail? Well, since the ion tail points radially away to the anti-Sun direction, we can simply use the position vector of the comet itself! We get the position vectors of ATLAS (line 7) and the Solar Orbiter (line 8) and compute their corresponding norm (line 11 and 12, using vnorm). The dot product is computed (line 15) to finally determine the angle between the position vector of ATLAS and the spacecraft (line 18 and 19). In line 23 to 25 we print the angular distance.", "The minimum angular distance is 7.7 degrees. Does it mean that we cannot detect anything with the Solar Orbiter instruments? Well, again, it depends. The ion tail is rather narrow, but its distribution and movement are influenced severely by the radiation and Solar Wind. Consider the ion tail of comet Encke as shown below. The Sun is in the top right corner and you can easily see the tail pointing to the lower left. The tail changes its shape, width and movement all the time. These rapid changes apply also for comet ATLAS. The question is, was the Solar Orbiter lucky enough?", "With our Python and SPICE skills, we were able to re-construct a very recent event! Of course, we simplified some geometric considerations, however, we learned how to quickly create a method to find bonus science opportunities for spacecraft missions that were designed for a completely different task. Go ahead, take the comet database, download more spk kernels from other spacecraft missions and maybe you find a yet unknown opportunity as a citizen scientist!", "Your home for data science.
