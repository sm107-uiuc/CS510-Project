In other words, you can\u2019t just count up the number of RNA pieces made from Gene A and conclude that because there are 100 pieces of RNA from Gene A, that means that 100 versions of Protein A were produced. Sometimes, RNA is not made into protein at all. Sometimes, a certain piece of RNA is used to make many proteins, and other times, a piece of RNA is used to make only a few proteins.
