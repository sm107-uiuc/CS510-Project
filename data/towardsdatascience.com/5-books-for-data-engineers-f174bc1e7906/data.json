So, I share some thoughts on what was influential in each one to help you start with what fits you.", "Author Jay Kreps, who is one of the developers of Kafka and Samza, says that the logs, that we usually perceive in the form of a web server like Nginx, takes the central role in the database and distributed system and it has many benefits in log-centric designs and consensus compared to other alternatives.", "And, he addresses some practical examples: \u2018Data Integration\u2019, \u2018Real-Time data processing\u2019, and \u2018Distributed System Design\u2019.", "One of them is the role of the logs as a \u2018Single source of truth\u2019 in a form of integrated logs between many \u2018Write\u2019 systems and \u2018Read\u2019 systems disabling the coupling of the two.", "I put it on the first because you could get in the other distributed data system with the viewpoint of Jay Kreps that simplify the essential architecture of them.", "Many of you definitely heard of it before. It covers the core concepts and common implementation of them, from the early days of the data system(RDB, NoSQL) to the distributed environment(Hadoop and others).", "The core concepts, which usually trigger you to doubt your understanding of them, are thoroughly handled: Data Model, Data Structure, Encoding and Schema Evolution of Database or Replication, Partitioning, Transaction, Main Issues of the distributed system.", "It also gives you a perspective rather than \u2018how to\u2019 on Hadoop with the Lambda Architecture.", "Personally, I frequently go back to this and remind myself whenever I feel conceptually-polluted.", "This book, which is free on the Unravel site, teaches you who are the stakeholders in the data environment and what the landscape of data ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) looks like.", "It uses many simple metaphors but practical enough to make you \u2018feel\u2019 how it would be like to work as a data engineer in the environment described in the book.", "There\u2019s a comprehensive book written by the same author, Ted Malaska, but I think this concise book would be sufficient for your knowledge base and then you could find your way by googling.", "For the professionals who struggle with Hadoop services, it is hard to find valuable resources to solve practical problems including HDFS, Yarn, Oozie, Sqoop, etc.", "If you faced questions like \u2018What kind of server configurations and specifications do we need when we install HDFS?\u2019, \u2018How to optimize Yarn memory and CPU usage?\u2019, this long and detailed book would be a good reference that you could stop by at first.", "If you feel it\u2019s a bit long, then you can only finish the HDFS, Yarn, Spark architecture part(~ 351 Pages), and get back when you need more.", "As you guess from the above chart that I draw, this book is filled with technical resources surrounding Hadoop stacks when you build a scaled data center.", "Whereas the former one(4) focuses on the feature of Hadoop services, this teaches you service-external topics: specifications of server, network, and OS for the Hadoop environment, and virtualization, etc.", "You\u2019ll find wonderful images that could be registered with and frame your viewpoint on how the Hadoop services work with the underlying infrastructure.", "For those who taste a bit of the Hadoop stack and want to know more about \u2018Does the vCores in Yarn applications correspond to a physical core or virtual core(in the virtual env)?\u2019 and \u2018How the file system driver(etx3, ext4) or page cache setting affect the HDFS performance?\u2019, this is an invaluable resource to feed your curiosity.", "Your home for data science.
