Building ML models and Predictions (covered in Part 2 post)", "Github link for the entire project: Hourly_Energy_Consumption_Prediction.", "Electrical utilities need to diligently plan ahead of time the allocation of generating units in their power plants to match their regional energy demand because if the demand is higher than the generation, it can cause several blackouts resulting in a huge loss to the economy; on the other hand, if the generation is higher than the demand the extra electricity will be wasted and it can also create an unnecessary load on the transmission lines.", "So, it is very important for the utilities to have a forecast of the energy consumption to be able to allocate appropriate resources to meet their demand. A year, month, or day-ahead forecast can help the utilities plan for a larger time scale, but for smoother daily operations an hourly (or even better) forecast can prove very useful. For example, if the plant operators get a high energy forecast for the next hour, they can ramp up the energy supply by switching on more power plants.", "In this project we will analyze past 5 years of hourly energy consumption data of SDGE utility to find trends in energy consumption around hour of the day, day of the week, season of the year, etc., and also to check if factors like outside temperature and solar installations in the region affect the energy consumption.", "The developed prediction model can be utilized by the electrical utilities to effectively plan their energy generation operations and balance the demand with appropriate supply.", "Enough with the terminology, let\u2019s put the rest of \u2018our energy\u2019 into building some time series models.", "Note: At the time of the project, data was available only till July 2019, but if you check now (May 2020), data is available on the website for all the months of 2019. The analysis shown in this post considers only the full years\u2019 data from 2014\u20132018 but the remaining months of 2019 can be added easily using the same code.", "Note: (Updating in May, 2022). It was brought to my attention that the archive link for pre-2019 data is no longer active, and I was not able to find the updated link on the site either. But since 2020, more data has been generated and the \u2018Historical hourly load data from EMS\u2019 section in this link has data from Jan 2019 until mid 2022 which should be enough for this project.", "The above code will give us the past 5 years of hourly energy consumption values for 4 of the CAISO utilities, namely PGE, SCE, SDGE, and VEA.

We will later also analyze the trend of the data.", "Other date-time parameters were added to the dataframe as shown below:", "non-working: the day is either a federal holiday or a weekendseason: November-May: winter and June-October: summer (as per SDGE link)", "To see the impact of weather (specifically the temperature) on energy consumption, we\u2019ll import the hourly temperature data from gov.noaa.ncdc. There are two or more weather stations in San Diego at which the weather data has been recorded. Since weather data at airports is generally more accurate and not biased by nearby buildings and industries we\u2019ll use the San Diego International airport data for this project.

So, we can test the theory that maybe solar capacity installed in the San Diego region has increased over the years, and thus more and more customers are using less energy when the sun is out, causing a total reduction in energy consumption. We can test this theory by importing the solar installations data in SDGE territory.", "The solar installations data was imported from California DistributedGeneration Statistics site (direct data link). This dataset contains a lot of parameters but we will focus on,- \u2018approval date\u2019: which represents the date when the system was connected to the grid became active and,- \u2018System Size AC\u2019: which represents the total kW power in AC of the solar panels installed at a site.", "To get more details about the data, you can check this workbook in my repo.", "Basically, the idea is, if the customers have more PV at their end, they will rely less on the grid for the power supply (at least when the sun is out) thus decreasing the overall energy demand.

Visualizing the distribution of energy values for different years", "This peak shift to the left can be assumed to be caused by increasing renewable energy installations at customer sites (called behind-the-meter) and increasing participation of customers in demand response programs resulting in lower peak demand on the grid.", "3.1.

Exploring energy and weather data together", "pearson correlation coefficient and pvalue for winter: 0.32pearson correlation coefficient and pvalue for summer: 0.65", "As observed in section 3.1 above, the energy consumption for daylight hours seems to have decreased from 2014 to 2018. Now, this can be due to stricter energy efficiency measures being mandated, or increase in incentives for different categories of ratepayers (residential, commercial, agriculture, etc.) to install self-generation resources like solar, wind, etc. and/or energy storage on their premises to avoid the higher energy demand. It was observed that the energy consumption decrease over the years is more dominant over the daylight hours, so we can test the theory that maybe solar capacity installed in the utility region has increased over the years, which it has as we will see below.", "Also, \u201cSan Diego, another of the top-ranking US cities for sunshine, gets more sun in winter than in summer\u201d. (Reference link)", "We have seen the effects of temperature and PV installation capacity on the energy demand of San Diego city. The energy demand is significantly higher in the summer months than in winter, due to higher temperatures. And the installed solar panels capacity also seems to have a slight (reducing) effect on energy consumption over the years. And, the energy consumption has multiple seasonal patterns.", "In Part 2 of this post, we will start from building simple short term forecasting models using traditional forecasting algorithms like SARIMAX and also linear regression. We will then also try our hands at long term forecasting using non-linear approaches like Random forest, XGBoost as well as an ensemble model (XGBoost + FB Prophet).", "Thanks for reading. See you in Part 2.", "Disclaimer: I chose San Diego out of all the utilities because, i. it serves a smaller region than other utilities so we can use temperature data from a single source without expecting much variation (actually San Diego has a wide variation in weather patterns, but we will neglect that for this project) and ii.
