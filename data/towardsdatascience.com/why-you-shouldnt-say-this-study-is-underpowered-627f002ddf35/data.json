This ended up being a popular tweet, which I wasn\u2019t expecting (it is a rather arcane statistical point) but given its centrality to some of the recent issues in experimental design, I thought it was worth revisiting in a blog post.", "First, we have to talk about what power is, because \u2014 ironically \u2014 this is very much misunderstood by everyone, including the statistical reform movement. People that complain that p values are misunderstood go right on and screw up power.", "The first thing to clear up, as I\u2019ve stated above, is that study or an experiment is not underpowered; rather:", "A design and test combination can be underpowered for detecting hypothetical effect sizes of interest.", "The easiest way to see this is that I can choose to apply a number of tests to data from the same design; for example, I might choose to use a sign test, a t test, or a Wilcoxon test; I might choose to test a hypothesis about the variances instead of the means, or about the minimum or maximum observations in the groups. All of these tests have different \u201ceffect sizes\u201d, and all of them can be applied to the same design, but each relies on different summaries of the data as the statistical evidence. Power also depends on a choice of \u201cdecision\u201d criterion, which will often be chosen with reference to a chosen (but changeable) \u03b1 (Type I error) probability.", "There is a subtle, but important point that is often missed about power. The actual, true value of the effect size in question is not mentioned in the definition. That\u2019s odd, right? Most people seem to think about power as being computed for the true value if there is indeed an effect. This is a misconception. It would make a significance test into a sort of pseudo-Bayesian test, where we\u2019d need to specify some quantity that we believed were plausible. But that\u2019s not how significance tests work.", "The same design and statistical test combination has the same power (curve) regardless of whether we apply it to a Stroop experiment with a large, easily-replicable effect or, say, an extrasensory perception experiment which has none. Some people find this strange, but this is exactly how we think of sensitivity in other contexts. The same design of smoke alarm in a burning house has the same sensitivity as one in a house that is not on fire because the sensitivity is based on a counterfactual state, not the actual state of the world. What could be, not what is.", "Imagine if it were otherwise: a person in a house that was not on fire might say that their smoke alarm has \u201clow power\u201d (sensitivity) merely because it has never gone off. This is analogous to the way that some try to \u201cestimate\u201d power from data (e.g., post hoc power, or estimating \u201cunknown\u201d power). In truth, none of that sort of work has anything to do with statistical power, except in the trivial sense that the mathematical equations are the same.", "We\u2019d really be better off thinking about \u201cdesign sensitivity curves\u201d rather than the confused monster \u201cpower\u201d has become. Talking about Type I and Type II errors/probabilities (and the \u201cstate of nature\u201d) has made people think that these are discrete, true probabilities rather than reflecting possibilities on a curve.", "Let\u2019s build up an example. For a few minutes, forget about \u03b1, \u03b2, and Type I and Type II error \u201crates\u201d.", "Suppose worked for a candy company and had determined that our new candy would be either green or purple. We\u2019ve been tasked with finding out whether people like green or purple candy better, so we construct an experiment where we give people both and see which one they reach for first. For each person, the answer is either \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cpurple\u201d. Let\u2019s call \u03b8 the probability of picking purple first, so we\u2019re interested in whether \u03b8>.5 (that is, purple is preferred). There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t test other hypotheses that might be interesting to a candy maker (e.g., \u03b8>.7, \u201cpurple is substantially preferred\u201d); we\u2019re just building this test for demonstration.", "Suppose we fix our design at N=50 people picking candy colors. We now need a test. Obviously, in this case the evidence in the data is carried by the number of people we observe who pick purple first. So we set a criterion on that number, for example: \u201cIf 31 or more people pick purple, we\u2019ll say that purple is preferred (i.e., \u03b8>.5)\u201d. We can now draw the power/sensitivity curve for the design and test, given all the potential, hypothetical effect sizes (shown in the figure to the left, as curve \u201cA\u201d).", "A \u201cpower analysis\u201d is simply noting the features of this curve (perhaps along with changing the potential design by increasing N). Look at curve A. If green candies are preferred (\u03b8<.5) we have a very low chance of mistakenly saying that purple candies are preferred (this is good!). If purple is substantially preferred (\u03b8>.7), we have a good chance of correctly saying that purple is preferred (also good!). These are all counterfactuals that would hold in any situation where we would apply this test with this design: candies, true/false tests, coin flips, whatever. The power doesn\u2019t depend on what\u2019s true, only what could be true, and how we set up the design/test.", "Now let\u2019s consider another test for this design: \u201cIf 26 or more people pick purple, we\u2019ll say that purple is preferred (\u03b8>.5)\u201d. This could be motivated by saying that we\u2019ll claim that purple is truly preferred whenever the data seem to \u201cprefer\u201d purple. This is curve \u201cB\u201d in the figure above. Let\u2019s do a power analysis. If purple is substantially preferred (\u03b8>.7), we are essentially sure to correctly say that purple is preferred (good!). If green candies are preferred, (\u03b8<.5) we could have a high chance (over 40%) of mistakenly saying that purple candies are preferred (this is bad!).", "Crucially, what determines our judgment about a power/sensitivity curve is whether it meets our purposes. We want to be sufficiently protected from often making false claims (saying \u201cpurple is preferred\u201d when green actually is), and we want to be able to say \u201cpurple is preferred\u201d when it is to some important degree. What is important is determined by us. Do I care if purple candies are preferred at \u03b8=.500001? No. I don\u2019t care about detecting effects that small. But if 70% of the time people reach for the purple candy, (\u03b8>.7), I would care. So I make sure my power/sensitivity curve is high in that region.", "A design sensitivity analysis \u2014 what is often called a power analysis \u2014 is just making sure the sensitivity is low in the region where the \u201cnull\u201d is true (in common lingo, \u201ccontrolling\u201d \u03b1), and making sure the power/sensitivity is high where we\u2019d care about it. None of this has anything to do with \u201cestimating\u201d power from previous results, or anything to do with the actually true effect.", "Now we that we\u2019ve explored the concept of power from the proper perspective, we can better understand what a good power critique looks like. Here are some things we could say to critique a study on power grounds. Power critiques are design critiques!", "Pick the effect size first: \u201cThis design has poor sensitivity to even very large effect sizes of X; the experiment should never have been done in the first place.\u201d This is perfectly cogent design critique, even after the study is done. You don\u2019t get credit for a badly designed study just because it happened to be \u201csignificant\u201d. Importantly, though, this critique involves the critic committing to some effect size of interest. You can\u2019t make a power critique without that committment. \u201cThis sample size feels small\u201d is not good enough.", "Pick the power first: \u201cThis design has no more than 0.5 power to detect effect sizes as large as X. It seems like the authors would want to detect an effect if it were indeed that large\u201d. Many people have difficulty understanding what an \u201cimportant\u201d effect size might be. I sympathise; that\u2019s why I think it is easier to choose the \u201cbasement\u201d power of 0.5 and then work out to what effect size the design has 0.5 power than it is to pick an effect size that is just important enough. If power is 0.5, you\u2019ll be as often to miss an effect as detect it, so a power of 0.5 is a good starting place to evaluate a design. It\u2019s not the end-point, but it can easily catch very bad designs.", "Focus on other aspects of the design: \u201cThe test of interest is appropriate, but the sample size in the chosen design is so small that checking the assumptions of the test is difficult or impossible.\u201d This is a critique of the sensitivity to things that might cause you to question the results. A crucial part of a data analysis is quality control, and if you can\u2019t do quality control before your analysis of interest, you should have little faith in your analysis. A design plan should not only encompass the test/effect of interest, but also any quality checks.", "Importantly, these critiques are of the experimental design, not the results. You could go beyond the design critique; the flip side is if the effect in question is significant, it implies that the effect size must be very large, because if it were smaller, it would have little chance of being detected. Scientific judgment then comes into play about the plausibility of the results, given what might actually be true. But this extension is not a power critique, and critics should not hide behind \u201cpower\u201d when their actual critique is one of plausibility. Plausibility critiques are harder to make because they are subjective, but you just have to own the subjectivity and take responsibility for it.", "For more on this issue, you can see Mayo and Morey (preprint) on why power critiques involving the so called \u201cposterior predictive value\u201d or \u201cfalse discovery rate\u201d are questionable (at best) or Morey and Lakens (preprint) on why the way power is poorly conceived in popular replication studies. Yes, I\u2019m writing this to procrastinate on getting those papers revised and submitted, but I hope it was a good primer.", "Your home for data science.
