Therefore, clustering algorithms look for similarities or dissimilarities among data points. Clustering is an unsupervised learning method so there is no label associated with data points. The algorithm tries to find the underlying structure of the data.", "There are different approaches and algorithms to perform clustering tasks which can be divided into three sub-categories:", "In this post, I will try to explain DBSCAN algorithm in detail. If you would like to read about other type of clustering algorithms, you can also visit the following posts:", "Partition-based and hierarchical clustering techniques are highly efficient with normal shaped clusters. However, when it comes to arbitrary shaped clusters or detecting outliers, density-based techniques are more efficient.", "For example, the dataset in the figure below can easily be divided into three clusters using k-means algoritm.", "The data points in these figures are grouped in arbitrary shapes or include outliers. Density-based clustering algorithms are very effienct at finding high-density regions and outliers. It is very important to detect outliers for some task, e.g. anomaly detection.", "DBSCAN stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. It is able to find arbitrary shaped clusters and clusters with noise (i.e. outliers).", "The main idea behind DBSCAN is that a point belongs to a cluster if it is close to many points from that cluster.", "There are two key parameters of DBSCAN:", "Based on these two parameters, points are classified as core point, border point, or outlier:", "These points may be better explained with visualizations. The following figure is taken from Wikipedia:", "In this case, minPts is 4. Red points are core points because there are at least 4 points within their surrounding area with radius eps. This area is shown with the circles in the figure. The yellow points are border points because they are reachable from a core point and have less than 4 points within their neighborhood. Reachable means being in the surrounding area of a core point. The points B and C have two points (including the point itself) within their neigborhood (i.e. the surrounding area with a radius of eps). Finally N is an outlier because it is not a core point and cannot be reached from a core point.", "We have learned the definitions of parameters and different type points. Now we can talk about how the algoritm works. It is actually quite simple:", "Note: A point that is marked as noise may be revisited and be part of a cluster.", "The distance between points is determined using a distance measurement method as in k-means algorithm. The most commonly used method is euclidean distance.", "By applying these steps, DBSCAN algorithm is able to find high density regions and separate them from low density regions.", "A cluster includes core points that are neighbors (i.e. reachable from one another) and all the border points of these core points. The required condition to form a cluster is to have at least one core point. Although very unlikely, we may have a cluster with only one core point and its border points.", "We start with creating a sample dataset using datasets module of scikit-learn. After creating the sample data points, we will normalize the values using StandardScaler class from preprocessing module of scikit-learn.", "Note: It is important to normalize values because it makes it easier to find an appropriate distance for radius of neighborhood (eps).", "We will create a dataset with 3 clusters with 0.5 standard deviation for each cluster. Number of samples is 400 and we also choose three points as centroids (center of clusters). You can adjust these parameters however you like using make_blobs function.", "We can also plot the dataset to see how each cluster looks:", "We can now create a DBSCAN object and fit the data:", "We just need to define eps and minPts values using eps and min_samples parameters.", "Note: We do not have to specify the number of clusters for DBSCAN which is a great advantage of DBSCAN over k-means clustering.", "Let\u2019s visualize the clusters determined by DBSCAN:", "It was able to detect the outliers (marked with blue). We can access the labels of data points using labels_ attribute. Noise (or outliers) are given -1 label. Let\u2019s check the number of outliers:", "The clusters in this sample dataset do not have actually have arbitrary shapes. But DBSCAN performed really good at detecting outliers which would not be easy with partition-based (e.g. k-means) or hierarchical (e.g. agglomerative) clustering techniques. If you also apply DBSCAN to a dataset with arbitrary shaped clusters, you will see the success of DBSCAN as well.", "Thanks for reading.
