In the following article, I am going to talk about why motivation is so important when studying data science, explain how you can get and stay motivated, and share with you a copy of my personal learning curriculum and scoring system for learning data science.", "Why is motivation so important when learning data science? If you Google something like \u2018what skills are needed for a career in data science\u2019 you will be presented with an extensive list of skills.", "Data science is cited as being its own discipline, but each of these areas is a discipline in itself. How then do you learn what appears to be an insurmountable set of skills in a reasonable amount of time? How do you know which skills to learn first? When starting out it can be very easy to quickly become demotivated and abandon your learning in the face of what appears to be an almost impossible task.", "\u201cNobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. Without motivation, you\u2019ll end up stopping halfway through and believing you can\u2019t do it, when the fault isn\u2019t with you \u2014 it\u2019s with the teaching\u201d, Vik Paruchuri", "So why does the discipline of data science appear to need so many skills? A quick job search containing the words \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019 will give you an insight. Below are just a snapshot of jobs I found from a recent job search I did back in July. Each of these jobs would fall under the data science umbrella but each one requires a different set of skills.", "At the beginning of your journey, it is really important to have a plan. To make a plan you will first need a goal. In the face of rapidly changing technology within data science, and job roles and requirements changing regularly, I believe it is best not have a goal that is tied to a specific job title. By the time you get there that job may no longer exist.", "Instead your goal should be a purpose, in other words, think about what it is that you want to be able to do. For example, my goal when I was learning data science was to \u2018make a positive impact with data\u2019. In order to make the biggest impact in the shortest possible time frame, my learning became focussed around the applied side of data science.", "your goal should be a purpose, in other words, think about what it is that you want to be able to do", "The most important skills on my list became around software development, data engineering, using existing data science libraries and knowing enough mathematics and statistics to understand what is going on and how to interpret results. If I was more focused on creating new ways to model data then my skills might have been more focussed on a research data science role and therefore the areas where I needed deeper knowledge would differ considerably.", "Ok, so you have your goal and you know which set of skills you should be focussing most of your time on. In order to achieve your goal most efficiently, you need to make sure that you only learn the skills that are directly relevant to your goal. Additionally, you will more than likely have a background when transitioning into data science. For instance, you might have previously worked in software engineering or have an advanced maths degree. In which case, there will be areas in which you will already have extensive knowledge.", "I recommend that rather than relying on an online course or educational institute to give you a curriculum that you instead create your own. There are so many fantastic resources out there for learning data science, many of them completely free (I previously wrote an article on my top 5). You can put together your own curriculum from material that suits your goals, background and learning style.", "I wouldn\u2019t dismiss online courses but my suggestion is rather than completing one or two of the popular MOOC\u2019s (massive open online courses) to get the certificates. Instead, you pick and choose the relevant parts from a number of different courses. These days more and more course platforms such as Coursera are moving to subscription-based models so you pay on a per month basis rather than having to pay a one-off course fee. In addition to being able to choose the most relevant parts of the course for your individual learning path, you can also learn in a more cost-effective way.", "Once you have your goals set and your curriculum determined you need some way to remain motivated. I recommend doing three things:", "Here is a link to the roadmap I used when learning data science. When you open this you will be asked to make a copy, this will create an editable version on your own Google drive. If you prefer, I have also written a version of this into a series of blog posts they can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
