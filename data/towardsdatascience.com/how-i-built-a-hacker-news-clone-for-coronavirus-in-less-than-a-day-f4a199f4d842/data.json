For live stats, visit this page. I am not going to iterate line by line about how to write the code, if you want it, check this Github repo. I have also added all the news collected in the past 3\u20134 days.", "I wanted to keep track of the latest updates about the contagious Coronavirus outbreak. Scrolling through social media was one option but given the amount of fake news and clickbaits that circulates in social media these days, I prefer consuming news from reliable news portals. The problem was there were many. So I thought maybe this is the time to use my coding skills to build something useful.", "Crawling is one of my regular jobs and I have created news crawler before. Almost every time I used Scrapy for scraping and crawling because of a lot of things that come built in with it. I didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel and more importantly I was already comfortable with Scrapy.", "RSS are uniform for almost all websites so I decided to use it to get the news. That way I would only write one parser which works for all the websites. All I needed to do was add more urls to the list and the script would handle it. A typical item in RSS feed would looks like this", "Next step was to scrape the data. I wanted the headlines, link and published date and I needed a way to select coronavirus related news only to show on my page. A straightforward approach was to match keywords. So I made a list of keywords and a function that will check if the title and the description has one of these keywords and either insert it into database or ignore it. All these steps are documented in the rss_scraper.py file.", "So the first thing I thought was to make this as quick as possible. I didn\u2019t want to waste more time so focussed on building a simple MVP. And I admit that I am horrible with design and frontend stuff. So I did what every developer does i.e. find a suitable template. Normally I would search \u201cFree bootstrap news template\u201d but as I said I didn\u2019t want to waste much time. The simplest ever UI I had ever seen is of Hacker News. So I copied all the HTML, CSS from their website, deleted the extra stuff and made some changes like color, footer.", "The options were limited for me as I only know Python and beginner level JavaScript/NodeJS. It was either Flask or Django for me. Django is great but I wanted a single page app, hardly 2\u20133 pages so it would be an overkill. Flask is popular for its minimal approach so I chose it.", "The database used is MySQL. I created a single endpoint /corona-news that queries the database and returns a list of dictionaries to the template where they would be rendered as HTML. As in Hacker News, I set a limit of 30 items per page. Click on this link to visit the page.", "I found this website which was updating the number of reported cases, deaths and recovered patient statistics. They also had a link to google sheet where the aggregated data was kept. I used the google sheet to periodically download the file and display the data in a tabular format. For the live counts and statistics, visit this page.", "I used a Linode VPS with Ubuntu for deployment. Follow this guide from DigitalOcean to deploy a Flask app using Nginx and uWSGI on Ubuntu.", "I hope this page will be helpful for some of you to get the latest updates about coronavirus and this outbreak will be under control ASAP.", "Your home for data science.
