In offline handwriting recognition, text is analysed after being written. The only information that can be analysed is the binary output of a character against a background. Although shifts towards digital stylus for writing gives more information, such as pen stroke, pressure and speed of writing, there is still a necessity for offline methods, when online is inaccessible. It is particularly necessary for historical documents, archives, or mass digitisation of hand-filled forms.", "Extensive research into this field has resulted in significant progress from classical methods, right up to human-competitive performance. This article serves as an overview of that journey, and the potential future of the field.", "Handwritten text classi\ufb01ers were \ufb01rst required for classi\ufb01cation of postal mail. Using scanning equipment, hardwired logic recognised mono-spaced fonts. The \ufb01rst Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software developed in 1974 by Ray Kurzweil. By reducing the problem domain, the process was more accurate. This allowed for recognition in handwritten forms. Foremost, it lacked e\ufb03ciency and knowledge of unexpected characters. These classical techniques carried heavy limitations in two key areas:", "Neural networks are able to learn features from analysing a dataset, and then classify an unseen image based on weights. A great introduction on neural networks can be found here. Features are extracted in the convolutional layers, where a kernel is passed over the image to extract a certain feature. In the end result, multiple kernels learn all the features within a dataset, in order to make classifications. This solves the issue of feature extraction in OCR methods.", "Furthermore, using neural networks on a database, rather than classical methods, means no manual hardcoding is needed. Instead, parameters are learnt during the training process. This makes deep learning methods more resilient to changes in handwriting styles, and alleviates the challenges in feature extraction in classical methods. However, the output accuracy depends strongly on the quality and completeness of the dataset used in the training process.", "The creation of the MNIST Database propelled research towards using neural networks for handwriting recognition. The database contains 70,000 handwritten digits, and has been used in deep learning since 1998. In LeCuns\u2019 pioneering paper, heads were turned by the introduction of neural networks for handwriting. Using LeNet-5, and distorting the MNIST digits, an error rate of 0.7% was immediately achieved \u2014 A vast improvement from classical methods.", "Beyond this, neural networks have been used to classify even unseen alphabets. This means, models can be generalised for any language, and does not require training on a speci\ufb01c character database, such as MNIST. Graves produced 91.4% accuracy on an unseen arabic characters.", "The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) peaked in 2011, when Ciresan analysed handwriting, achieving a tiny 0.27% error rate. To do this, seven deep CNNs trained identical classi\ufb01ers on data, pre-processed in di\ufb00erent ways. This was made more achievable by advances in hardware, where powerful GPUs handle deep learning tasks efficiently, and are now widely used in the community. The errors di\ufb00ered as much as possible, and outputs were averaged. The results are comparable to human-like performance.", "Arguably, the two problems determined by classical methods have been solved. Neural networks can recognise any handwriting, in any style, from any alphabet. The technology is already being harnessed by the New York Times, to restore old print in their archives. Roche is analysing petabytes of medical PDFs daily, to accelerate admin in healthcare. What is next?", "Emerging research obtained into Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has led to further advancements in the field. As another approach to machine learning solutions, the introduction of CapsNets shows a future of improvements for handwriting recognition. Although fairly new on the scene, applications of CapsNets are beginning to pick up the pace, and absolve some of the limitations of CNNs.", "CapsNets improve on the results of CNNs in a number of ways, particularly the following:", "In CNNs, the spatial variance of different kernels has been a prominent issue. To resolve this using CapsNets, kernels used to determine features work together, with the aid of dynamic routing, to combine individual opinions of multiple groups (capsules). This results in equivariance among kernels, and greatly improves performance in comparison to CNNs.", "To most effectively use CNNs for the purpose of handwriting recognition, it is necessary to have large datasets containing handwritten characters. The datasets need to be large, as the model needs to learn a large amount of variance, to accommodate for different handwriting styles. CapsNets help reduce the amount of data required, whilst still maintaining high accuracy. For instance, a recent team was able to train with a mere 200 training samples per class, surpassing or achieving CNN character recognition results, whilst also able to recognise highly overlapping digits.", "So far, this article has touched on generating a digital text output from a handwritten input. Now that handwritten text has been successfully digitised, further steps can be taken to generate different forms of output.", "By coupling a text input with the spoken voice of a person, machine learning techniques has allowed for human-like text to speech. For example, Googles WaveNet introduces mel spectrograms as an input to the network, which dictates how words are pronounced, but also indicates volumes and intonations. This allows for adding emphasis on capitalised words, pauses for punctuation, whilst also compensating for spelling mistakes in the original text. The resulting speech sounds natural and human, as demonstrated in the video below.", "Deep learning methods can now turn natural language into synthesised images. Here, written descriptions for images are used to build a new, hallucinated image. This is done by training a GAN, to create realistic high resolution images from noise, until it convincingly matches the text input.", "The result generates an image which depicts the content of the written text. The below figure shows examples, where the text input has been passed through a GAN at Stage-I, to generate an image. The resolution is then improved at Stage-II, to create the final synthesised image.", "These are just a couple of machine learning applications which could see handwriting turn into a completely different output. What are you most excited to see? Have you come across any other interesting applications, where this can be taken to another level? Let me know in the responses \u2014 I\u2019d love to carry on the conversation.", "Your home for data science.
