For instance, the minimum temperature value was 4.8\u00b0C while the maximum temperature value was 28.7\u00b0C. Neither of these values lie outside the norm for typical yearly Irish weather.", "However, let\u2019s consider a more extreme example.", "Braemar is a village located in the Scottish highlands in Aberdeenshire, and is known as one of the coldest places in the United Kingdom in winter. In January 1982, a low of -27.2\u00b0C was recorded at this location according to the UK Met Office \u2014 which deviates strongly from the average minimum temperature of -1.5\u00b0C that was recorded between 1981\u20132010.", "How would an ARIMA model perform when forecasting an abnormally cold winter for Braemar?", "An ARIMA model is built using monthly Met Office data from January 1959 \u2014 July 2020 (contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v1.0).", "Here is a plot of the monthly data:", "Here is an overview of the individual time series components:", "80% of the dataset (the first 591 months of data) are used to build the ARIMA model. The latter 20% of time series data is then used as validation data to compare the accuracy of the predictions to the actual values.", "Using auto.arima, the p, d, and q coordinates of best fit are selected:", "The best configuration is selected as follows:", "The parameters of the model are as follows:", "Here is a plot of the forecasts:", "Now, a data frame can be generated to compare the forecasted with actual values:", "Additionally, using the Metrics library in R, the RMSE (root mean squared error) value can be calculated.", "It is observed that with a mean temperature of 2.87\u00b0C, the recorded RMSE of 1.78 is significantly large when compared to the mean.", "Let\u2019s investigate the more extreme values in the data further.", "We can see that when it comes to forecasting particularly extreme minimum temperatures (below -4\u00b0C for the sake of argument), we see that the ARIMA model significantly overestimates the value of the minimum temperature.", "In this regard, the size of the RMSE is just over 60% relative to the mean temperature of 2.87\u00b0C in the test set \u2014 for the reason that RMSE penalises larger errors more heavily.", "In this regard, it would seem that the ARIMA model is effective at capturing temperatures that are more in the normal range of values.", "However, the model falls short in predicting values at the more extreme ends of the scales \u2014 particularly for the winter months.", "That said, what if the lower end of the ARIMA forecast was used?", "We see that while the model is performing better in forecasting the minimum values, the actual minimums still exceed that of the forecast.", "Moreover, this does not solve the problem as it means that the model will now significantly underestimate temperature values above the mean.", "As a result, the RMSE increases significantly:", "In this regard, ARIMA models should be interpreted with caution. While they can be effective in capturing seasonality and the overall trend, they can fall short in forecasting values that fall significantly outside the norm.", "When it comes to forecasting such values, statistical tools such as Monte Carlo simulations can be more effective in modelling a potential range of more extreme values. Here is a follow-up article that discusses how extreme weather events can potentially be modelled using this method.", "In this example, we have seen that ARIMA can be limited in forecasting extreme values. While the model is adept at modelling seasonality and trends, outliers are difficult to forecast for ARIMA for the very reason that they lie outside of the general trend as captured by the model.", "Many thanks for reading, and you can find more of my data science content at michael-grogan.com.", "Disclaimer: This article is written on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without warranty.
