According to my delusions, I modeled the neurons in human brain. According to the model, I created a classification algorithm. The algorithm works pretty well and, it is unique. I implemented the algorithm in Python, and you can see the test results also given below. I also share the code in GitHub and add the link here.", "To understand the all concept, I suggest you to read some subjects before you start.

The novel algorithm is based on binary matrices of input data to create sub-clusters which are used as filters later in classification. These sub-clusters are called Probability Kernels. The developed algorithm was tested using different data-sets and shows various accuracy rate which depends on diversity of data-set and the matching value which is used for comparison of matrices. Diabetes data-set, Breast Cancer data-set and Ionosphere data-set are used for comparison of performance of the developed algorithm and already known algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayes, AdaBoost, Random Forest and, Multilayer Perceptron.
