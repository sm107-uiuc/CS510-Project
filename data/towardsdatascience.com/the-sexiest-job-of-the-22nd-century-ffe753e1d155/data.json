Instead, many of us feel misunderstood and invisible.", "We are the people who help inspire new directions for your business, reduce your risk of setting important decisions on fire, and automate the ineffable through machine learning and AI. We make your data useful, yet you make us live in resource squalor. You ask us to make our peace with:", "Unskilled leadership \u2014 If you don\u2019t have personnel skilled at leading and managing the data science function, we\u2019ll have a miserable time. Without decision-makers skilled at assigning work appropriately and making data-driven decisions, data scientists are effectively useless.", "No data \u2014 If you hire data scientists before data engineers, it usually means we have no data to work with and we must first build the data engineering function for you or we\u2019re forced to tuck and roll. If we stay, we end up doing a job other than the one you claim you\u2019re hiring us for. I\u2019ve said it and I\u2019ll keep saying it: you need high-quality data for data science to be effective. We\u2019re not magical leprechauns, so we can\u2019t make something out of nothing for you.", "Nasty tools\u200a\u2014\u200aData science developer tools are a misery. The ecosystem is fragmented, especially when it comes to AI, and even the best options are far from perfect. There\u2019s always something that makes the ride bumpy.", "If you\u2019re interviewing for a data science gig, make sure you grill your potential employer about their plan for all three of these points so you don\u2019t end up in a sad spot. Don\u2019t forget to ask about people - whose job is it to make sure you have data? Who gets fired if all your insights aren\u2019t used for anything? Who picks the tools you use and makes sure they play nice with all the other infrastructure?", "If the answer to all of these is YOU - perhaps because the company doesn't know what data science is (but wants it anyway) - then set your expectations appropriately. You\u2019re going to have to perform multiple jobs yourself, tackling them in approximately this order. Trained for #6 at school? You probably won't get to those cool Bayesian networks for a few years (and you're unlikely to do the actual lifting on them when the time comes because you'll be too busy managing the team you built). It might be a perfect fit for you, but please do look (and think!) before you leap.", "I\u2019ve written plenty about leadership and data, so it\u2019s high time I mentioned tools. Applied data scientists (including those working on ML/AI) don\u2019t want to build our tools from scratch (that\u2019s a different job - if we wanted it, we\u2019d be in it already). For example, we\u2019d much rather use an existing package to make a histogram than write the code that displays rectangles to a screen. Asking us to roll our own is like asking you to build your own microwave if you\u2019re opening a restaurant. We\u2019ll build them if we have to, but we\u2019d prefer to jump straight into the cooking.", "Sometimes the proprietary tools that management foists on data scientists are even worse than the ones they could cobble together themselves. I remember one that my friends had nicknamed \u201cSatan\u201d \u2014 as in, \u201cYeah, I know that takes one line in R but you should probably budget all day to get it working in Satan.\u201d It\u2019s hard to go through the day with a song in your heart when the tools at your disposal are horrible.", "Sometimes the trouble with available tools is in the eye of the beholder - perhaps the root of your frustration is that you\u2019ve picked up a tool that wasn\u2019t made for you. Let\u2019s take a look at two tools of Google origin. Keras is not only a beautiful API, but it was built with the data scientist in mind. For example, Keras\u2019s error messages are designed to guide the data scientist\u2019s next move, so they\u2019re concise and friendly-looking, while an equivalent mistake in TensorFlow spits out a text jumble of Dickensian proportions.", "This shouldn\u2019t surprise you if you\u2019ve got your design thinking hat on; as the industrial lathe of AI, TensorFlow was not originally designed with data science users in mind. It was made for researchers breaking new ground at Google scale\u2026 and it\u2019s good at what it\u2019s built for. It\u2019s also a tool you often feel like strangling.", "The great news for us data science types is that even TensorFlow is getting more cuddly. The new 2.0 release is moving in our direction and it shows. Let\u2019s cheer them on towards the day data scientists start saying \u201cI love TensorFlow\u201d (as opposed to \u201cI tolerate TensorFlow because it\u2019s the only thing that handles my data at this scale\u201d).", "I\u2019m delighted to be part of TensorFlow initiatives that explicitly identify data scientists as primary users. One example I\u2019m looking forward to telling you all about in a future post is the What-If Tool, which makes model understanding, bias detection, and ML data exploration easy. The team included a user experience designer tasked with making data scientists happy... from Day 1! You can sneak a look at the results here.", "It\u2019s important to take a moment to think about the origins of a tool you\u2019re considering learning as well as the communities its builders are making overtures towards as they\u2019re steering the development of new versions.", "While we\u2019re at it, if you\u2019re calling the tooling shots for your organization, don\u2019t commit to a tool before your data scientists have playtested it. You\u2019d think this would go without saying, but Satan suggests otherwise. Thinking about picking up a tool built for analysts in the retail space and plugging it right into your healthcare company? Oh dear.", "You might want to consider some tooling support from dedicated engineers so your data scientists aren\u2019t miserable. Your current analysts probably didn\u2019t sign up for dealing with what will feel like a piece of junk to them, and they might not have been around the block enough times to know to ask about tools (and engineering support for these tools!) during their interviews.", "If you\u2019re a data scientist looking for a new gig, don\u2019t forget to check that whoever you\u2019re about to trust with your career understands your needs. Ask potential employers pointed questions about data, decision-makers, and tools. Make sure they have what our kind needs to be happy and effective. Don\u2019t assume employers are ready for you this century. If you love the work, I\u2019d hate to see you become yet another Director of Data Science in a company with no data!", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
