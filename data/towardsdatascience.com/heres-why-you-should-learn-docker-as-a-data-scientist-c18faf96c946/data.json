You can package applications with their dependencies and deploy them as a single package.", "Why should you care? Because saying \u201cIt works on my machine\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it will work on the others. With Docker containers, you can be sure that the application working on your machine will work on the others.", "Think of Docker as a virtual machine without an operating system.
