Now if you know anything about\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "http://localhost:6006/", "anchor_text": "http://localhost:6006/", "paragraph_index": 8}], "all_paragraphs": ["I recently completed my first computer vision project making the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNs) built with Google\u2019s machine learning library Tensorflow. Now if you know anything about me, I like cool things. Don\u2019t get me wrong, CNNs are cool. They\u2019re probably one of the coolest parts of data science and might even be cooler than maps (which is a big statement coming from me). But with all the material out there covering the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of CNNs, I\u2019ve decided to focus on a small but important aspect of them.", "Training a CNN can be an extremely resource-intensive task. This article doesn\u2019t go into the details of building one, but if you\u2019re using TensorBoard, you should really make sure you\u2019re resources are set up. Thankfully, I\u2019m working on a fairly capable desktop now but this same model would turn my poor laptop into an incredibly loud yet inefficient space heater. Using a GPU will be much easier on your machine and will also save time. I\u2019m talking potentially hours to train a model down to minutes or seconds. If you\u2019re working on a laptop or haven\u2019t configured Tensorflow to utilize your GPU, do yourself a favor and get comfortable using Google Colab. It\u2019s a free resource that provides GPU accelerated processing for all your machine learning needs! Here\u2019s a great article to get you started.", "Now it doesn\u2019t make any sense for you to spend all this time building a model if you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s performing. While building multiple iterations of the model, I found it difficult to keep track of the changes between each iteration, and what the effect on the outcome was. I made charts to quickly display the accuracy and loss of my training and validation sets after fitting each model, but comparing them together involved scrolling through dozens of lines of code and epoch results just to see each chart.", "Sure I could combine the charts but then I\u2019d have to decipher what each line means or arrange each as a subplot, and after a dozen or so iterations things can get a bit hectic.", "What I found was TensorBoard. TensorBoard is a visualization tool built right into Tensorflow. I still have my charts in my notebook to see at a glance how my model performs as I\u2019m making different changes, but after all of the iterations, I can open up Tensorboard in my browser to see how they all compare to one another all wrapped up in a nice and easy UI.", "So far we\u2019ve talked about a lot of set-up, now we get into the charts!", "From your terminal of choice, (here I\u2019m using Anaconda prompt) navigate to your directory that contains the folder with all of your saved logs and run the command", "This launches TensorBoard locally and points out where to read your log data from (which is <logs> in my case). After you hit enter you\u2019ll see some activity shown below", "Now depending on how many logs you\u2019ve created and what version you\u2019re using you may or may not see the exact same output as shown here, but the important part is the link highlighted above \u2014 http://localhost:6006/. Copy this into your browser and you\u2019ll be met with something that looks similar to this!", "On the left side, there are a bunch of checkboxes along with what you named each log. As you can see I simply gave each model a number at first, which was a terrible way to go. I then switched to the naming convention I described above which is better but I still feel like there might be an even better way. If you have any ideas let me know!", "So what we can do now is click a few of those checkboxes on the left to start seeing the charts! You can also filter your logs if there\u2019s only a certain subset that you want to view and compare.", "Here I\u2019m showing how you can filter through logs, expand the chart, adjust the axis and smoothing, and how you can hover to view more information through the interactive chart. Another useful feature is zooming and panning through your chart.", "Before we sign off, don\u2019t forget to celebrate and dance for all of the accomplishments and progress you\u2019ve made so far!", "So there\u2019s a nice quick-start version of TensorBoard. There are still a lot of other features available including flowcharts, histograms, and time series analysis of your results all of which we may get into another time. Even with only the features I\u2019ve outlined, TensorBoard has such a useful application for saving all of your logs and being able to review and compare them at a later time. You get all your charts available to you right at your fingertips, and charts are cool.", "Your home for data science.
