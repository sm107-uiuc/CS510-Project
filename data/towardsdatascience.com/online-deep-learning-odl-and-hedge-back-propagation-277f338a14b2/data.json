However, they suffer from many convergence issues (vanishing gradient, etc.). Moreover, the optimal depth of the network is (usually) unknown, which makes the problem even harder."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["As the main concept of deep neural networks is to train through back-propagation in a batch setting, the data is required to be available in an offline setting. As a consequence, the scheme is irrelevant for many practical situations, in which the data arrives in sequence and cannot be stored. For example stocks, vehicle position, and many more. ODL is very challenging as it cannot use back-propagation. Two years ago, Sahoo et al (2018) addressed the gap between online learning and deep learning, where they claimed that \u201cwithout the power of depth, it would be difficult to learn complex patterns\u201d. They presented a novel framework for ODL (to be reviewed later).", "OL is an ML method in which data is available in sequential order, and we use it in order to predict future data at each time step. Moreover, in OL, we update the predictor in real-time. According to Shai Shalev-Shwartz: \u201cOL is the process of answering a sequence of questions given (maybe partial) knowledge of the correct answers to previous questions and possibly additional available information\u201d. The family of OL includes online convex optimization, (which leads to efficient algorithms), a limited feedback model when the system observes the loss value but does not observe the actual real value, and more (I recommend reading ref [2] for more information).", "Limitation of Back-propagation and \u201cshallow to deep\u201d concept", "Online Learning can be directly applied to deep neural networks (online back-propagation). However, they suffer from many convergence issues (vanishing gradient, etc.). Moreover, the optimal depth of the network is (usually) unknown, which makes the problem even harder. Recently, some works adapted the concept of \u201cfrom shallow to deep\u201d. According to this concept, the shallow models converge faster than the deeper models. To implements this concept, the cost function controls the number of layers (Chen et al). There are many other concepts but let\u2019s stick with this one.", "This architecture and many others are designed to optimize the cost function based on the network output / deepest layer. They cannot always yield good online performances, as the deepest layer requires meaningful time for convergence. For the online learning concept discussed, such deep learning technique based on back-propagation is not optimal.", "A notable method was suggested by Sahoo et al. In their work, they suggest that when applying HBP, the network depth is automatically adjusted based on the data itself. This hedge approach has some important properties such as:1. Determine the network depth according to the performance of the classifier in depth (Expert Advice). 2. Initialization with shallow neural network architecture \u2014 more robust. 3. It allows real-time algorithms to continuously learn and adapt (more available data).", "The following diagrams was taken from Sahoo et al paper and describe the HBP in a great manner:", "This diagram describes an online deep learning framework in the context of hedge back-propagation . The blue line represents the feed-forward flow and the green line represents the back-propagation approach. The important orange line represents the (softmax) output followed by the hedging approach during the prediction time. For more detailed information, please refer to the original paper.", "Last January (2020) Ashfahani and Pratama published a great book entitled: \u201cAutonomous Deep learning: Continual Learning Approach for Dynamic Environments\u201d. They mentioned the static and offline nature of many DL approaches and proposed a novel continuous learning algorithm that determines the network depth aside from a drift identification mechanism. They suggested to include for every layer a softmax layer which yields a local output. Then, global output is calculated using dynamic voting. The authors point four major contributions in their model: 1. Network structure with different depths (softmax layer in each hidden layer). 2. Automatically generate new hidden nodes. 3. Depth of network adaptation based on drift detection. 4. Accommodate new information while revisiting old information. It might solve the \u201ccatastrophic forgetting problem\u201d.", "To summarize the ADL concept, the adaptation of the scheme width is based on an estimation of the variance and bias while depth is determined according to drift detection method (as shown in the figure above).", "The last subject I want to discuss is noisy real-life issues. Recently, a work by T. Younesian et al (2020) was published. It deals with the problem of online noisy labeled data, which may cause the bad performance of any ODL system. In this work, they focused on streaming data with extremely noisy labels, where more than half of the labels are wrong. The main challenge is to select informative data in order to include in the learning frame. The online active learning algorithm QActor designed combines active learning with a certain quality model. This model filters out noisy labels based on different uncertain measures. This is an overview of the workflow of the original paper:", "To summarize, the domain of online deep learning is pretty new and suffer from many non-conventional issues, such as backpropagation in offline settings that we are all familiar with, and should be suitable for online settings. We discussed some recent approaches to deal with these issues such as autonomous deep learning, hedge back-propagation, and more. Lastly, we mentioned the problem of noisy labeled examples in an online setting.", "For more stories, please follow me and don\u2019t forget to clap!", "Barak Or received the B.Sc. (2016), M.Sc.
