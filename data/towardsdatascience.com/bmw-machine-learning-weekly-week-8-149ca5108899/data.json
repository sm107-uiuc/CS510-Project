It lets you make a statement or ask a question. The tool then finds a sentence in books that respond to the question or statement made, without a dependence on keyword matching. Another (far more interactive and fun) tool is \u201cSemantris,\u201d a word-association game powered by ML. Semantris basically tests your word association abilities with the same software that powers Talk to Books. It ranks and scores the words on-screen based on how well they correspond to the answers you put in. For instance, if you are given the word \u201cbed\u201d at the top of a collection of 10 words, you might think to type \u201csleep\u201d as a response. Semantris will then rank the 10 words and give you points based on how well it thinks the semantic relationship between bed and sleep is in comparison to the relationship between \u201cbed\u201d and every other word in the list. Past AI experiments from Google include \u201cQuick, Draw!\u201d, a neural network that learns how to recognize your doodling, or the \u201cInfinite Drum Machine,\u201d which lets you create beats using sounds from the everyday world.", "AI researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of British Columbia have created virtual characters capable of imitating the way a person performs martial arts, parkour, and acrobatics, practicing moves relentlessly until they get them just right. The work could transform the way video games and movies are made. Instead of planning a character\u2019s actions in excruciating detail, animators might feed real footage into a program and have their characters master them through practice. Such a character could be dropped into a scene and left to perform the actions. The virtual characters developed by the AI researcher use an AI technique known as reinforcement learning, where a virtual character experiments with its motions and receives positive reinforcement each time it gets a little closer to the motions of the expert. Reinforcement learning implies that the same algorithm can be used to train a character to do a backflip or a moonwalk.", "One Concern, a startup company in California is using ML to advise fire departments about how to plan for and respond to earthquakes. The aim of One Concern is to reduce the guesswork in the planning process for disaster response. Using data about homes, buildings, the material they are made of, when they were built, and how likely they are to collapse when the ground starts shaking, as well as data about the natural environment and live weather data, predictions are made about what would happen if an earthquake occurred in a particular area. The model is then tested in areas where past earthquakes have caused damage.", "The European Commission outlined a European approach to boost investment and set ethical guidelines for AI. It proposed a three-pronged approach to prevent \u201cbrain drain\u201d to other, non-European competition, and believes that coordinated European action is required for the EU to be at the forefront of AI development. The three goals are defined to i) boost the financial support for AI and encourage uptake by the public and private sectors, ii) prepare for socio-economic changes brought about by AI and iii) ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework concerning AI.", "Your home for data science.
