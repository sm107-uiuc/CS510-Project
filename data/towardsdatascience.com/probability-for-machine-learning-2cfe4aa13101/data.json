Know how Probability strongly\u2026 | by Samhita Alla | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Probability for Machine Learning", "description": "When implementing machine learning algorithms, you may have come across situations where the environment that your algorithm is in, is non-deterministic, i.e., you cannot guarantee the same output\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.deeplearningbook.org/", "anchor_text": "this", "paragraph_index": 43}], "all_paragraphs": ["When implementing machine learning algorithms, you may have come across situations where the environment that your algorithm is in, is non-deterministic, i.e., you cannot guarantee the same output always for the same input. Similarly in the real-world, there are scenarios such as these where the behavior can vary, though the input remains the same. Uncertainty exists no matter what. As machine learning includes humongous amounts of data, multiple hyperparameters, and a complex environment, uncertainties are bound to exist. It can be in the form of missing variables, incomplete modeling, or the data being probabilistic.", "Foraying into machine learning algorithms without understanding probability seems okay at first, nonetheless diving deep into complex algorithms might push you to revisit the fundamentals. These concepts can seem complex, precisely in comprehending how math influences machine learning. You might also wonder as to how an algorithm such as Na\u00efve Bayes is completely dependent on it!", "To simplify the concepts and help you understand the significance of probability in the machine learning world, I\u2019ll be explaining it in layman\u2019s terms.", "Probability represents the certainty factor. Certainty is the rate that you would assign to an event to happen. Say, you are rolling a dice and you say that the certainty with which a 6 shows up on the dice is \u2159. It means there\u2019s a 16.67% chance that a 6 shows up on the dice. That\u2019s the certainty you allot to that particular event. This, in turn, is known as probability, or precisely, in our case, it\u2019s called frequentist probability.", "The frequentist probability denotes the frequency with which the event can happen amongst many trials/events. Rolling a dice is frequentist as \u2159 means that out of infinitely many trials of rolling a dice, there\u2019s a 1/6th chance that 6 is going to show up.", "Not all scenarios are frequency related as in our previous assumption. If we consider a machine learning problem in which we estimate the probability of inflation or deflation of the price of fuel, we wouldn\u2019t be thinking this in the perspective of repetition, as seen in the frequentist probability scenario. Instead, we say that this event could occur with a certain probability/certainty.", "The latter phenomenon is called Bayesian probability. Rather than considering the frequency with which an event repeats, we quantify our belief. Consider the statement \u2014 there\u2019s a 32% chance that a diabetic patient is going to develop heart failure. This statement isn\u2019t prone to repetition where we create infinite replicas of the patient\u2019s symptoms. We instead quantify with a 32% certainty that heart failure could happen.", "Altogether, probability measures the extent of certainty pertaining to an uncertain event. As machine learning revolves around probable yet not mandatory situations, probability plays a crucial role in approximating the analysis.", "Formulating an easy and uncertain rule is better in comparison to formulating a complex and certain rule \u2014 it\u2019s cheaper to generate and analyze. Moreover, a \u201ccertain\u201d rule doesn\u2019t guarantee generating the right and required output always. An \u201cuncertain\u201d rule, on the other hand, though non-deterministic, helps in reaching a generalized conclusion.", "A discrete variable takes a finite set of values whereas a continuous variable takes an infinite number of values. If you have a dataset with two attributes \u2014 age group and profession, age group is continuous and profession is discrete. In probability, we define the probability of discrete variables using probability mass function (PMF).", "PMF assigns probability to every possible variable specific to the data attribute. The probability for all possible variables shouldn\u2019t exceed 1, as to how certainty shouldn\u2019t exceed 100%. Each probability concerning a variable has to lie between (included) 0 and 1. If we consider the profession attribute, we can define its probability by stating that every profession\u2019s probability has to be in between 0 and 1, and all of them have to add up to 1.", "The probability of continuous variables can be defined using probability density function (PDF). As continuous variables are not finite, we use an integral to define PDF. The probability of every possible continuous value has to be greater than or equal to zero but not preferably less than or equal to 1 as a continuous value isn\u2019t finite. Although, the integration of all probabilities has to be equal to 1.", "Probability distribution defines the likelihood of possible values that a random variable can take. PMF and PDF that have been described earlier for discrete and continuous variables respectively are probability distributions.", "If we want to determine the probability distribution on two or more random variables, we use joint probability distribution. For a typical data attribute in machine learning, we have multiple possible values. Computing probability of all values falls under joint probability.", "If we want to define the probability distribution only on a subset of variables, we use marginal probability distribution. This is useful if we want to estimate the probability on only a specific set of input variables (concerning x attribute) when given the other input values (concerning y attribute).", "There are cases where we want to compute the probability of an event when a different event happens. This probability distribution is termed as conditional probability distribution.", "Joint probability distribution can be decomposed into conditional distributions as follows:", "In this case, if the events are disjoint or independent, then the probability can be expressed as the product of all events\u2019 probabilities.", "If the events are conditionally independent, the probability is given as follows:", "Taking a cue from the joint probability distribution, we define Bayes Rule as the probability of an event computed using the prior knowledge of its related events.", "Bayes Rule plays a significant role in Bayesian statistics where probability is believed to be a degree of belief in an event.", "The expectation, or expected value is the mean of many repetitions of an event. Practically, it helps in ascertaining if one has to engage in a given event.", "A variable can take several possible values (probabilities) each of which has a likelihood attached. Summing up these details into a single variable gives expectation.", "It\u2019s given by the following formula:", "We also have conditional expected value which defines the expectation of a variable (x) given another variable (y) as follows:", "On running the above code, we get the following output:", "Variance defines how the output of an event varies as values (influencing the event) are picked from a probability distribution. It defines how the one value differs from the other values, or in simple terms, the variability of the dataset.", "If we run the above code, we get the following output:", "Standard deviation gives the spread of the dataset, as to how far the values are from the mean (expected value). It\u2019s given by the square root of variance.", "If we run the above code, we get the following output:", "Covariance defines the linear relation between two variables. If it\u2019s positive, both the variables tend to take higher values and if it\u2019s negative, when one variable takes a higher value, the other takes a lower value.", "On running the above code, we get the following output:", "17.33 is concerned with the covariance between the first input [13, 19, 21] and the same input again. -4. is concerned with the covariance between the first input and the second input [5, 4, 3] which is negative as both are of opposite orders (increasing and decreasing).", "Here are the distributions that we usually come across in machine learning:", "Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable \u2014 is 1 with a probability of p and 0 with a probability of 1-p. This is typically related to a True/False or a classification scenario.", "Multiple Bernoulli trials constitute a binomial distribution. It\u2019s the probability distribution constituting True/False questions in n trials.", "Multinoulli distribution is the case where a single variable can have multiple outcomes. It\u2019s the transition from binary to several categories. When it\u2019s a multi-classification problem, this distribution comes into the picture.", "Multiple Multinoulli trials constitute Multinomial distribution.", "Gaussian or Normal Distribution is a commonly used distribution in machine learning. Several processes in our nature take the form of Gaussian distribution. In fact, there\u2019s a Central Limit Theorem which states that the normalized sum of several independent variables is inclined towards Gaussian distribution irrespective of the distribution that each variable takes.", "Moreover, this distribution induces maximum uncertainty into the data and requires minimum prior knowledge as it can solely be defined using the mean and variance of data.", "Exponential distribution is concerned about the time until an event occurs. Mathematically, it has a sharp point at x = 0.", "I hope you have got a clearer view of what Probability brings to the table. It mathematically blends the uncertainty factor that we typically encounter in machine learning problems. Machine Learning being probabilistic to an extent demands a deeper insight into how Probability molds it the way it is.", "Probability, its types, and the distributions that the data usually picks up have been explored in this article. Both theoretical and mathematical views have been presented.", "To continue with the prerequisites required for machine learning, you can learn about linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and information theory. I find this book insightful when I want to brush up my basics. Being strong in the fundamentals is what is going to push you to excel in a field!", "Your home for data science.
