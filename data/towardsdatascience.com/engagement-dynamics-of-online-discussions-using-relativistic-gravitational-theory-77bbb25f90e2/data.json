Such analogies often rely on some very simple but powerful assumptions. The point of scientific rigour in these analogies should be carefully reminded \u2014 most of such analogies are really \u2018analogies\u2019, and not a claim towards a unified theory. In this article, we will elaborate on how the \u201cfield equations of General Theory of Relativity\u201d may come to help in modeling user engagement over online discussion platforms. First, we need to define what dynamics of engagement are that we going to model and how does the revolutionary field equations come into play.", "Let\u2019s start with a very simplistic model of user engagement in discussions. We have some discussion platforms with a fixed number of users. Now, a random user posts something \u2014 an opinion, news, a music video, or maybe a sarcastic \u2018meme\u2019. Not all users start commenting against this post; only those \u2018interested\u2019 in the topic of the post will join the discussion. This \u2018interest\u2019 is not a static phenomenon though. Over time, a particular discussion may attract users who were not previously interested.", "With this simple model of a discussion platform, we can start with two very basic assumptions: (I) users are residing at points (and moving) on an n-dimensional space such that, close neighbours have common interests; and (II) a discussion has some property which attracts different users to a varying degree. The second assumption imposes that, there can be zero attraction between a user and a discussion, but not repulsion. In reality, a user may get \u2018repelled\u2019 by a discussion, and hence choose not to participate. But it is not practically possible to identify \u2018repulsion\u2019 (\u2018dislikes\u2019 or \u2018downvotes\u2019 are also engagement) unless the user explicitly says so.", "These two assumptions reflect a striking similarity between discussion platforms and gravitational force fields. One can imagine a discussion having some \u2018mass\u2019-like property, which changes over time. This mass creates some \u2018gravitational pull\u2019 at different points of the n-dimensional userspace and depending on the degree of pull, users come to that post. To go to the further details of computing the mass and pull, we need to revisit how gravity works actually.", "By far, the most accurate description of gravity is given by Albert Einstein in his theory of General Relativity. The famous Einstein Field Equations describe gravity as a \u2018curvature of spacetime\u2019. Here, space (3 dimensions) and time (1 dimension) are not separate entities; rather, they constitute the complex amalgam of spacetime (4 dimensions). Any presence of mass-energy-momentum creates a curvature in the geometry of spacetime, and, as a result, anything moving bends its path (gets pulled) (see Fig. 1). The field equations are:", "Without going into the rigorous mathematical details, the left-hand side of the above equation corresponds to the curvature of the manifold, whereas the right-hand side corresponds to the energy-momentum density.", "From User Interaction to User Spacetime", "So if we want to develop an analogous model of user engagement, the first thing we need to do is to define a mapping of users to some fixed dimensional points (vectors). This mapping should preserve our first assumption that, common interest users must remain close. To define \u2018common interest\u2019 mathematically, we can assign three types of proximity between a pair of users:", "I) Communicative proximity: the users have replied to each other\u2019s comment or post earlier; II) Temporal proximity: the users have commented to the same discussion in near time; III) Semantic proximity: the users have commented to semantically similar posts.", "These three kinds of proximities, when taken together, assigns each pair of a user to an aggregate proximity (or co-occurrence) value. Now if we represent each user with an n-dimensional vector, such that their scalar product is proportional to their proximity, we get the desired user space. Concatenated with the time value, this produces the user spacetime.", "Getting the Energy out of Discussions", "Next task is to represent the discussions as a time-varying energy function. In a discussion forum, whether or not a discussion will draw users to itself depends on various features \u2014 the topic of discussion, the polarity of opinions expressed in the post and the comments, readability of the texts, different word usage, and users who are commenting. We can learn a parameterized non-linear function which maps these features to fixed dimensional vectors (in this case, the dimension must be the same as the user spacetime). This representation will initialize the diagonal elements of the stress-energy tensor, T\u03bcv.", "The last assumption we make to simplify the problem of engagement modeling is, users form natural clusters on the basis of common interests. So we partition the user space into clusters and predict the probability of a user coming from a particular cluster to comment against a given post for each time slice. The cluster centres are taken to be the position vectors of the clusters. We build a model which learns to compute the metric tensor", "from the cluster positions and stress-energy tensor from discussion features. These two tensors combined will give us the curvature of the user spacetime at each cluster centre for a given discussion at different time intervals. Now we can compare these curvatures to decide which clusters are more probable to be the engaging clusters. It should be kept in mind that, this simple model does not claim that online discussion platforms follow the General Theory of Relativity. Rather, it fuses user interaction history with the textual features of discussion, much analogous to how General Relativity theory provides a holistic definition of gravity, fusing the energy density with the geometry of spacetime.", "Subhabrata Dutta, Dipankar Das, Tanmoy Chakraborty.
