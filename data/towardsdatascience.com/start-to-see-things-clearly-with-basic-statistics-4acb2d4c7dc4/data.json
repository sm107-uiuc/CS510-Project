Probably it was recommended by one of the articles I read about statistics over the past few months.", "I decided to give the book a chance and, at the very beginning, I read the following:", "I usually knew what I didn\u2019t know \u2014 Charles Wheelan", "Interesting, right? Fortunately, I realized upfront that this book had a great chance to be worth it reading. Some weeks later, and with a lot of annotation, here I am. Was it really worth it?", "If you are interested in either:", "\u2026or, of course, both, you bet it\u2019s worth it.", "As a statistics book, it\u2019s expected that its foundation lies in, of course, statistics. So, it\u2019s important to highlight that you would probably need to revisit some formulas and concepts you either studied in school or at the university in order to fully follow how the analyses behind the results have been done. If you have never studied (or don\u2019t remember anything), this is absolutely a good path you could use in order to guide your basic statistics studies.", "However, this is not a post about statistics formulas or math reasoning. It\u2019s about perspective when analyzing data.", "In order for you not to be left in the dark, I listed some concepts you are going to face while reading it:", "Ok, and what do all of the above have to do with perspective, mentioned a few lines above?", "That\u2019s a mix between both the typical causation-correlation misunderstanding and unobserved differences when taking a look at a problem.", "As exactly as written in the book, \u201cPeople who take vitamins regularly are likely to be healthy -because they are the kind of people who take vitamins regularly!\u201d. Have you already got it?", "The effect of vitamin on people\u2019s health is, of course, very important, but, what else? Let\u2019s explore further\u2026 let\u2019s take a look at each part separately, sticking ourselves to the same story for both:", "Sometimes, when analyzing situations, we tend to give ourselves specific explanations for the observed results and simply disregard everything else. And most of the time, this happens unintentionally (which isn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be an acceptable explanation, depending on the case).", "Charles goes further in the book when, ironically, exploring the \u201cpurple pajamas\u201d example in Chapter 7.", "There are tons of our daily life examples, the main point here is exactly to extend this perception to the most possible number of situations we face daily. The starting question is: why does this happen? Usually, there are some insights we are already considering in order to explain why something is happening. And, usually, once we see a logical way to explain it, we stop trying to understand the problem in a more deeply way. It\u2019s not only about taking the vitamins, it\u2019s also about everything else.", "This is an expression from Latin, which means \u201cother things being equal\u201d.", "All the examples based on the hypothesis test relies on conducting \u201ca controlled experiment in which the variable of interest is the only thing that differs between the experimental group and the control group.\u201d Once again, let\u2019s use a book practical example.", "In Chapter 1, Charles raised: \u201cDoes smoking cigarettes cause cancer?\u201d. What would you say? Yes, right? Me too. However, as further explored, \u201cthe process of answering it was not nearly as straightforward as one might think\u201d. Why?", "That\u2019s because \u201csmokers and nonsmokers are likely to be different in ways other than their smoking behavior\u201d. Such as? Smokers are likely to have other habits that contribute to the development of cancer later on, such as less exercising, bad food habits, and drinking heavily. Hence, of course, smoking is an important element to be analyzed when your outcome of interest is causes of cancer, but you shouldn\u2019t try to explain the causations of cancer simply in terms of smoking and nonsmoking habits only.", "There\u2019s no way of thinking about data and don\u2019t think about COVID-19 nowadays. Of course, it\u2019s straightforward that studying a new epidemic as it evolves and, simultaneously, taking important decisions is a very difficult task for authorities, from all over the world, to do. However, have you tried to think why?", "One of the reasons is exactly what we are exploring here. Not only countries themselves, but also specific regions within countries show very different realities between each other, in several aspects. That\u2019s the reason why you probably heard someone on some news vehicle saying that social-health policies should be applied considering the reality of each region. Each region is going to present a specific infection rate, death rate, intensive therapy units (ITUs) occupation rate, population isolation rate, population size, demographic distribution, and lots of other differences. For this reason, authorities' decisions shouldn't be an one-fits-all decision for the entire country, as there\u2019s no ceteris paribus reality.", "These are just some examples and reflections provided by this amazing book. I guarantee you that there\u2019s so much more for you to be provoked. I don\u2019t want to give you any more spoilers, I really hope it\u2019s been enough to catch your curiosity.", "As mentioned in the book, \u201cstatistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands\u201d and each statistical analysis \u201cis just one weapon in an arsenal that requires good judgment\u201d. Try different perspectives, seek the whole picture, and never forget your judgment.", "Your home for data science.
