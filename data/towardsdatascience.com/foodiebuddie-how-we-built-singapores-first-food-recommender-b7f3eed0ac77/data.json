The food industry in Singapore is worth S$8.3 billion in annual receipts and makes S$4.3 billion annual contribution to the country\u2019s GDP with 48,000 workers employed. According to the Ministry of Trade & Industry\u2019s (MTI) Food Industry Transformation Map, there is a 4.5% of productivity growth and 2,000 new jobs planned for 2020. This makes Singapore\u2019s food industry an attractive sector for budding entrepreneurs.", "S$8.3 billion annual receipts, S$4.3 billion annual GDP contribution", "Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and in its aftermath, existing food businesses are hard pressed to reconsider their offerings and business strategy in order to amass enough sales to keep up or fall out of the race.", "An amazing team consisting Gracia, Jim Meng, Christal and I, hence spent a portion of our summer developing FoodieBuddie with the aim of helping new and existing food business owners maximize their share in the billion dollar food industry. FoodieBuddie recommends potentially popular food items and cuisines to businesses based on Instagram trends and identifies potential food influencers these businesses can work with to maximise their reach and exposure.", "Our primary data source is Instagram. We acknowledge the influence Instagram has on the food industry as it is not only a platform where food businesses market their food items but also a platform that influencers provide exposure to the food businesses by posting their reviews on recommended dishes. Thus, in order to identify food that is going to be trending, we looked at what the food influencers were posting. In this project, we narrowed down our scope to the accounts of the top 12 food influencers in Singapore:", "Instagram posts were scraped using Python Selenium WebDriver, BeautifulSoup and Pandas. The posts data include the food influencers\u2019 username, caption, number of likes, number of comments and the comments. These data will be used for text analysis using data engineering techniques, which will be discussed further in the following sections.", "We also scraped the followers list of the food influencers using Phantombuster. These data will be used to generate the social network graph.", "In order to identify the food mentioned in the Instagram posts, we needed a corpus of food names and their corresponding cuisine names. With Wikipedia\u2019s categories and multi-level subcategories features, a list of food is already associated to their respective cuisines, thus allowing us a quick way of generating a sizable corpus. In this project, we focused on the Singaporean cuisine sub-category and did an initial scrape for our corpus using the Wikipedia API.", "This gives us an initial scrapped corpus size of 112 unique food names associated with 9 cuisines. Most food are categorised under Chinese and Malay cuisines.", "From a visual inspection of the corpus, we found that some of the food names can be corrected and others may be referred to by alternative names. We hence did some data cleaning, correcting wrong food names and adding alternative names to the above food items, we added the below list of food names to our corpus, arriving at 129 search terms.", "After sorting the food into their respective cuisines, we realised that two major cuisines, Japanese and Korean, which are easily found in Singapore were missing. To add in these cuisines, we proceeded to web scraping.", "We started out by first scraping food names from the Japanese food blog with string parsing \u2014 this entails scraping the food names from scratch instead of using a pre-built package, by taking in the html code of the website as a string. We then used BeautifulSoup to scrape from the Korean food blog. This gave us 30 Japanese and 29 Korean food names.", "Further inspection of the corpus revealed two insights about Korean food:", "Therefore, we expanded our corpus for Korean food, adding more common Korean food names in Singapore, as well as alternative food names, resulting in a corpus that extended to 42 search terms.", "As this corpus is created independently of the Instagram dataset, we considered the possibility of food influencers being under-represented when using our corpus. And indeed, we have two influencers with a significantly low labelled post to total post ratio.", "We hence conducted Pareto Analysis and identified 9 new food names frequently posted about by the under-represented influencers.", "Adding these 9 new foods to our corpus, we obtained an outstanding result. We found that these 9 new food items increased our original number of labelled posts by close to 50%, doubling the number of labelled posts for eatbooksg, and increasing the number of labelled post for sheeatshecooks by around 66.7%.", "With our created corpus, we can now label our dataset!", "We realized that a post with many comments may not necessarily mean people like the food mentioned in the post as some comments may be criticizing the food. Hence, we got to extract the sentiments towards a post and use that as a metric instead of the number of comments.", "We gave each comment a compound sentiment score that ranges from -1 for very bad to +1, and averaged these scores to give each post a sentiment score that also ranges from -1 to +1.", "We visualised the data we have engineered thus far using Tableau. Various charts are created and assembled in dashboards. Two separate Tableau dashboards were created for new and existing business owners. The new business owner can interact with the dashboards to get a recommendation on what potentially popular food to sell and the respective suitable influencers to collaborate with. In the case when the new business owner intends to sell duck rice, kopi, and chilli crab, he/she can select the stated food items from the heatmap. Thereafter, he/she can find out which influencers have better status in terms of posting the stated food items based on their followers, number of likes, comments, and sentiment score. Hence, this allows the new business owner to reach out to the influencers to collaborate with to gain more exposure about the food that he/she is going to sell which, in turn, gain customers for his/her new food business.", "Similarly, existing business owners can view potentially trending food, but they filter it based on cuisines. This is because we recognise that it would be impractical for existing business owners to sell potentially popular food which is not in their domain. In the case when the existing business owner sells both Malay and Indian cuisine, he/she can select the cuisines via the dropdown menu. From there, he/she can find out the number of posts that influencers posted based on the cuisines selected, as well as other metrics including number of followers, likes, comments, and sentiment score. Thus, the existing business owner knows which influencer to collaborate with to promote his/her business to attract his/her potential customers based on the reach of the influencers\u2019 posts.", "We are interested to find out about the network of food influencers and their followers. In order to do this, we prepared a csv file of the mapping between the food influencers and their followers. We then imported this file into Gephi and obtained a social network graph. However, due to the massive number of nodes, the social network graph was not clearly visible, so we filtered out some nodes. The nodes in the following graph represents the top 12 food influencers in Singapore and people who follow at least 7 of these influencers.", "The graph generated in Gephi is as follows:", "What is interesting is the fact that the influencers themselves are grouped into different communities and upon investigating, we found out the following insights.", "For the purple community, we found out that sheeatsshecooks posts a lot about raw meat as it partners with butcher @meatcosg. Perhaps her followers are interested in raw meat, but many people may not share this same interest. For the green community, the two are the least popular of all the top 12 food influencers. For the orange community, these influencers are different from the rest because they tend to post about light refreshments such as beverages and cakes instead of heavy meals. Lastly, the blue community is grouped together because they are popular and have many followers. Perhaps the followers like to follow popular foodies.", "From the graph, we can see that many followers follow multiple food influencers, which indicates that the food community is close-knit, and they are fans of food instead of the food influencers. This observation is unlike the K-pop fandom, whereby fans pledge their loyalty to a particular group at a time.", "Due to the closeness centrality of the network, food trends can easily spread from person to person. This close-knit community provides evidence that the food industry is a good industry for business owners to consider entering or developing in.", "This project was done as part of IS434 Social Analytics and Applications course at Singapore Management University.", "Your home for data science.
