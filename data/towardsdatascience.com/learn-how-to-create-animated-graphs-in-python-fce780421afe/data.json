Animated data visualisation takes things up a notch and adds a wow factor.", "In this blog, we are going to examine how you can animate your charts.

This blog will get you started, but the possibilities are endless.", "In typical fashion, as you\u2019ve come to expect from Python, there exists a very easy-to-use package that enables us to add an extra dimension to our data visualisation.", "The package in question is the FuncAnimation extension method and is part of the Animation class in Python\u2019s matplotlib library. We will look at multiple examples on how to use it, but for now, you can think of this function as a while loop which keeps redrawing our figure on the canvas.", "What helped me to understand how to animate graphs was to start from the end. The animation magic will happen from the following two lines:", "Let us look at the above inputs of FuncAnimation:", "For further optional inputs, check out the docs.", "Delving into the above a bit further, all one needs to do, is parameterise their graphs into a function which takes as an input the point in the time-series, and it\u2019s game on!", "To ensure we have all basis covered, we are going to build upon our previous examples of data visualisation, which we\u2019ve covered in:", "In other words, we are going to use data from the pandemic\u00a0(deaths\u00a0per\u00a0day), and we will use the final dataset given from the below code.

That is, create the figure object, the x and y labels, set the line colours and the figure margins.", "We then have to set up our curve function, and then animate it:", "The code structure looks identical to that of a line graph. There are, however, some differences which we will go through.", "One of the main differences is that in the above code, we return a single set of values each time. In the line plot, we were returning the whole time-series up to the point we were at. We achieve that through the use of", "df1.head(i) returns a time-series, but the .max() ensures that we only get the latest records (because the total number of deaths would either remain the same or go up).", "Building a bar chart is just as easy as the examples we\u2019ve seen so far. For this example, I have included both a horizontal and a vertical bar chart.
