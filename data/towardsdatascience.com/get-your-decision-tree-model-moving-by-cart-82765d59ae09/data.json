In my previous articles, I have introduced the ID3 and C4.5 algorithms for constructing Decision Tree models.", "In this article, I\u2019ll introduce one more algorithm called CART for building a Decision Tree model, which is also probably the most commonly used. BTW, it is the default algorithm when you using Scikit-Learn library for a Decision Tree Classifier.", "CART Algorithm is an abbreviation of Classification And Regression Trees. It was invented by Breiman et al. in 1984 [1].", "It is generally very similar to C4.5, but have the following major characteristics:", "This article will focus on CART as a Classification Tree.", "Just like the ID3 and C4.5 algorithms that rely on Information Gain as the criterion to split nodes, the CART algorithm makes use another criterion called Gini to split the nodes.", "If you have ever learned economics, you must be familiar with the Gini Index, which indicates the income inequality or wealth inequality within a nation or any other group of people [2].", "In CART algorithm it is intuitively using the Gini coefficient for a similar purpose. That is, the larger Gini coefficient means the larger impurity of the node. Similar to ID3 and C4.5 using Information Gain to select the node with more uncertainty, the Gini coefficient will guide the CART algorithm to find the node with larger uncertainty (i.e. impurity) and then split it.", "The formula of the Gini coefficient is relatively simpler than the Information Gain and Information Gain Ratio that we\u2019ve used in the other two Decision Tree algorithm. It is shown as follows.", "Don\u2019t be scared by the formula. Let\u2019s take an example to demonstrate it. I promise it is not difficult to understand.", "The example below has been used in all the other articles that I have written about Decision Tree.", "Suppose we want to start the Decision Tree by splitting using the \u201cWeather\u201d feature. Then, we need to calculate the Gini coefficients for its conditions. Let\u2019s focus on the weather attribute and the results, which is shown in the tables below.", "It is quite easy to calculate the probability p(Ck|t). For example, if we consider the attribute \u201cweather = sunny\u201d, it has 1 \u201cyes\u201d and 2 \u201cno\u201d out of 3 samples totally. Therefore, the probability of the category \u201cyes\u201d is 1/3, and it is 2/3 for the category \u201cno\u201d. We can then easily calculate the Gini coefficient for all of them as follows.", "The intuition we got from the above 3 equation is that", "The numbers reflected our intuition as well. The Gini coefficient is 0.444 when the weather is sunny because it is impure. When the weather is cloudy or rainy, the Gini coefficient is 0. So, it does not make any sense to split the node using the attributes \u201cweather = cloudy\u201d and \u201cweather = rainy\u201d, because we know that the decision must be all yes or all no.", "How can we decide the root node and consequently using the same logic to decide how to split the internal nodes? It is as easy as using the weighted sum of the Gini coefficients from all the possible sub-nodes.", "Since CART algorithm is the CART algorithm makes use a binary tree, each time we need to calculate the weighted sum of the Gini coefficients for two nodes only. The formula is as follows.", "Again, don\u2019t be scared by the formula. Let\u2019s use the same example, weather feature.", "If we use weather as the root node, there are 3 different scenarios:", "The same logic will be applied to all the other possibilities until we found the maximum Gini coefficient, and that will be the root node. Similarly, for the internal nodes, the same logic is applied to make sure every split have a maximum Gini coefficient.", "In this article, I have introduced another Decision Tree algorithm called CART (Classification And Regression Tree). It constructs binary trees which have only two branches. It also supports continuous numeric values as a target. The most significant characteristic of CART is that it uses the Gini coefficient as the criterion to split the nodes.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
