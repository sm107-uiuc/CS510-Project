We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "On Sunday night, president Trump tweeted that he didn\u2019t want the cure for COVID-19 to be worse than the problem itself. Others, including very serious people like Elon Musk and Andrew Yang, have said that the economic damage of confronting the virus outweighs the deaths it would cause if we chose to do nothing or a weak response. Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick put it more starkly, saying that he thinks a lot of grandparents would be willing to die to save the economy for their grandchildren.", "There are two ways to interpret this kind of thinking. One is that people don\u2019t believe public health experts who state that the coronavirus is ten times more deadly than the seasonal flu, which kills 30\u201340 thousand people a year in the U.S. even with a vaccine (a coronavirus vaccine likely won\u2019t be ready until next year). Another explanation is that the lives of older Americans aren\u2019t being valued appropriately, which is more likely than experts\u2019 estimates of the virus\u2019 danger being incorrect.", "How can one compare the value of these lives to the costs of trying to save them? One may feel that a life is priceless but organizations like insurance companies and government agencies put a price tag on human life in order to weigh different policy decisions. In 2020 dollars, the EPA values a single human life at $10.5 million. This is higher than other approaches to estimating life-value, say by using the value of one\u2019s lifetime earnings ($2.8 million in 2020 dollars). But it captures the intuition that people have value outside of their economic contributions.", "Using the EPA\u2019s life value along with several other metrics, one can compare the costs of different policy choices. We have estimates of how fatal the virus is by age group and we know how many people are in each age group. We also have a sense of the proportion of coronavirus cases that end up in severe or critical condition, along with how much each type of case would likely cost. Last, researchers have estimated how deadly the virus would be given various assumptions about people\u2019s behavior.", "Without policy responses and little to no behavioral responses, early worst case scenarios estimated that the coronavirus would cause 1.7\u20132.2 million deaths in the U.S. However, such a catastrophe is unlikely to occur in reality. Even if the government did nothing in response to such a pandemic, people would change their habits and many other institutions like businesses and schools would change their behaviors to slow the virus\u2019 spread. More likely scenarios put death estimates between 200\u2013480 thousand, with a midpoint of 340 thousand being in line with ten times the annual deaths caused by the seasonal flu.", "The table below shows the results of putting all these numbers together. It\u2019s hard to tell which scenario current policy would fall under. While it\u2019s unlikely that we are going to see the worst case scenario estimates given actions to-date, it\u2019s clear based on the data shown in Figure 1 that the U.S. response looks far more like Italy than China or South Korea. My assumption is that current policy is in line with the more-likely estimates of 200\u2013480 thousand deaths.", "The more likely scenarios show a direct cost of -1.2 to -2.8% of GDP. This includes the cost of hospitalizing 1.6 million or more severe or critical cases along with life-value lost. It doesn\u2019t include the impacts of not being able to treat people as a result of concentrating resources towards coronavirus (which would be higher in the worst case scenarios). These numbers also don\u2019t include the follow-on effects on the economy.", "Goldman Sachs estimates that the economy will shrink by 3.8% percent in 2020 as a result of the public health situation. But the total impact isn\u2019t just that -3.8%, it\u2019s how this growth differs from what would have happened without the coronavirus. Average economic growth over the past five years is 2.3% but markets expected a recession before the virus struck. My approach uses a value between average growth and the 0.3% average from 1990, 2001, and 2009, which comes out to 1.3%. Overall, the economic effects of the virus are -5.1% of GDP (-3.8% -1.3%).", "This number should be combined with the direct costs of the more likely scenarios in order to compute the overall cost of our current policy, which comes out to -6.3 to -7.9% of GDP. This cost pales in comparison to the worst case scenarios. The direct cost (not including the state of the economy) of doing nothing is estimated at -9.8 to -12.7% of GDP, far higher than the current policy.", "However, it is wrong to say that doing nothing would mean that the economy would have just continued along the same growth path. The worst case scenarios show that 13.7\u201317.8 million people would be hospitalized with severe or critical cases. With such extraordinary impacts on people, at some point even the Florida spring break kids would stop going outside once they started getting seriously chided for endangering their parents and grandparents. Institutions outside of the federal government would enact policies to keep people safe. Combined, these actions would have slowed the economy.", "Even if the U.S. chose to do nothing in order to stave off a recession, other countries still would have shut down much of their economic activity, and this would have slowed the overall global economy, reducing U.S. growth. My assumption here is that the effect on the U.S. economy would have been half as bad (-2.6% instead of -5.1%) in the worst case scenario, leading to overall costs of -12.4 to 15.2% of GDP, far higher than the cost of the lackluster response the U.S. has employed to-date.", "What if one values life differently or thinks the economy would have been better in the worst case scenario? Anyone can download the spreadsheet model here and play with the inputs to see the impacts. The results are robust to many reasonable choices of assumptions on worst-case economic growth and life-value.", "Early feedback on this article rightly points out that the fiscal stimulus packages currently being debated in Congress(~$2 trillion) have a price tag that is higher than current policy (7.1% of GDP, or roughly $1.5 trillion). However, fiscal stimulus packages are designed to bring an economy back to life, with the goal being that the economy grows faster than it would have without stimulus.", "This means that the net cost of stimulus is lower than its initial price tag. For instance, TARP was a $700 million program (roughly $400 million was actually invested) designed to help after the 2008 financial crisis and it ended up making a profit. It\u2019s hard to say what the final cost of this stimulus will be but it\u2019s worth pointing out that the 2017 Trump tax cuts reduced government revenues by roughly $500 billion dollars in 2018 alone. Going back to Obama-era levels of revenue after this crisis would help foot the bill for current stimulus.", "The fact is that there was never really an option to do nothing. It\u2019s a good thing that states have ordered people to shelter in place, and not just because of the value of the lives saved. The utilitarian calculations above miss the value of treating people with dignity and respect. Such respect contributes to a cohesive society and supports individual rights.", "The question going forward is, will the Trump administration and state/local governments stay the course? My biggest concern is that people will become so worried about the economy that they relax restrictions and their own personal safety measures, which would lead to a resurgence in virus transmission as seen in Taiwan. Given the economic damage to-date and many people\u2019s fear of spreading the virus, it\u2019s unlikely that an ease of restrictions would bring the economy roaring back to life.", "Data repository and scripts can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
