Luca urges the reader to have an open mind when digesting the contents presented in the article. But after reading, I will argue that you don\u2019t necessarily need an open mind to be able to fathom the reality of the technologies Luca presents.", "Luca correlates the similarities between far fetched presumptions of the future to current-day technologies that are available to us in a manner that made me think that yes all these future technologies are only a couple of generations away.", "This article is an excellent read if you would like to find out why only poor people will die in the future, or why a future society could be populated with \u2018perfect\u2019 humans.", "Luca discusses the fears associated with each of the mentioned future technology. Each section also includes a segment that rationalizes the fear humans may have on the incoming and unpreventable future.", "The article is riddled with resources that provide evidence of organization alluding to the path of creating the mentioned future tech. So, for the sceptical readers that feel we might be hundreds of years away from some of the mentioned future technology, Luca\u2019s article might change your mind.", "Binh Phan provides information on how Machine learning practitioners can extend the reach of their machine learning models online, at relatively no cost at all.

But nevertheless, it\u2019s always good to get an understanding of what the end goal of your studies could look like, as this can make your learning path much more transparent.", "Adam Tabriz, MD article combines the world of Artificial intelligence and Healthcare, through the portrayal of how AI will impact the day to day roles and services delivered by various healthcare practices.", "The non-technical approach of the article makes this a great read for all readers.", "Adam starts with a deep dive of the term deep learning and the connotations that come with it.
