Almeida (talmeida ufscar.br) Department of Computer Science Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar) Sorocaba, Sao Paulo \u2014 Brazil and taken from UCI Machine Learning [15].", "The collection is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by the raw message.", "The data set has 5 columns and 5572 rows. Out of these 5572 data points, type of 747 is labeled as spam and 4825 as \u2018ham\u2019 and contain 3 extra column as Unnamed:2/3/4 which is redundant. If the type has value ham, it means the text or message is not spam but if the value of type is spam then it means the text is spam and text are not in a chronological order.", "Looking at the original dataset it is clear that to develop high accuracy model, some preprocessing should be done.", "We will work this on Jupyter notebook and I assume that you have basic understanding of working with Jupyter notebook. If not, please check my previous blog where I have shared the beginners guide regarding setup and Exploratory Data Analysis.", "The dataset had already been pre-processed and well labeled. However, while studying the data the project found that the data could be further cleaned. we opted to omit the columns Unnamed:2, Unnamed:3, Unnamed:4 as they do not contain any value and will be only noise to the model.", "On this blog I will highlights the finding and explain essential topic and will not explain each and every line of code.", "You can explore code detail on GitHub.", "As the classification algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the classification task. There are actually many methods to convert a corpus to a vector format. The simplest is the bag-of-words approach. Bag-of-words is one of the most popular representation methods for object categorization. The key idea is to quantize each extracted key point into one of visual words, and then represent each image by a histogram of the visual words.[16]. i.e.For each unique word in a text will be represented by one corresponding number. To implement Bag-of -words, the project needs to remove very common words like (\u2018the\u2019, \u2018a\u2019, etc..). and split the text into individual words by using the tokenization concept.", "Process of converting or breaking up the string into words and punctuation[17] i.e the normal text strings into a list of tokens also called lemmas.", "After having each words split, there is need to convert each of those token(lemmas) into a vector that SciKit Learns algorithm models can work with using bag-of-words model. For this the project followed two steps using the bag-of-words model:", "1. Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency) by CountVectorizer.", "2. Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency) and term weighting and normalization was done with TF-IDF.", "This model will convert a collection of text documents to a 2-D matrix of token counts. Where the 1-dimension is the entire vocabulary (1 row per word) and the other dimension are the actual documents, in this case a column per text message", "TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the TF-IDF weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining two prime concern.", "1. Used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection", "2. Importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears", "Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document i.e. it measures how frequently a term occurs in a document", "Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears i.e. it measures how important a term is[13].", "While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \u201cis\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, and \u201cthat\u201d, may appear a lot of times but have little importance.", "On the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) cycle we see the length character, distribution of digtis and non digits and also ploted tha top 30 words of spam and ham words.", "After preprocessing, vectorization and gaining some insights from EDA, the project goes for training a model and work with seven different classification algorithm.", "As from part 1 of the blog, we having the basic understanding of algorithms and on working with them on our notebook here are the accuracy obtained from each algorithms.", "Using seven algorithms, the project found Na\u00efve Bayes classification outperform all, Thus the project used Na\u00efve Bayes classification which is validated with simplicity and high accuracy[14].", "In the next blog part, We will jump into the Na\u00efve Bayes behind the Spam or Ham classifier and look into python flask code for spam or ham detector.", "Directly want to play with code, then please check GitHub.", "If you have any queries regarding the article or want to work together on your next data science project, ping me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
