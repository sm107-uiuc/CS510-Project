This need is even more acute if we factor-in that the pandemic is rapidly leading to re-shoring of manufacturing in both US and Europe. And solid academic research has cleared AI and Robotics from charges of being the cause of US job losses: q recent study by MIT researcher David Autor concludes how we have vastly overestimated job losses from productivity growth due to automation. Rather, the real culprit is the introduction of low-cost labor countries such as China into the global trading system. To the contrary, studies have shown that by coupling workers with AI factories can boost product defect detection and quality assurance, increasing productivity by 50 percent or more without the need to replace humans.", "The continuing shortage of skilled labor in these countries, which has seen manufacturing disappear in the past decades in favor of Asia, is decreasing reliance on hard-to-find human experts, driving adoption of worker-augmented technologies and ultimately decreasing costs.", "With a global industrial robotics market size projected to reach USD 73.0 billion by 2025, the indication is that manufacturers are focused on the right technologies.", "While \u201clights-out manufacturing\u201d \u2014 fully automated facilities that can operate entirely without human intervention \u2014 is out in the future for many, the industry needs solution now and steps must be taken to reduce physical distance/presence as soon as possible.", "AI, with the ability to substitute human eyes in tasks that would normally require multiple people to perform, is the low hanging \u2018technology fruit\u2019 that can be put to work immediately. Unlike robotics and complex Industry 4.0 IoT infrastructures, AI can be as simple as a software upgrade on existing machines, lowering the time and cost barrier to adopt in many manufacturing contexts.", "One good step breeds another one.
