To be prepared, please download freesurfer, docker, and python.", "I chose to examine resting-state networks among schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compare them to these healthy people.", "I am curious whether schizophrenia displays functional differences, and mainly whether such differences could be found in the resting-state network.", "I believe this is an interesting question (and a good case-study for a tutorial about fMRI analysis) since it offers an insight into functional connectivity analysis via the exploration of a disorder known to be associated with abnormal neural circuitry (Yu et al., 2012).", "No, this section does not concern with the operation of MRI machines, but rather it focuses on various online resources offering existing scans for public use. Among them, openfMRI, Oasis, openNeuro, and 1000 Functional Connectomes project.", "Most datasets present raw, de-identified, data \u2014 while some include some preprocessing scripts. A useful dataset will be organized following some standard; a common one is the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. In a BIDS formatted dataset, you can expect to see the files organized in a hierarchy: first the subjects id, then the type of scan, and later (if applicable) different tasks or runs relevant for every kind of scan. The files themselves are most likely to be NIFTI files (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) or compressed NIFTI files (.nii or .nii.gz).", "I use this dataset from openneuro. It comprises scans of 290 individuals diagnosed with various physio-psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, ADHD, depressive disorder, PTSD, and more) as well as healthy controls. Additional to the variety of conditions, this dataset includes several types of scans capturing different tasks. To explore the research question posed above, I chose to focus on the resting-state fMRI scans of SZ patients.", "fMRI data were acquired 3T Siemens Trio scanners. Scan parameters are as follows- slice thickness=4 mm, 34 slices, TR=2 s, TE=30 ms, flip angle=90\u00b0, matrix 64\u00d764, FOV=192 mm, oblique slice orientation. During resting-state scans, participants were asked to remain relaxed and keep their eyes open; they have not been presented any stimuli or asked to respond during the scan (Poldrack, 2016A).", "From the dataset description, we can see that the T1w (anatomical) scans have been defaced (anonymized via facial features removal) using freesurfer mri_deface. Defaced data, by definition, underwent some preprocessing before. Ideally, working with raw data ensures more uniform preprocessing, but if that is not the case, it is essential to know which steps have been taken already.", "Since this post focuses on data preparation, I demonstrate the tutorial using a subset of the data. One SZ (sub-50006) and one control (sub-10228) subjects.The data directory (organized according to BIDS) should look like that:", "directories, this includes the dataset description, a table with subject demographic information, and a task description file.", "Let\u2019s have a look at our data.", "NIFTI images contain a header that can nicely provide you with a lot of the metadata about the image. This information will become handy when we need to correct the image for noise and other distortions. (more details here)", "We can also find the number of slices (dim of the Z-axis) and the TR for the scan via the metadata. TR: 2.0 and the # of slices: 34. (hooray, these numbers seem to match those reported by the authors).", "Additionally, we can easily visualize them using freesurfer. Inspecting the image allows us to identify obvious problems with the scan (weird orientation, artifacts, poor contrast, or even the lack of image all together). There are tools allowing to perform such quality control automatically (we will discuss them soon).", "Before running the preprocessing pipeline, let\u2019s have a look at the quality of the data in hand. Quality control (QC) helps detect images that suffer severe problems- such as artifacts or heavy distortion.", "QC for data used to analyze large-scale networks focuses particularly on temporal consistency. Power et al. (2011) detail several image quality metrics (IQM) focused on identifying non-spurious correlations. I use a software named mriQC, since it presents IQMs following peer-reviewed publications (among them power et al., 2011; Kr\u00fcger et al., 2011). The list below describes the IQMs relevant to ensuring temporal consistency and avoiding spurious correlations. Images containing bad artifacts or very low SNRs would be excluded while the rest enter the preprocessing pipeline. DVARS and FD will be used during preprocessing to form a temporal mask (i.e. highlight specific slices to be removed).", "This command runs the QC for all participants in your data directory- this is a long and heavy calculation. Please make sure to allocate sufficient resources (or run in one by one).", "Before looking at the metrics, I take a look at the structural visual report. The key takeaway from the report is the defacing process (seen here as a yellow mark over the BOLD noise visualization).", "The functional report reports DVARS, FD, and an outliers measurement over time. These graphs indicate that sub-10228 provides a much cleaner scan than sub-50006.", "The group functional report reveals high values for both tSNR and SNR.", "After inspecting the data and making sure we are happy with its quality, let us perform preprocessing.", "I use fMRIPrep, since it attempts to provide a standardized preprocessing pipeline and to address the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep is an analysis-agnostic tool that offers a flexible, minimal, and robust pipeline for fMRI Data. Additionally, it is easy to use, open-source software that keeps a transparent discussion about their limitations and development.", "Pay attention to the flags I used- \u2018- -fs-license-file\u2019 indicates to fMRIPrep where is your freesurfer license file, \u2018- -fs-no-reconall\u2019 skips freesurfer reconstruction step (it is somewhat buggy and not essential here), and \u2018- -output-spaces\u2019 defines the anatomical spaces from which to resample the data (T1w refers back to the image itself, fsaverage5 refers to freesurfers template and template refers to the MNI map).", "Similarly, this command runs fMRIPrep for all participants in your data directory. Be aware. fMRIPrep is heavy. More info here.", "fMRIPrep uses both structural and functional images in its pipeline. It outputs the images post head-motion correction, slice-timing correction, and aligned into the same-subject\u2019s structural space and in accordance with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. MNI is a standardized space allowing normalize different brains into a single, comparable map.", "fMRIPrep pipeline in a nutshell. For more info please visit the documentation.", "The order of these steps supports a more robust correction (Power et al., 2012).", "Compare the DVARS, FD, and outliers measurements of the raw data and the preprocessed one, we see that the preprocessing reduced the noise in the data.", "Once the data is clean, denoised, and preprocessed- we can (finally) identify connectivity features. Remember, resting-state networks exhibit correlated temporal patterns across spatially independent regions (Jandric et al., 2018). Two common ways to examine such correlation patterns are via seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). SCA (Biswal et al., 1995) is a model-based method; thus, it requires an a-priori division of the brain into regions of interests (ROIs) (Lee et al., 2013). SCA is especially useful since it is effortless to implement and straightforward to interpret (Soares et al., 2016). Basically, it uses the time series of an a-priori selected seed region to identify whole-brain functional connectivity maps (based on the specified ROIs). ICA, on the other hand, is a model-free method and decomposes data from the whole brain into the time courses and spatial maps of recognized signals. These signals, the independent components, are a collection of regions that exhibits maximal spatial independence but co-varying temporally (Cole et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013).", "Nilearn is a python library that supports both these (and many other) neuroimaging analysis methods.", "First, we need to upload the preprocessed images:", "These tools are the ones we need in order to get an atlas of regions and produce a correlation matrix. As discussed above, in SCA- we use an a-priori atlas and in ICA- we create one based on the dataset.", "The first function creates a masker. I like the Nilearn definition of a masker. They as us to \u201cthink of masker objects as swiss-army knives for shaping the raw neuroimaging data in 3D space into the units of observation relevant for the research questions at hand\u201d. The masker will filter in only the parts of the data we are interested in. The masker uses the atlas to transform the fMRI scan.", "Actually this is it. A transformed fMRI scan reflects a 2D matrix of regions to time steps (i.e. a [10,160] would reflect the values of ten regions across 160 time-steps).", "But to have a nice, simple, visualization- we calculate the correlation matrix of the extracted regions and plot it (second and third functions).", "The Harvard-Oxford Atlas is based on MNI defined regions thus demonstrates a well known a-priori segmentation of the brain to regions. On the other hand, the Smith\u2019s atlas reflects regions resulting from an independent analysis of resting-state fMRIs and their demonstrated activation brain dynamics. Thus it is somewhat in between an SCA to an ICA. It does present a mask independent of the current data, but its origins are in an ICA of a similar dataset.", "We use both these atlases to create maskers based on their extracted regions. Calculate their corresponding correlation matrixes and plot.", "In ICA, we are not importing atlases but calculating them using the dataset itself.", "Once the regions are generated, the process is as we did with the SCA. We create a mask and calculate the correlations.", "In the next part of this tutorial \u2014 How do we use these data in statistical analysis. Are there differences in the resting-state networks between SZ subjects to the controls?", "As a little teaser, this figure shows the correlation matrix of one SZ patient. Can you spot any obvious differences?", "Cole, D. M., Smith, S. M., & Beckmann, C. F. (2010). Advances and pitfalls in the analysis and interpretation of resting-state FMRI data.
