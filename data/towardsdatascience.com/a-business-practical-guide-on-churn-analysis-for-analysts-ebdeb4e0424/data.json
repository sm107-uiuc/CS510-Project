To minimize this, we analyze churn. When I started learning about churn analysis I took to Medium and Kaggle. Having read many of the articles and notebooks out there I came to a few conclusions that motivated me to write this article. Most works are either:", "o Too Technical: Lots of code, little reasoning. We work with data that is a depiction of reality yet many articles lack communication.", "o Too Theoretical: Lots of reasons why you should do a churn analysis, perhaps some math, lack of clear examples. Often following the hype.", "o Too Specific: Business is practical, most articles dive too deep in the latter two parts to be of significant value to business. Analysts deliver value through actionable insights. How to get such insights in general?", "And well, some works are just too dull! So, I\u2019ll be wrapping our analysis in the world of dating. After all, we don\u2019t want Jack to be alone forever :)", "As such, this article will take you through the steps on how to conduct a churn analysis, I promise you that there will be code and that I will make it clear. This article is summarized in the Venn diagram below, topped with a dating sauce:", "Because when we focus too little on theory, we can overlook the scientific process which makes it harder to prove our conclusions.", "When we focus too little on the technical part, we miss the skills and experience necessary to conduct our work.", "When we focus too little on the practical aspect, we overlook the necessity and value of our work towards business.", "So striking a balance is key and although we need to focus at times on just one of the three, we should never lose a single one out of our sight!", "With that said, let\u2019s go through the process!", "1) Should we conduct a churn analysis? Practical focus at the start", "Let\u2019s start practical. Before starting the analysis, consider the effort versus its value. You will have to get data, process it, and make it presentable in a way that it is understood and useful. Although assessing value early-on can be hard, nobody wants their work to go unnoticed. To answer this question, you need to understand the following:", "When to conduct a churn analysis?", "We conduct a churn analysis to estimate why people have left and to predict which ones will likely leave, all with the goal to prevent it. When is this analysis a priority? Have a look at some trigger events, or reasons to conduct a churn analysis, in the right order:", "Right, this means that if you did a churn analysis in the past, and that when there\u2019s not a good reason to improve or extend the prior analysis, that you shouldn\u2019t spend your time on churn! ..And more likely on acquisition or assisting current business.", "Regarding 1, what is meant with data for a good analysis? It refers to analyses made on data that meet the basic requirements for any analysis.", "I\u2019m getting all these mixed signals, what does she mean?! \u2014 Jack at a nightclub", "2) How to conduct a churn analysis? Theoretical focus to shape ideas", "We are going to do the analysis, hooray! So, how do we go about it? First, we look at the problem statement, as the first step in the scientific process. Combine this with the business value of our project \u2014 a requirement in the project selection process \u2014 and you are practically setting yourself up for success.", "Thus, what is the business value of this project? Well, churn is about customers leaving, which means a reduction in revenue. Yet customers will always leave, that is normal, so churn itself is more a fact of life than it is a problem. It however becomes a problem if it is too large. In that sense, the value of a churn analysis is the prevention of losing too much revenue.", "What is too much? If this is your first churn analysis, then we can say that the churn rate is definitely too high when it matches, or is higher than, the acquisition rate. If this is a continued analysis or if your business has the goal to set its churn KPI to no more than 10%, than go with that. The key is that you need to define your problem in a way that it is measurable, for instance:", "Example problem statement:  \u201cOur average churn rate within a [time period].... is greater or equal to the retention rate\u201d or \u201c..above our goal of 10%\u201d", "In the parts below we will handle the theoretical steps, afterwards we apply the steps.", "To know how to solve the problem, you need to know about the nature of the problem and although churn seems like a simple metric at first sight, it can be defined uniquely for each business. As such, defining churn is a topic that can fill an article by itself. Although I will not dive into that here, please know that there are roughly two types of churn: Contractual and non-contractual. The difference is that contractual churn is fixed by contracts. The customer discontinues the service by explicitly not renewing the contract. With non-contractual churn, the event is not explicitly observed. This means that the two types each has its own problem to solve.", "Most analysts that perform a churn analysis will work on contractual churn simply due to the complex nature of defining non-contractual churn. If you do want to read about an analysis on the latter, learn more from this article here.", "Next, understand that churn is the result of a decision-making process, one where all the elements that matter to us come together. We can arrange these elements into a model. With a model, we can show and replicate the process.", "Step 3: Creating a mental model", "We defined and understand the problem, now we think about the elements related to it. What relates to churn? which ones influence it? Brainstorm for those items on what churn means for different people and write them down.", "We start general, such as what do people want versus what do you offer? Then imagine a fit score as the outcome. For telecom, it could be as follows:", "Or if we use the dating analogy:", "We could then simply hold the items versus the people to obtain scores:", "Did you notice how I categorized the different product items as variables into color groups? Jack is looking for someone with personality, a knowledgeable mind and a physique that\u2019s attractive to him. Most people look for the same, so our categories are general enough to use for a wider variety of people.", "We can use these categories to create a simple mental model as a linear equation, where each person appoints a number to how important they find personality, knowledge and physique, multiplied versus Jack\u2019s profile. We compute and then sum it all up to get a fit score:", "If we would now put a lot of data through this model, we could assess the fit between Jack and his dates. But is this a good model..? Are the scores useful to him? Do I now know who Jack is looking for? No! Dating is subtle and this is too general to be of use. Sorry Jack! Although we aim to be practical, how can we make a good-performing model that we all can understand and use?", "Step 4: Understanding relationships (between variables)", "First, we need to look at our variables and their relationship to churn. If variable X changes, what is its impact on Y? Is there a direct causal relationship, or is it more like correlation? We\u2019re entering the realm of hypothesis development, useful for creating a good mental model.", "Yet, do we need to understand how everything exactly relates to one another? Again think practical. We only need the knowledge of how things more or less connect to one another. Therefore we do not need to go into tests or acquire deep knowledge. For instance, if you like someone, you just like someone. How you feel is then related to how you are with that person. Simple as that.", "Don\u2019t overthink Jack! You know how it works. Take a shot and get over there!", "To best explain how this works, I will be using data and coding from here on. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m making it as simple as possible so everyone understands. People like your manager, other colleagues and maybe your next date!", "3) Conducting a first analysis: Technical focus to do the job", "I will be using a commonly used dataset on churn, the Telco Telecom Churn Dataset. As with any data an analyst gets, we start with asking:", "Step 1: What data do we have?The Telco customer churn dataset is about a fictive telecom company providing home phone and internet subscriptions. The data covers 7043 customers in California in Q3, featuring 21 different variables, including churn labels. Avoid a first mistake here and read the variable definitions. If you do not have definitions of what you are looking at, acquire them. Next, check the data.", "I tabled the output and the definitions together for sake of brevity & clarity:", "Alright, all columns include 7043 entries. So, no empty entries. We have 18 columns with text (object) data and three numeric (int and float) columns.", "We checked our data and noticed some inconsistencies to fix.Things to fix are:customerID, tenure and gender \u2192 Names need to be capitalized like the restTotalCharges \u2192 A currency number stored as textSeniorCitizen \u2192 Yes and no as 1 and 0, use text for business interpretation", "As a result of correcting the formatting, we found 11 missing values in TotalCharges and deleted the entries. The reason is that we set out to be practical: Effort versus value. To attain complete data, losing 11 entries is negligible.", "Don\u2019t sweat the details Jack, move on.", "Step 2: Connecting the data with the problem", "Do we now jump towards machine learning? na-ah. Still too early! We have to now think about how our data connects to the problem. We look at what we care about, churn, with a simple uni-variate analysis. Because we may think we understand our problem, churn, but does our data resemble those ideas too? We confirm whether churn is a problem before starting this analysis.", "Alright, so about a quarter of the customers churned by the end of Q3. Is this high? Well, how many customers have a tenure of 3 or less months in Q3?", "Kay, so more customers are churning than being acquired over the same period. So, doing this analysis make sense to support the business!", "Also note that if we would talk about balance, churners seem under-represented in the dataset. About 27% churned, not 50%. Good to know for further analysis! Because even if it is better for business to have less churners, what would happen if we use machine learning now.. Who will it learn most about? Exactly, the 73% non-churners! We want to know about churners, and what it is that separates them from non-churners. As such we have our first learning: We need to later resolve the imbalance for more in-depth analysis.", "You see Jack, if you want to be better at dates, you just need to have more dates", "This means Jack will also have to encounter more rejections in order to learn further. Poor Jack. Luckily for us, we can artificially create more churners. The way we go about that is by oversampling (creating more of) them. We\u2019ll do this at a later stage when the business demands it, right now we learn more from our natural sample :). Best conclusion so far: Our churn rate of 27% is greater than the acquisition rate and poses a business problem.", "Step 3: Creating a mental model (with data)", "Remember how our mental model consisted of a lot of different items? Some where about the market and the customers within it, some where about the product and the specifications of it. We brainstormed and derived items related to churn. Such as internet speed when looking at internet.. well we have data on whether a customer chose cable or the faster fiber internet.", "As such, we connect theory to data. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t ever have all the data necessary to connect all our initial ideas, yet our brainstorm does yield us that broader perspective, one that we would have missed, had we immediately jumped to the data. Highly important.", "Now moving on to our variables towards churn, to get a rough understanding of how they relate, we run bi-variate analyses. Meaning that we compare each variable we have versus our churn variable.", "Having looked at our variables more closely, contextually, we can tell that some of the columns are about add-ons related to having subscribed to an internet service or phone service. It is wise to group them, similar to the groups we had earlier.", "About the data, most of our categorical data contains either a yes or a no and sometimes a third option about whether the customer has the main service.", "For example, there is \u201cno internet service\u201d as a third option for the internet add-on variables. It seems a bit of a weird as an answer to a yes or no question. Two reasons why we need to avoid a mistake here:", "The proper way to deal with this is to have a separate column about whether the main service was purchased or not and to limit the variable to two options. Next is to take care of the group sizes when visualizing the data. Let me visualize this:", "Now you may think, is this not obvious..? Well, I have seen this simple mistake occur in quite some notebooks and also medium articles, making the case to mention this. Right, time to look at all our categorical variables together!", "What is nice about this visual it that it shows the size of each group next to the amount of churners within it. We thereby avoid bias due to group size.", "We learn a few things here! The groups that have churned considerably more than their counterparts are seniors, people without a partner, those with fiber optic internet, those without internet security; an online backup or premium tech support, customers with a monthly contract and lastly those who pay their electric check automatically. Nice!", "What does all this mean for dating though? I mean, Jack seems a bit short on data. Well, Jack recently had a great date and some advice for him to tap into is, not all romantic ideas apply to all situations\u2026", "Well\u2026 Jack, had an amazing time and that\u2019s what matters! As you see, Jack may not have the most \u2018date-a\u2019 to go on and yet he\u2019s out there! As he looks back at the meals had, he wondered: What food would contribute most to the date being a success? As he plots food ranks versus a follow-up date, we can follow his example when looking at our own numerical data:", "Well well well, what do we have here! It seems that churn rate decreases as Tenure increases, so we\u2019re interested in customers that are relatively new to the business! This is also reflected by higher churn in lower TotalCharges. Furthermore, MonthlyCharges shows most customers seem to be paying around 20 bucks per month and that churn is relatively higher when it\u2019s 70 or more a month. Although our scatter plots could be better, as we see that binning the results really improves our analysis, we found useful conclusions.", "Step 4: Understanding relationships (between variables, with data!)", "Onto relatedness, how do our variables interact with one another. For this we look at a correlation plot. Correlation plots and also our eventual machine learning model will use numerical data. For that we want to format our categories into yes or no questions, where Yes\u2019s are 1 and No\u2019s are 0.", "Jack: So. We had a great date\u2026 and it got me thinking, is she\u2019s the 1 for me?", "We found something interesting again! Fiber optic is highly positively correlated with monthly charges. Perhaps fiber is overpriced? Because we saw a lot of churn within that group! This conclusion finds more support when we see its strong negative correlation with having no internet.", "Great so we have a general idea about our data now. Do we now proceed with our analysis? Nope. We\u2019ve scratched the surface yet learned a lot already.", "That is more than enough for now. Get your report ready and share your learnings with the organization! People may come up with interesting comments such as confirmation of prior hunches, doubt on the correctness of the data and other important things to communicate better earlier than later.", "Done with the report? Don\u2019t forget to communicate the next steps. Thereby helping your manager to make that practical decision to continue the analysis or not. If the practical necessity arises to dive deeper, we will further mix it with the theoretical and technical items of:", "Jack: I think I understand now, yesterday\u2019s date was a great success! I\u2019ll call her right now!", "Warner: No, no, no! Patience, Jack. She needs some time to process.", "Thanks for reading, please let me know what you think in the comments! And feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Want to know more still? Are you ready for the next steps?", "(Work in progress and open for ideas:) Click here for the next article that will handle how to get actionable insights from applying machine learning to your next churn analysis.", "Your home for data science.
