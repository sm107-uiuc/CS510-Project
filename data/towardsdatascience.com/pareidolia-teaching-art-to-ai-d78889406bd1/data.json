We start with a simple \u201clesson,\u201d and plan to gradually develop its content and complexity in an iterative process. The quality of the interactions and the respective outcomes will depend on both the technical capabilities of AI, as well as our own human ingenuity/limitations in communicating with it.", "Pareidolia is the tendency for incorrect perception of a stimulus as an object, pattern or meaning known to the observer, such as seeing shapes in clouds, seeing faces in inanimate objects or abstract patterns, or hearing hidden messages in music. Wikipedia", "In this project, our goal is to communicate to the AI that certain works of art are perception or interpretations of objects and ideas from the real world. As the first class of such objects, we chose the most human object out there \u2014 the human face.", "More specifically, we first start by showing the AI \u201creal\u201d human faces that are captured in photos. Next, we show it the artistic depiction of human faces as expressed in portrait paintings\u200a\u2014\u200aranging from realistic, all the way to abstract representation.", "We then probe the AI\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d: we show it new portrait paintings that it hasn\u2019t seen before, and ask it to generate a realistic photo that captures the essence of the face in that art piece (yes, the opposite direction). We were curious to see what it would produce. We have started with realistic paintings, but our intention is to further expand to abstract, cubist, surrealist, as well as 3D works. Finally, in true \u201cPareidolia\u201d fashion, we will give it photos of objects that are not human faces, and explore how it projects them as a realistic photo of a human face.", "We aim to explore the junction that doesn\u2019t only stretch the AI\u2019s capability of understanding and expressing art, but also our own human limitations in communicating our goals to the AI and collaborating with it.", "What makes teaching AI art magical, at this introductory level, is that there is no need to provide it with precise definitions and complex explanations of what a face is, what a portrait painting is, and how they relate to each other. Instead, we just give it (many) examples of both, and it somehow learns. Sounds exciting? Well, beware! All magic comes with a price.", "In our case, this price originates from the AI\u2019s lack of any prior knowledge about faces, portraits, or art. In fact, it lacks almost any prior knowledge about us, our histories, and our abortions. Nor of the world we live in. The only information it\u00a0has, is whatever is stored in the images\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0shown. Especially, it does not have access to the many concepts and facts we take for granted when WE look at portraits and photos.", "For example, the fact that faces are part of the human body, that there are certain universal commonalities such as the general shape of the head, the existence and positions of the eyes, ears, nose, and the mouth. The fact that humans come in different genders, races\u00a0, and ages, as well as in a spectrum of genetic variability\u200a\u2014\u200aand that all of these are visible attributes of the face. There are also more nuanced facts, like the variability of hair and facial hair, and facial expressions. Furthermore, the knowledge of what is the \u201cnatural\u201d orientation of a human face, and how does it look from above, or from the profile. It is this prior knowledge that allows us humans to effortlessly identify and analyse a human face, as well as to distinguish between a real face, and something that just looks like it.", "Similarly, there are concepts and facts relating to portraits. For example, the nuanced understanding that the portrait attempts to capture a face, but not necessarily in a direct and accurate manner, like a mirror does. Rather, there are built in constraints as well as intended adaptations\u200a\u2014\u200athe technique used, the artistic statement and agenda, the time and location of the\u00a0execution, and the composition and setup of the artwork.", "These are all pieces of knowledge we take for granted, and which are critical to the task of learning the relationship between photos and portraits. Pieces of knowledge to which the AI has no access.", "Admittedly, one could think of elaborate ways of communicating these to the AI. For example, provide labels for the images and portraits\u200a\u2014\u200aexplicitly detailing gender, race, age, expressions, and other facial attributes (bald, with beard, moustache, blonde hair, long nose, thick eyebrows, \u2026). However, we made a conscious decision not to use these, and see how far we can get with merely the unlabelled photos and portraits. We wanted to keep our dialogue with the AI simple.", "By now, the importance of the images we use as examples for training\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0obvious, as they encapsulate all the information the AI\u00a0has\u00a0access\u00a0to. Let\u2019s take a closer look at that then.", "In an ideal world, we would provide the AI with pairs of images: A photo of a person\u2019s face, and a matching portrait of that same person. Unfortunately, such datasets don\u2019t exist. Most of the portraits we have are from before the camera was invented, and most of the photos we have, are of people who didn\u2019t feel a need to get their portrait\u00a0painted.", "Moreover, the publicly available datasets of photos of human faces are often based on images of celebrities from across the web. These are heavily biased towards young, white, good-looking, fashionable, smiling faces, that are captured from an optimally aligned frontal position. This is in great contrast to the distribution of ages, expressions, positions, and textures that we find in portraits\u00a0(except\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0mostly\u00a0of\u00a0white\u00a0objects). This point is best illustrated by examples\u00a0:", "This seemingly simple difference introduces a HUGE challenge for our AI. Since the two datasets (photos vs portraits) actually represent two very different views of the human population. This indeed had very clear (and expected) affect on the learning, understanding, and output of the AI.", "Again, there are ways to try and address this issue. Ranging from using a more representative dataset of photos (easier said than done, and often on the expense of quality), all the way to creating \u201csynthetic portraits\u201d. That is, algorithmically manufacture \u201cartistic\u201d portraits from photos, and using these as pairs.", "However, as before, we decided to stick with simplicity at this stage, and not to use synthetic portraits.", "Now that we are finally done with this long introduction, let\u2019s have a look at our project, and what we actually produced.", "We thought it would be insightful and fun to reverse the artistic process, and have our outputs be synthesised \u201crealistic\u201d photos based on a portrait, rather than the other way around. Moreover, we didn\u2019t want the AI to \u201csimply\u201d apply a stylistics filter over the original portrait, and make it look more like a photo. Instead, we wanted to capture the semantics of the portrait, and recreate an \u201cartistic projection\u201d of it into what looks like a realistic photo.", "In order to achieve that, we set to train the AI to be able to separate the semantics of the photos and portraits from their style, and to map these semantics to a shared \u201cface\u201d space.", "We then probed how well the AI succeeded in this task, by requesting it to generate a new synthetic photo, based on a portrait it has never seen before.", "We thought this would be an insightful demonstration of \u201cunderstanding\u201d \u2014 both of the portrait, as well as of the human face.", "While, as noted above, we wanted to keep the inputs as simple and as authentic as possible, we still had to apply some simple modifications. Specifically, face cropping. As humans, we are naturally drawn to the face in a portrait. However, as can be seen below, in reality \u2014 the face occupies only a small portion of the portrait. The rest is filled with the body, the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and mostly \u2014 background. While we may not be bothered by it, it provides an abundance of distracting information for the AI that lacks any context and prior knowledge. So, in order to focus on what\u2019s important \u2014 we cropped the faces for both collections.", "Now that we had our input examples sorted, we had to choose the AI method that matched our goals.", "Since we didn\u2019t want to apply a \u201csimple\u201d filter, we decided not to go with a style transfer approach. Nor did we want to use a Machine Learning model that looks at the pixel level similarity between the source portrait and the target synthetic photo. So we looked for GAN models that operate on the semantics of the image (GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Networks \u2014 a machine learning technique that builds on ideas from game theory to generate outputs that match a desired criteria). Since we had the additional constraint of having two independent distributions (meaning, we didn\u2019t have pairs of photo-portrait to train on, but rather two separate collections), we experimented with different members of the broader Cycle-GAN family. We experimented with different options and modifications, and eventually landed on a slightly modified version of MUNIT (10 epochs * 100k iterations).", "Here are the results! These are 3 palettes, each containing 24 pairs (4 in each row x 6 rows). Each pair is made of the original portrait on the left, and the synthesised photo on the right.", "Some photos are surprisingly good, and some are awfully bad. One thing is clear: the AI is a victim of the bias we imposed on it through our \u201ccelebrity\u201d photo training set. In its universe of photos, people are 20\u201330 years old, looking straight at the camera, smiling, with perfect skin, and straight hair. Too old or too young, facial hair, curly hair, or slightly unexpected angles\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t pan out well. Still, it is thought provoking to consider this has been done with no context or explanations.", "Does the AI understand art? Ours definitely doesn\u2019t. Definitely not in the way humans do. However, what it produced is definitely interesting and encouraging. Some of the results seem to point at fundamental gaps in understanding, yet others are surprisingly good and exciting. Moreover, as we experimented with the project, we floated many ideas on how to make it even better. The key point though is whether this is a worthwhile journey. Can we learn new insights about our world, and about our perception of it through this dialogue \u2014 by trying to teach art to the AI? We plan to continue and explore this question.", "Enjoyed?
