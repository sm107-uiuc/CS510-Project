In our analysis, we focus on exploring travel patterns of New York City residents using 146+ million taxi trips taken for the year 2015. The complete code, visualizations & reports are available in the Github Repository", "GPS based transportation networks have been studied in detail for traffic flow analysis and determining social dynamics [1]. Bike sharing datasets have been used for clustering locations based on the usage profile[2] and predicting bike demand[3]GPS based taxi datasets have been used to identify mobility patterns in Shanghai, China [4].", "In[4], the trip distribution has been characterized as combination of 3 independent types and non-negative matrix factorization has been used to identify 3 patterns from 1.58 million trips in Shanghai, China. This is the core of our approach, as we are attempting to characterize taxi usage in New York City with a similar dataset. Prior analysis has also been done to produce transportation network graphs from street geometries[5]and subway maps[6].", "a) Raw data : New York city taxi & Limousine Commission has made the taxi trips dataset available for public use since 2009 onwards[7]. We used this dataset to perform our analysis. The complete dataset contains ~150 million trips for each year & each row represents one trip, with features for starting and stopping point, distance travelled, taxi-charge, time taken etc. We are using 2015 dataset which contains 146,112,990 trips in total. For combining the geolocation data to census tracts, we used the extremely helpful NYC land-use dataset [8].", "b) Data transformation : We use the following variables for each trip :", "Using these trips, we build our directed graph with start and stop location for a given trip as nodes. As an additional condition, we only used locations with high number trips (more than 500 in the year for a given pair of locations). From prior work we summarised that rounding off location coordinates to 2 decimal points is also an option and given our difficulties analysing the dataset with 40,000+ nodes, we are now in the process of reducing our network by 2 separate approaches:", "We create features for month, day, weekday, period of the day etc from the timestamp. An issue that we faced during our initial analysis was that \u2014 due to geography of the network itself, we had a network where multiple nodes represented the same location with multiple entrances (e.g. Penn Station has multiple entries and exits & our network had multiple nodes representing the same real world location)", "We decided to merge our dataset with US Census Bureau census tracts which removed the above problem. We have 580+ nodes in the final network and are worked with analysing census tract as node and number of trips between two census tracts represented as an edge.", "1. Trips taken in each month(fig-i) peaks between March-May and drops substantially during June onwards. This can be attributed directly to the weather pattern, as commuters are expected to avoid walking long distances during low temperatures or rainy weather.", "2. For our full dataset, the degree distribution is shown in first plot whereas the second plot shows degree distribution for graph generated using edges with at-least 500 trips in 2015.", "3. The heat-map (fig iii) shows relative trip-density for each hour of the day in 2015. From this information, we summarise that the busiest hours are 6 AM to 9 AM. We attribute most of this traffic to users on their daily work-commute whereas there is a remarkable increase in density between 12 AM to 4 AM on weekends. We are looking for an approach to perform similar analysis on the network structure generated from our subset, to create temporal traffic density visualisation.", "4. We analysed the cost vs duration relationship for the trips and found interesting abnormal number of constant cost trips. We are attributing these trips to :", "The full network is approximately represented on its actual geographic location and we have mapped out-degree to node size & trips as edge thickness. We observed that:", "When we divide our nodes into two subcategories by number of trips greater than or equal to 500 and less than 500 respectively, and plot them in-degree/out-degree against the total number of trips, two stark contrast appear.", "The top two graphs on Figure 5 speak for nodes with number of trips greater than or equal to 500, with blue graph marks the in-degree to trips ratio and the red graph for out-degree. The bottle two graphs are for nodes with number of trips less than 500.", "For number of trips>=500, most of the outliers on the far right of the graphs have their physical locations in Madison Square Garden, Penn Station such inner city attractions. This means that a large number of people coming to these attractions from relatively small number of places and most of these in-coming places are located in Manhattan (e.g. 250,000 trips coming from about 200 places. On average 1250 trips from a single locale).", "For number of trips >=500, most of the outliers on the far right of the graphs have their physical locations in Airports (LaGuardia as well as JFK), and their trips versus degree ratio is much smaller, meaning that a small amount of people coming from all sorts of places. And we can easily identify places with low connectivity by looking at the \u201ctail\u201d of the plot, and we found out that the smaller this ratio is, the farther away the node is from Manhattan.", "We divided the network into 3 communities, using multilevel community detection in igraph library. The above plot has these communities mapped by size to number of trips leaving each node in the whole year. The 3 communities can be described as follows:", "We plotted a snapshot of the trips leaving major NYC areas and this shows, Manhattan is the most connected of all, whereas most trips from Lower east side, East village & Brooklyn end up towards northern sides of NYC. With a small fraction ending up within the community itself.", "Your home for data science.
