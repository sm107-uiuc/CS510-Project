You could, of course think R is more useful than Python for various reasons. Even if you oppose my declaration, I still hope to start a conversation where we can all see the benefits of both programming languages. For data scientists, I believe Python has more benefits than R does. I do realize that R has some unique and powerful statistical libraries that could most likely overshadow Python libraries: however; the overall data science process can reap more positives from being able to scale with data engineers, software engineers, and machine learning engineers with the use of Python.", "Below, I will discuss five major reasons to why I think Python is better than R. The reasons include: scalability, Jupyter Notebooks, library packages, integrations, and having the ability to become a cross-functional team-member.", "Scalability is an enormous benefit to employ in data science. Because most data scientists oftentimes work with other employees from an engineering department, modeling can become easier to deploy, as well as a model\u2019s general, overall process. For example, a typical data scientist could focus on performing only modeling, perhaps even a one-off output. However, there is a step before modeling that you will most likely need to do before training your machine learning model. That step is the data engineering part. With this part of the process, you can read in new data automatically from a SQL database, so that your model is always up-to-date when training. On the other side of process is the deployment aspect. It can be quite intimidating to deploy a model for the first time, especially because it is not taught in school nearly as much as the modeling process.", "Software engineers and machine learning engineers can work side-by-side with you, because of Python.", "You can create Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that could automatically train the model when there is new data on a specific schedule or when certain parameters are satisfied (e.g., only train this model if we obtain 100 new records of incoming data). Once the model is trained, it can evaluate new data, which can then be outputted into a SQL table through the use of Python.", "Or another similar visualization tool for data science, is able to interpret Python. You can run cells of code, comment, create headings, and add widgets that can improve the functionality of your notebook. The code you write and share here is Python. Being able to code in this programming language in your Jupyter Notebook is a big win for data scientists.", "There are several powerful and commonly used packages that can be accessed with Python. Some that come to mind are sklearn (also referred to as sci-kit learn) and TensorFlow.", "This powerful data science library has both classification and regression models packaged and ready to utilize for your dataset.", "Sklearn\u2019s definition of classification is: identifying the category an object belongs to. Some popular algorithms include support vector machines (SVM), nearest neighbors, and random forest. Sklearn also outlines spam detection and image regression as some of their top popular application use cases.", "Sklearn\u2019s definition for regression is: predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object. Popular regression algorithms include Support Vector Regression (SVR) and nearest neighbors with applications like drug response and stock prices.", "For deep learning, this library is the go-to for my modeling more complex situations. Some of the main projects one can work on with this popular and powerful library are: neural networks, general adversarial networks, and neural machine translation with attention.", "Because I have used Python for the majority of my data science projects, I have had success in integrating the model .py files into an object-oriented programming format. The files are methodically developed in a modular fashion. Calling APIs in Python is somewhat simple because there is so much documentation on websites that helps in the process of obtaining website/company data.", "This reason is somewhat a combination of scalability and integrations. If you want to perform data science processes locally and hand-off the output to your stakeholder that is fine, but with Python you can do so much more with different experts from engineering.", "When I first started coding, it was in R, and when I would show my process and code to data engineers and software engineers for deployment purposes, it would take some extra time to accurately describe the data science behind the code.", "I would also find out that most of those engineers I was working with that would help me in deploying my model would already be using Python, so they could translate my data science code rather easily, even if they did not fully understand how the model worked.", "As you can see, there are plenty of benefits for data scientists who choose to use Python. While both programming languages are extremely useful and successful, I have found in my personal experience that Python is better than R. Those main reasons include, but are not limited to: scalability, Jupyter Notebooks, library packages, integrations, and cross-functionality. Ultimately, the language of choice is up to you, the data scientist, but the goal of this article is to show how I use Python for data scientist projects, and why using it is better than R programming.", "I hope you found this article both interesting and useful.
