I wanted to learn more.", "This went on for some time, until I finally gave up on trying to learn how to code.", "I was so used to structured classes, and there seemed to be no well-defined syllabus that would take me from \u201czero to hero\u201d in coding.", "\u201cWell, at least I tried. Now I know this isn\u2019t for me,\u201d I thought to myself.", "Fast forward a year later, after talking to a few programmers and doing some reading of my own, I realized I was stuck in something called a tutorial trap.", "The tutorial trap is really easy to fall into.", "You want to learn to code. Someone out there promises to make you a programmer if you take their course.", "You do this again and again, with new frameworks and languages.", "This is a very tricky situation to be in, especially since you actually feel like you\u2019re learning something during each tutorial.", "Unfortunately, you are unable to apply anything you have learnt. You can\u2019t come up with your own piece of code to solve a problem, let alone create an entire project from scratch.", "If this is you, then its time to break out of the tutorial trap.", "If you\u2019re reading this article because you want a well-defined syllabus to become a programmer, you\u2019re in the wrong place.", "Everybody\u2019s path towards learning to code is different. I will simply point you in the right direction based on what worked for me.", "To break out of the tutorial trap, you first need to stop taking tutorials.", "If you have taken one or two online courses, you know the basic syntax and operators.", "Once you are familiar with the basics and how these work, move on!", "All online courses will teach you the same thing, and taking more than one is just going to waste your time.", "My personal favourite is a website called HackerRank. They have challenges with varying difficulty levels.", "This is a great way to get started with programming once you know the basics. It will help you familiarise yourself with the language.", "These challenges might be a little intimidating at first, since it is your first time solving a problem without coding along.", "If you get stuck along the way, looking at another person\u2019s code will also really help you start thinking. (Don\u2019t just copy paste their code, try to understand how they solve it.)", "As you look at other people\u2019s code, you will notice that they are all different. There is always more than one way to look at a problem, and so many different approaches you can take.", "This will really change the way you think as a programmer, and improve your ability to code.", "Once you have developed some confidence in your ability to code without following a tutorial, you can start with projects!", "When I first started out in the data analytics field, I read the same piece of advice everywhere.", "However, I had no idea what projects to do. Everytime I started something, it would go nowhere and I would never end up completing it.", "This is because I had no solid goal in mind.", "When creating a project, always have one solid end goal in mind. Also, make sure it is a project you are interested in doing. Otherwise you\u2019ll never end up completing it.", "You want to analyze trends in the music industry over time.", "End goal: Finding patterns in music trends over time, with data such as artist name and genre.", "In order to do this, you will first need to collect the data.", "This can be done with the help of a web scraper or an API. This will require quite a lot of coding, and is a great intermediate level coding project by itself.", "Then, you will need to clean the data. This is a simple task, but can be very time consuming because of just how messy the data can be.", "You don\u2019t need to have high level programming skills to perform data analytic tasks. Most of what needs to be done is data manipulation, which doesn\u2019t require much logic to do.", "Finally, you can perform the actual analysis. You will need to know how to use visualization libraries in order to do this, which are pretty easy to pick up on. Matplotlib and Seaborn are two popular Python visualization libraries.", "This is just a rough idea on the steps you should take to learn coding for data science.", "I understand that data science is a field that attracts people from various different backgrounds. If you are from a non-technical background, the coding part may seem really intimidating at first.", "Everyone seems to be writing these really complex, large pieces of code that don\u2019t make sense.", "Even the best programmer started out with \u201cHello World,\u201d and you just need to be patient.", "Give yourself some time to learn, and embrace the learning curve. Just like learning to swim, drive, or ride a bike, learning to code doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes a lot of practice and staring at a computer screen to get there.", "I hope this article was helpful, thanks for reading!", "Making mistakes simply means you are learning faster \u2014 Weston H Agor", "Your home for data science.
