I spent over 15 years building highly complex models and analytics on those screens with the rectangular boxes that so many have come to rely on.", "Then, in early 2016, it all changed for me. The fuss had started about R and Python, and I asked a few people who were \u2018in the know\u2019 which software they believed to be the best for conducting the widest range of analytics. The unanimous answer I received pointed to R (probably due to the people I spoke to). So I decided I am going to learn this thing, and find out if all the hype is worth it.", "Six months later, after a lot of late nights and weekends, and through finding whatever chances I could to solve work related problems using R, I was in a situation where I could not bear the idea of working in a spreadsheet again. I\u2019m serious. Today it is a chore to open them, and the only reason I do so is because I communicate with some people who are in the same position as I was 3 years ago.", "I look at functions like VLOOKUP and I compare them to dplyr::left_join(). It\u2019s like I am standing on a street littered with trash, and on one side is an unfortunate man who has a small litter picker and is picking the pieces up one by one, and on the other side is someone carrying the biggest, most powerful litter vacuum you\u2019ve ever seen.", "So I believe spreadsheets are not good for us. They trap us in this narrow set of views and options, use up all our computer\u2019s memory on their pretty look and feel, decide to sulk and storm off to the other room when there\u2019s too much data, and all because (like our kids with Snapchat) we have become addicted to instant visual-analytic gratification.", "There\u2019s another reason spreadsheets have caused harm over the years \u2014 they have created a corporate reproducibility crisis.", "An important part of the scientific method is the requirement to reproduce results in order to validate them. Most academics agree that, at least in the social and life sciences, we are in the middle of a reproducibility crisis. Psychology is a field that has been heavily tarred with this brush in recent years. The speed at which \u2018research\u2019 is published in recent years has led to a lot of questionable research practices. In a survey of 2,000 psychologists, the majority admitted to using at least one questionable research practice, with false positives and confirmation bias being rife among respondents. The extreme end of this is, of course, outright fraudulent research, which psychology and other fields have by no means been free of.", "The rise of \u2018pop psychology\u2019 publications and the massively increasing quotation of psychology theories and research in the general media has led to situations where unvalidated ideas are gaining ground as \u2018truth\u2019 with no attempt to critique or validate the results that gave rise to the theories. In attempts to study the extent of the reproducibility crisis in psychology, studies have found that less than half of research that was conducted to validate previous research did actually validate it.", "For a field like psychology, this is potentially very damaging. We have seen a positive trend in recent years towards increasing trust in the value of psychologists and psychometricians in business and enterprise as part of the increasing recognition of the strategic importance of talent. But continued undisciplined publishing will no doubt drive increasing confusion and lack of clarity in the field \u2014 there will likely come a time when you can find something that backs up whatever point you want to make. This dilution will harm the field in the long term.", "Putting academia to one side for a moment, I propose that in enterprise or corporate contexts analytics needs to be reproducible to be successful. Often it\u2019s not necessarily to validate previous results (although I think that\u2019s always a good thing to do), but commonly similar analysis needs to be repeated for operational reasons. We are seeing increasing complexity in the nature and type of analysis that is being conducted in enterprise settings, and it is very dangerous to conduct such analysis once and leave no straightforward way of reproducing it in the future. The analysis might need to be run again when the context changes, or another group within the business may need to try to repeat it for a different purpose,", "Spreadsheets make it much, much harder to reproduce analytics, particularly if it is complex in nature. Here are a few reasons why:", "Open source data science languages overcome all of these challenges. Everyone has access to the software and code base they need. Code is written in a linear, logical way and commenting is easy so that fellow users can follow your logic and understand exactly what you are doing at each step. The ability to integrate code into vertical documents through Markdown and Jupyter notebooks allows us to write full research descriptions containing methodology, code and results.", "If you are an analytics leader in an enterprise where the majority of the work is still being done using spreadsheets, then you are well and truly trapped in the corporate reproducibility crisis. It\u2019s time to bite the bullet and make a move towards coding languages. It\u2019s not easy, and the beginnings can be rough, but with the right commitment and resources it\u2019s very doable.", "If you are already on that journey, here are a few things I insist on as best practices to aid reproducibility of work:", "A future where we can reproduce analytics with ease is an exciting one, and increasingly important to achieve . But spreadsheets won\u2019t help us get there.", "Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist. I am passionate about applying the rigor of all those disciplines to complex people questions. I\u2019m also a coding geek and a massive fan of Japanese RPGs. Find me on LinkedIn or on Twitter.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Expert and Author in Applied Mathematics, Data Science, Statistics.
