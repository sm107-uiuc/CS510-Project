In its classical form, Ridge Regression is essentially Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression with a tunable additive L2 norm penalty term embedded into the risk function. The invention of Ridge Regression was originally motivated as a solution for ill-posed least squares problems with severe or perfect collinearity in the covariates of the design matrix X (making the matrix from the inner product of the transpose of X and itself either severely unstable or non-invertible). Implementation of the Ridge Regression \u201cregularizes\u201d the mentioned non-invertible matrix, adjusting it to be invertible and providing a closed form solution for parameter estimates similar to OLS.", "However, in modern times the Ridge Regression is most popularly leveraged as a general tool for empirical risk minimization in Statistical Learning and Machine Learning; i.e. purposely specifying biased statistical estimators in the interest of greatly reducing the variance (and thus improving efficiency) of said statistical estimators for prediction.", "Note, the term \u201cRidge penalty\u201d is often used today to refer to the embedding of a L2 penalty in the risk function of most any statistical model (examples: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, etc). However, in this article, our use of the term \u201cRidge Regression\u201d refers specifically to its classical definition (OLS with a tunable additive L2 norm penalty).", "It turns out there is a connection between classical Ridge Regression and Bayesian Inference. One I find interesting and insightful. Let\u2019s first explore Ridge Regression from a Frequentist perspective, then present a Bayesian Inference problem with a particular set of conditions, and see how the two are connected.", "Let us say we have an additive linear model (where the true functional form is additively linear):", "We are working from a Frequentist Paradigm, i.e. the Beta parameters are in truth fixed. We would like to recover estimates of the beta parameters. However, let us assume we have perfect collinearity in the design matrix X, or we are interested in a Statistical Learning or Machine Learning problem and want to purposely introduce regularization for the purposes of empirical risk minimization. Let us specify the risk function of the Ridge Regression:", "As shown above, we have something similar to the OLS risk function but with an additional additive term. Let us expand this out a bit:", "To solve for the Ridge estimator, we have:", "For those familiar with the OLS estimator, you can see the Ridge estimator above is quite similar. The one difference is the tunable parameter lambda. In this case, lambda \u201cregularizes\u201d the matrix from the inner product of the transpose of X and itself forcing it to be invertible. For those who want a derivation and deep dive on the OLS estimator, Gauss Markov Theorem, and required assumptions under varying conditions, see my piece on the subject here.", "Let us say we have an additive linear model (where the true functional form is additively linear):", "But now, we are working from a Bayesian Paradigm; we no longer consider the Beta parameters to, in truth, be fixed but rather are random variables. We would like to fit our model to data, but need to specify a set of priors on our Beta parameters. Let us now consider:", "Let\u2019s now solve for the posterior distribution:", "Note that in the term above, the denominator is simply a normalizing constant. We can consider just the kernel of the posterior distribution above:", "From the expression above, we can compute the mode of the posterior distribution, or the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate:", "We have shown that, under certain conditions, Bayesian Regression is equivalent to Ridge Regression under the Frequentist Paradigm. In a certain sense, we can think about regularization in the Frequentist Paradigm as serving a somewhat similar function to specifying priors in the Bayesian Paradigm.", "I hope the above is insightful. As I\u2019ve mentioned in some of my previous pieces, it\u2019s my opinion not enough folks take the time to go through these types of exercises. For me, this type of theory-based insight leaves me more comfortable using methods in practice. A personal goal of mine is to encourage others in the field to take a similar approach.
