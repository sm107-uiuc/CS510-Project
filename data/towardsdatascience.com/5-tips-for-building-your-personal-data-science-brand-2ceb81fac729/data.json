Ever since I\u2019ve engulfed myself in more freelance work, I\u2019ve become much more conscious of my branding strategy \u2014 A brand strategy is simply the long-term plan to develop a successful brand that enables one to achieve specific goals.", "In this day and age, a personal brand is what will distinguish you from other candidates that are equally as qualified as you when applying for roles and contracts (pretty much everything to be honest) that are of interest to you. A strong brand like Nike, Apple, and McDonald's to name a few would form an impression that will last on your audience and customers.", "\u201cWhen you look and sound like everybody else, people would much rather choose the person that is cheapest, or closest, or most convenient\u201d \u2014 Rob Brown, TedTalks 2014", "People would much rather follow another person than they would a specific company so it begs the question \u201cHow do I build my personal Data Science Brand?\u201d", "What is special or unique about you? Everyone has at least one thing that is special or unique about them. If you can\u2019t find it, I suggest you think about what surprises people most about you or what people pull you up most about. For me, one example would be the fact that I once played Football at a very decent level, then became a Postman and now I\u2019m a Data Scientist without much formal education. A non-linear path to say the least!", "The first step involves laying down a foundational story of your uniqueness that you are able to confidently and authentically articulate. For anyone that randomly picks up my CV, you\u2019d probably think I\u2019m joking when I apply for roles because of all the irrelevant roles I\u2019ve had.", "However, with my uniqueness, I am capable of crafting a unique story that details my journey into Data Science which sets me up perfectly to begin to lay out my vision to people I want to attract. This makes leading on to my second tip very simple\u2026", "We\u2019ve had this talk before in The Specialized \u201cData Scientist will Win in The End. Being a generalist in Data Science means your work speaks to everyone. The major problem with this is, not everyone is your ideal client.", "2 major factors that are important for success in your Data Science come from deciding who you speak to with your personal branding:", "1 \u2014 You Can Tailor Your Message to Become More Attractive to The People You Serve", "Not everyone will be attracted to your brand but it\u2019s fine. If you have a clear sense of who you want your Data Science brand to appeal to then you can repel those you don\u2019t want. Nobody likes the people-pleaser, however, in attempting to talk to everyone you end up attracting no one since there are compromises that you\u2019d have to make which would push away both parties. Not everyone that hears your message would agree and resonate with you.", "2 \u2014 You Make Them An Offer They Can\u2019t Refuse", "If you\u2019ve specialized your Data Science skills, you enable yourself to make promises to clients of outcomes that are very specific. Additionally, you can further expand on your promise by designing a specialized offer to aid them in reaching that outcome. On the other hand, a generalist can only be very general with their offers. They are not different from anyone else and remember what we said above? When you look and sound like everybody else, people would much rather choose the person that is cheapest, or closest, or most convenient \u2014 Clearly an offer that can be refused.", "What You Love Doing + What You Do Best + What Your Audience Demand = An Offer That Cannot Be Refused", "People need to know where to find you when they come looking.

In the same way, If someone finds you and do not feel like they are in the wrong place, they will leave. You ought to be able to show people why on earth you are the right person\u2026 QUICKLY.", "\u201cIt\u2019s better to create free content that helps people rather than try to persuade them that you can help.\u201d", "The open-source community has been pivotal to the rapid advancements of Data Science and it is a very effective way to not only build your brand but also to create a repo or trust with the audience that you wish to target. Also, when done correctly, it allows people to identify why exactly they need you!", "Want to know why I use publications? Because they provide your content with greater reach than if you were to publish yourself. Think about it, I\u2019ve got near enough 1000 followers on Medium, and 3000 on Linked in, whereas Towards Data Science has in excess of 500,000 followers on Medium.", "The minute I\u2019ve published my work to Towards Data Science, it has the potential of being seen by up to 500,000 people. Why on earth would I turn that reach down? Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still publish on your own platforms because it is a great way to build an audience, however, it takes a long time. A very long time! \u2014 I spoke about this in a recent youtube video.", "Bear in mind that leverage doesn\u2019t have to be just blogging, in fact, there are many ways to leverage your work. You could present at a meet-up (most likely a webinar, given the current Covid climate), you could host the meet-up, you could be a guest on a podcast. Anyway you can tap into a well developed, mature audience to share your work is a great way to use leverage to get your name out there more.", "To become a leader of a specific niche, you don\u2019t need a large and broad audience.

Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow\u201d", "There are a number of ways you can make your own family based around your brand, for example:", "In my opinion, branding in Data Science is extremely important. More people are getting certifications and more people wish to become Data Scientists making it increasingly competitive in the marketplace.
