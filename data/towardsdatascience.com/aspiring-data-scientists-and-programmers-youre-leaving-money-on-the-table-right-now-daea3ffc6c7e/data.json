Those skills take years to develop (despite the boot camp promises). In the meantime, you can apply the talent you have right now in the gig workplace. Experience with working real-world problems with (or without) real-world requirements gives you a leg-up on the hopefuls who stick to only toy problems.", "The jobs on gig economy platforms can be hit or miss. Competition is fierce, especially for those postings that are global. There are some things you can do to improve your odds of landing good jobs.", "Awareness of what is available is the first step. First, make a list of the skills you feel confident performing on time with professional outputs. Some ideas: Excel Formulas, SQL queries, query tuning, web scraping, SQL server stored procedures, visualizations (Tableau, Power BI), python, R, regression models, churn models. For programmers, this list might include various programming languages, database design, cloud and AWS components such as S3, RedShift, Elastic Compute, ETL.", "I did a snapshot analysis of all of the jobs posted on guru.com on Sept 1, 2020. Specifically looking at the Software and Programming jobs, I created a Tableau Dashboard with my findings. You can access this dashboard on Tableau Public at this link (click here).", "You will find many tabs across the top of the viz. These are some of the more common data science type tasks. I\u2019m adding more as my curiosity strikes me or requests come through in the comments.", "Demand for the programming languages is always high. So, where do typical data science skills fall into this list? Python, SQL, Web scraping are all in the top third of the chart. These are some of the foundational skills you should have to be successful. Picking up gigs is an excellent opportunity to put those skills to use and earn some money.", "Yes, there is money in freelancing. There is a nice sweet spot of budgets shown in the chart below. Admittedly, \u201cunder 250\u201d is a significant span from totally not worth the fuss to a satisfying payday. There are times where one successful job with a client leads to another. Perhaps that leads into a higher-paying job. This happens often, though you should be warned there are consequences about taking work \u2018off platform\u2019. The platforms make their money by taking a cut of the budget, they want to keep you there.", "There is a learning curve. I can help give you some pointers, but you still need to learn from experience. Here are some of my lessons learned.", "4. Is the work worth the pay and vice versa? I\u2019ve done jobs from $5.00 to thousands of dollars. Sometimes the quick $10 hitters are good to keep your spirits up, as long as the work requested is something you know you can do quickly, within 15 minutes. Some requests seem reasonable, and then once you get into the details, it blows up. Be a professional. You are contracted to do this work for this amount. If you\u2019re pretty close to being done, finish it up. Sometimes it\u2019s entirely out of control, or the problem can\u2019t be solved with the architecture or technique they are requesting. In that case, write up a thorough statement of what you accomplished, what you found, and what you recommend the next steps will be.", "I\u2019m wary of 30 hours a week jobs for six months. You are working full-time without benefits or protections. That\u2019s not a gig, that\u2019s a J O B.", "5. Is the client reputable? Will they pay you? Most sites will provide feedback on clients as well as how much money they have spent in the past. I will sometimes filter to clients who want workers located in the United States only. The added benefit is that there are far fewer bids on the jobs, so your chances are better.", "6. Lastly, are you capable of completing the request? Do you have a skillset of an appropriate level? Pick something out of your league; you could find yourself in some trouble. Also, does the request require any special licenses? Tableau development comes to mind. While Tableau Public is free, the enterprise license is pricey. They need to provide you with a key to use.", "Now that you\u2019ve taken a look at what\u2019s out there, it is time to compare your skills list with the requested skills. Is there an area that has job availability that you\u2019re not yet trained up? That might then become next on your training list. This self-assessment will assist you in prioritizing your training based on overall value. The latest deep learning models are fun, but solidifying the basics of requirements gather, project management, professional presentations, data munging, and basic statistics and analysis will take you far. Very far.", "Hopefully, you have a better understanding of where your skillset matches up with the freelance market. Use this information to guide your training and gain experience today with what you know already.", "For those who are interested, please shout out in the responses if you want more info on the following skillsets: Game Design, General Programming, Website Development, Database Design, Troubleshooting, Angular, Node.js, App Development, all of the Cs, Cloud, Graphics, Hardware, Content Management, CRM, CSS, eCommerce, Development, and more.", "Your home for data science.
