Now, I aimed to see how the sub-metrics could be used as a feature descriptor and compared to each other. Would this reveal anything about coffee similarities across region, year, or process method?", "To compute a similarity score, each vector of 10 sub-metrics was compared to all the others using Root-mean-square:", "These scores were computed for all coffees vs all coffees as seen below colorized by score and sorted by country:", "However, in the breakdowns below, I adjusted each graph to be between 0% and 100%. 100% doesn\u2019t mean perfect match, and 0% isn\u2019t no match. It\u2019s relative to the data in each chart where 100% is the maximum similarity (most similar) and 0% is the minimum similarity (least similar).", "We can start by looking at each geographic region. African beans are more similar to South American beans than anywhere else. Central American beans seem very unique and different than the rest, but South American beans have the most in common with other regions.", "This can be further broken down by country, which helps us understand the regions better. It isn\u2019t that African beans don\u2019t compare well to themselves, but South American beans compare that much better to each other than African beans. Some Central American beans compare well to some countries in Africa.", "The results are interesting in how much variety there is and how much coffee is similar to each other. The main differences are Papua New Guinea and the United States that don\u2019t compare well to a multitude of coffees.", "My hope is that this table could helpful as a reference or even compared when people are doing cuppings. I am curious which coffees were cupped together as that might influence experience.", "In my previous analysis using correlation, 2015 stuck out. In this case, 2010 and 2017 seem to be crazy years because relatively, they aren\u2019t similar to other years. 2018 compares well to everything because there are only 8 coffees from the year 2018 in this dataset.", "We can also look at regions by year to see if there are any interesting trends as the year to year weather is important to consider how the crops turn out. This is a very high level, color coded only, but if anyone is curious, I would gladly share the tables for more in-depth inspection.", "South America seems to be the most similar across the years to itself, and I suspect that is due to more coffees being washed instead of natural or dry processed. Central America seems to be the key player in this concept of 2010 and 2017 being weird years.", "Looking at processing, we see what has been seen in the tasting of beans that washing beans homogenizes the tastes in some ways. Washed beans are more similar to other beans than other processes. Natural processed beans are the least similar to themselves.", "We can break this processing down by region to help see how they are similar. As one can see, wet processed beans are all much more similar by region than dry processed beans. African beans that are dry processed seemed the least similar across the board to other regions/processes.", "A simplification of this table can be seen below when calculating the average similarity for Dry vs Dry, Dry vs Wet, and Wet vs Wet.", "In some cases, the dry processed scores are better compared to the wet processed rather than other dry processed beans. That was a little surprising, but one unknown variable is what other beans were graded at the same time. It is possible if one is grading multiple beans at the same time, the scores could have been influenced in similar ways.", "So let\u2019s look at the grading associations!", "The graders each belong to a grading association, and one could assume that within an association, graders would grade coffee more similarly. A few of the graders had very similar scoring, and ideally, everyone would score beans the same. The problem is always that different coffee regions use different grading bodies.", "We can condense this table by removing graders with 10 or less graded coffees. Looking at this, we can see a few grading institutions that are very different from others, but that could also be the types of coffee they grade.", "Most associations have similar grading to themselves as they have to each other. There are a few outliers where they don\u2019t grade similar to anyone else.", "This was another step in the direction of using modern data science and pattern recognition techniques to help understand how coffees grade against each other and determine how similar coffees are by their grade. Q-grading is subjective, but the aim is to have a common language to talk about coffee in a compare/contrast way. Hopefully, as data becomes more integrated in the coffee supply chain, seeing these types of comparisons will not only become more common, but they will become tools that impact what coffees we make.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
