When I\u2019m tallying my score at the end of a round, I\u2019ll also count the number of putts taken, greens hit, and fairways hit. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort, but it can tell you a lot about what areas of your game need practice.", "While taking a data science course at General Assembly, I decided to focus my final project around the data I had been collecting. I built a linear regression model using the Scikit-learn library in Python that can predict stats about your golf performance. And, I packaged the model I built in a simple Flask web application that can be deployed to Heroku for ease of accessibility. Available on Github", "The model I built is focused on two main use cases\u2026", "Golfers often set goals for themselves around the scores they want to shoot. Maybe they want to be able to make the cut in a qualifier, decrease their handicap, or simply shoot their personal best. This tool takes an input of score and outputs a prediction of the average stats needed to shoot that score. For example, if you have a goal to break 80, the tool can give you specific targets to achieve that.", "It is important for golfers to have an understanding of their skill level so that they can manage expectations on the golf course and avoid taking unnecessary risks. This is a useful tool for helping golfers plan their game. It takes stats as an input and predicts the score you are most likely to shoot. For example, if you are going to a difficult course and only expect to hit 5 greens, you can generate a score prediction to understand what you are likely to shoot there.", "We can use data to understand the actions that lead to a great score. It can help us establish specific targets we need to achieve in order to shoot the scores we want. Rather than focusing on transient swing thoughts like \u201ckeep your head down\u201d or \u201cfollow through\u201d we can come up with a specific plan to shoot a low score. For example, we can develop the specific plan to hit more greens by always aiming for the center of the green every time.", "I used data about my own golf game to develop a linear model for predicting stats and scores. Each sample in my dataset represents a round that I played and stats about the round. See the following definitions of each feature\u2026", "After plotting these scores on a scatterplot, the trends made sense based on my experience with the game. As the number of putts you take increases, your score goes up. As the number of greens you hit increases, your score goes down. There was less correlation between the number of fairways hit and your score.", "To make the data represent a larger range of scores, I added samples from a PGA Tour dataset. Each sample in the dataset represented a tour professional and their average stats in each area of the game between 2010 and 2018. The original dataset contained thousands of values, but I sampled 10 values at random to represent players who shoot a range of scores between 69 and 75. After adding the professional stats to my personal dataset, I recreated the scatterplots.", "Because the stats all appeared to have a linear relationship with the score, I chose to fit the data with a linear model, which is fast to train, simple to interpret, and low variance meaning it predicts similar results regardless of the data it is fed. The downside of a linear model is that it can be more biased than the most advanced modeling techniques.", "I imported the linear regression model from Scikit-learn and built a function to fit the model with the data, print a training score, and print a cross validated score with 5 folds. Running the function with my personal data alone, I got the following accuracy values\u2026", "Running the function with my personal data combined with the professional data, I got the following accuracy values\u2026", "The R2 value increased significantly after adding the data from professional golfers. This could be a result of having greater variance in the target variable or providing more more data for the model to learn the correct relationships. After printing the coefficients of my fitted linear model, I was able to put together the following equation to represent a players total score based on putts, fairways, and greens hit.", "To create a tool to predict stats based on an input I score, I fit multiple different linear models with the same data. Instead of using Score as the target variable, I used it as the sole feature with each individual stat as the target variable. The result was 3 linear models for Putts, Fairways, and Greens, fitting the data with a training R2 accuracy of 0.44, 0.33, and 0.83 respectively. Once again, I printed out the coefficients to put together equations that predict the average value of different stats based on a score.", "There are several areas where this model could be improved or expanded in the future.", "More data \u2014 The sample size is small, which leads to inconsistent results when trying to cross validate the model and find the out-of-sample accuracy. The values change drastically depending on what subset of the data is selected for my KFolds cross validation.", "Representative of all golfers \u2014 The data used to train the model is only representative of my skills and the skills of touring professions, leaving a big gap in the dataset. The model needs additional samples from advanced players who shoot between 75\u201380 and beginner players who shoot > 100. Filling in this gap could allow me to explore different models that may result in a more accurate prediction.", "Consistent sampling methods \u2014 The data for my personal scores were collected in a different way than the data for the pro scores. Each sample in of pro scores was an average of stats over many rounds. Each sample of my scores represented a specific round I played. Taking averages can remove important variance in the data that can be used to make more accurate predictions.", "More features \u2014 There is potential to create/modify features that are more closely related to score. For example, not all courses have the same number of fairways. By creating a feature that details the number of fairways on the course, we could transform the Fairways stat into a percentage rather than an absolute number.", "Your home for data science.
