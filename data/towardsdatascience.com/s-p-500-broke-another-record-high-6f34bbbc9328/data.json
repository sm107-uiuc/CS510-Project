Out of 17,438 days, that\u2019s only 7% of days in which the numbers ticked up \u2014 or in most cases rocketed \u2014 to a new \u201call-time high.\u201d", "As far as I can gather, though, there\u2019s nothing particularly astounding about reaching a new \u201call-time high\u201d when we\u2019ve been seeing these numbers inch up and up and up for more than 70 years. To put this in greater perspective, only one president saw their entire time in office without seeing a new all-time high at least once, and that was Gerald Ford, who by all accounts got the short end of a political stick following Nixon\u2019s resignation.", "Below is a graph that shows the S&P 500 from 1950 to 2019. The take away is that this index has increased by 17,540% since the beginning of 1950\u2014 which is a meaningless value other than to say it\u2019s a lot higher than it used to be. More to the point on arbitrary announcements of \u201call time highs\u201d is the fact that on average, the S&P 500 has been growing at 1.0058% every trading day. (When we include weekends/holidays, when trading does not occur, we\u2019re talking about 0.69% per day \u2014 which still has the net impact of moving in an upwardly direction.)", "The second image shows two different measures. The blue columns show the maximum value that the S&P reached during the entire tenure of each president. Notice that each blue column is higher than the one before it (except for Gerald Ford \u2014 if you can make it out). The green columns represent what the value of S&P was on the date that the president was sworn into office. You\u2019ll notice that the column from George W. Bush to Barack Obama saw a very significant decrease \u2014 37% \u2014 which was due to the recession. This also occurred when President Ford was sword into office after Nixon resigned in August of 1974. But generally, green columns should be higher for each president being sworn in from when their predecessor began.", "Below shows the growth (or loss \u2014 in red) from the closing value on the first inaugural address, to the last day in office. For example, the S&P (which was then the S&P 90) closed at 26.41 on Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s inaugural day, and on his last day as president it closed at 59.77 \u2014 a 129% increase. Whereas for President George W. Bush, the economy had suffered with a negative-37% drop. One way to look at this is to see that Richard Nixon and George W. Bush left office with the S&P closing at a lower value than when they were sworn into office.", "The next image shows the growth from the minimum closing value and the maximum closing value during each president\u2019s time in office (or the variance). For example, the lowest closing value during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency was 102.42 and the maximum was 336.77 \u2014 which is a 229% difference.", "The next image shows the percentage of days in office in which the S&P closed with a \u201cnew record high.\u201d", "Take note that President Ford saw no record breaking days, and that President George W. Bush saw the next minimum number of days, which was less than 1%. The median was 7%. It\u2019s worth pointing out two things: Truman and Trump both have, respectfully, 1109 and 825 days of tenure reflected in these graphs.", "In this regard, Truman saw 109 new \u201crecord highs\u201d, and Trump has seen 80. I suggest taking these data with caution because without full presidential terms, the data will be skewed. For example, George W. Bush saw technical growth, at the very least in perpetuation of a good economy, but then it tanked. That\u2019s the weakness of Figure 5, but in context of Figure 1 you can see it for what it is worth.", "Carrying on this same trend, we don\u2019t see that there were no \u201crecord highs\u201d under President Barack Obama\u2019s first term. All of his growth took place in the last three years as president \u2014 which is astounding. If we were to break this graph down by term, we would see that in Obama\u2019s first 825 days of his second term, he saw 104 new \u201crecord highs\u201d \u2014 which is 20% higher than Trump\u2019s current first term.", "Standard & Poor\u2019s, i.e., S&P, has been around since 1860, but the modern version of it was the result of the merger between Poor\u2019s Publishing and Standard Statistics Bureau in 1941. Prior to this merger, Poor\u2019s Publishing had created its first \u201ccomposite index\u201d in 1923. From 1926 to 1957, the composite index was made up of 90 stocks, therein called S&P 90. In 1957 this index was expanded to 500, although today it is 505.", "The Nasdaq composite was founded in 1971, so I thought it would be good to add 21 years of data for the sake of trends. The Dow Jones Industrial average (DJI), although it has been around for a while, these stocks are included in the S&P 500, so it would be redundant to do a secondary analysis with DJI. Additionally, S&P is representative of the industries in the market which makes it an ideal benchmark for analysis.", "I downloaded the data from Yahoo, and then painstakingly put a 1 next to each value that was higher than the previous recorded high, and therefore constituted a \u201cnew high\u201d. For example:", "For all 17,438 recorded days. I then tallied (summed) the number of days by each president to arrive at the total number of days in which the S&P 500 closed with a \u201cnew high.\u201d I rounded by two decimals (although Yahoo gave upwards of 10) for the sake of finding newly recorded highs. You might be thinking \u201cwell that\u2019s an arbitrary\u201d decision, which is true, but consider that \u201crecord S&P highs\u201d are fairly small.", "But, the primary reason behind my decision to stick to two decimal points is because that\u2019s how the index is typically shown. This means that in my analysis a 15.01 would be considered a new high if the previous record was 15.00.", "Research suggests very little. A working paper by Alan Blinder and Mark Watson (National Bureau of Economic Research) found that Democratic presidents see a 1.8% higher growth rate in GDP than do Republican presidents, but explained at least 50% of this away by market factors that are outside of the president\u2019s control \u2014 like oil shocks, consumer spending, etc. In effect, they determined that Republicans have poorer luck with regard to that, but experience more stable economies, whereas Democrats see greater growth, fewer problems, and more vulnerability.", "Similar points \u2014 that president\u2019s have little to no control over the economy \u2014 have been made by folks at FiveThirtyEight, The Atlantic, The New York Times, the National Review, and Bloomberg. The lessons are this: 1) presidents have very little impact on the economy in real time, with the largest overall impact being their choice of Fed Chairman, but this even has a minimal impact. 2) Luck, however you want to measure or define it, has a larger impact. Presidents who are elected in the middle of a recession (ex. Ford, Obama), have a lot to do when starting. 3) Economic policy tends to have an impact long after the respective president has left office. It takes years.", "While it is exciting to see \u201crecord breaking\u201d digits, it\u2019s all in context of something, and almost entirely in context of something that well outside the confines of the West Wing (or the golf course).", "For example, the rally that resulted in a new all time high for the S&P 500 on April 23rd was more exciting because it made up for the losses that had been taking place since September (which was more than 25 points). That context is more exciting from an economic standpoint than the fact that the S&P set a new record .", "But consider that the S&P 500 and other market indices have no theoretical maximum value, which is to say that it will continue to move in an upwardly direction forever (outside of bear markets, recessions, depressions, and typical fluctuation).", "More to the whole point of this article is that it is arbitrary to continue to boast \u201cnew record highs\u201d, not simply because unless capitalism, inflation, markets, etc., cease to exist, but because its a forgone conclusion. For example, with exception of Gerald Ford, every president saw a record high.", "The image above shows the average number of \u201crecord highs\u201d in a given 30-day period for each president. For example, Donald Trump currently sees a new record high about once every 10-days. President Obama saw a new record about every 23 days. But, for perspective, Obama didn\u2019t begin seeing new records set until March 28th, 2013 (well into his second term). Once this began, he saw a new record set every 11 days. Richard Nixon saw a new record once every 58 days, and George W. Bush only saw a new record every 325 days \u2014 which makes sense because the economy crashed.", "The purpose of this image is to emphasize the point that we\u2019re going to see an average of a new record high about once a week. What this will actually look like is that we\u2019ll go weeks or months with drops, and stagnation, and then a few record setting days. Kind of like what we\u2019re seeing now on April 23rd, and then again on April 26th in which Market Watch exclaimed twice in one week that we saw \u201cnew records\u201d set with S&P 500.", "Context matters, and I would say it\u2019s what differentiates good news from arbitrary news.", "Your home for data science.
