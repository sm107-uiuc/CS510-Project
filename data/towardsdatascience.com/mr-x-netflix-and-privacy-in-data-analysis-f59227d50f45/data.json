With a large amount of data present on the internet, we know a lot more about each other now, more than ever before. This data has helped the analysts for a long time to understand how our society is working, and proved useful to provide a solution for the problems present in it.", "But with the emerging cases of data breaches in almost every part of the world, individuals and authorities are getting more and more concerned about how their data is being used. As a result of this, there is a heightened awareness about data privacy among individuals and organizations, this leaves a big problem for analysts like us, who are solely dependent on data to generate new, and useful insights.", "So how do we provide analytical services that preserve privacy, when our job is to learn statistical insights from the data to better understand the trends in society. The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines (Cynthia Dwork et. al.). The only option remaining is to learn about the insights from the data as a whole, and not learn anything about an individual. That\u2019s where the concept of differential privacy comes into play, it is an exciting, new multidisciplinary field that allows us to develop techniques for so-called private data analysis.", "As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.", "The abstract given above is taken from the Algorithmic Foundation of differential privacy, a must-read book on the subject, written by Cynthia Dwork, often considered as the Godmother of differential privacy.", "\u201cDifferential privacy\u201d describes a promise, made by a data holder, or curator, to a data subject: \u201cYou will not be affected, adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used in any study or analysis, no matter what other studies, data sets, or information sources, are available.\u201d", "The above given is the formal definition of differential privacy. Let\u2019s try to break it down and understand what it tries to convey.", "If nothing new is learned about an individual even after performing analysis on a data he was part of, we can say that we preserved his private information.", "To understand the last part of the definition let\u2019s watch Netflix.", "In the late 2000s, Netflix ran a competition to develop a better film recommendation algorithm. To drive the competition, they released an \u201canonymized\u201d viewing dataset that had been stripped of identifying information. Unfortunately, this de-identification turned out to be insufficient. In a well-known piece of work, Narayanan and Shmatikov showed that such datasets could be used to re-identify specific users \u2014 and even predict their political affiliation! \u2014 if you simply knew a little bit of additional information about a given user.", "So we now understand that changing actual values with certain integer values is not a solution to the problem of preserving privacy while performing data analysis. Differential privacy comes into play here, it says that even if a related data is present out there, we can still prevent any adversary to extract out the information from this dataset and learn anything new about an individual.", "Now we know that data anonymization is not the solution to the problem of preserving privacy while doing data analysis. But that is not the only concern here, let\u2019s see a few more.", "This means it doesn\u2019t matter if you are part of this database or not, as long as your presence or absence in the data does not change the output to the queries to the database.", "Suppose it is known that Mr. X is in a certain medical database. Taken together, the answers to the two large queries \u201cHow many people in the database have the sickle cell trait?\u201d and \u201cHow many people, not named X, in the database have the sickle cell trait?\u201d yield the sickle cell status of Mr. X.", "But there are problems with this approach, first is that this task is computationally infeasible, and secondly refusing to answer a query is itself disclosive, refusing to answer a query suggests to the adversary that he is on the right path to compromise privacy.", "Differential privacy proposes a methodology that can help us to perform analytical studies on data without LEAKING any private information from it.", "So we understood what is differential privacy and why should we use it to perform privacy-preserving data analysis. This article is Ist in the series of articles I am going to write on privacy in data analysis.", "In the next article, we will dig deeper into technical terms related to differential privacy and understand how does it actually work.", "Stay Tuned. Happy Learning for now.", "PS. This is my first article on medium, so any feedback and suggestions are most welcome.", "Your home for data science.
