It has multiple meanings, so you have to listen carefully for the context. Is the word being used casually, the way little kids use it?

No wonder you\u2019re tempted to impress everyone by telling them that you \u201cdid an experiment\u201d too. It\u2019s impressive! An experiment is the only legitimate* tool that gives you a license to use the word \u201cbecause\u201d in polite conversation.", "An experiment gives you permission to talk about what causes what.", "Consider a scientist\u2019s emotions upon seeing a document in which you have written the word \u201cexperiment\u201d \u2014 be still our little hearts! We\u2019re about to unwrap a birthday present! We\u2019re going to see what causes what!!! We\u2019re so excited!", "Can you imagine the crushing disappointment when we discover that what you have called an \u201cexperiment\u201d is this?", "As a statistician, I was trained to be precise with terminology but I\u2019m also fairly relaxed when it comes to other people using their words incorrectly. As long as there are no dangerous consequences and we more-or-less understand one another, I don\u2019t mind.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to spend all my speak-properly-damnit coupons on this one word: experiment.

They\u2019re safewords, in the sense that if you say them instead of experiment, your statistician will stop hurting you.", "Why would professionals put \u201cexperimental design\u201d skills on their resumes if all it means is \u201clet\u2019s just see what happens?\u201d", "The first three are \u201cstudy,\u201d \u201cinvestigation,\u201d and \u201canalysis\u201d \u2014 you can use those for anything. When in doubt, just call everything a \u201cstudy.\u201d", "The word \u201cstudy\u201d can refer to any old thing \u2014 feel free to use that word however you please.", "If you want to jargon up a little bit, the technical term for \u201clet\u2019s just see what happens\u201d is \u201cobservational study.\u201d", "You could also call what you\u2019ve done a \u201cpilot\u201d or a \u201ctrial\u201d if you\u2019re okay with implying that you intend to come back and do something a little bit more rigorously designed later.", "Finally, the seventh word for \u201clet\u2019s just see what happens\u201d is\u2026", "If you want to use the word to refer \u2014 as children do \u2014 to a tentative procedure, then please don\u2019t do it around people who are discussing grown-up matters like business, science, or policy. To them, an experiment is a solid, well designed, controlled attempt to understand what causes what. They\u2019ll be referring to experiments while discussing questions like, \u201cDoes this vaccine actually work?\u201d Questions where a misunderstanding can be extremely costly. If you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re dealing with a real experiment, avoid the word.", "What is an experiment in the scientific sense and why does it carry legitimizing connotations?", "An experiment is the best scientific instrument for causal reasoning by actively controlling (and eliminating) alternative explanations. If you\u2019re about to use the word in the context of data, then make sure all of the following components are present:", "A hypothesis is not enough to make a study an experiment. For example, I might have the null hypothesis that the true average height of human adults is above 3m, then I can collect data which will lead me to conclude that this null hypothesis looks ridiculous. I will be left with the scientific theory that a 10ft giant would exceed the human adult average. Yay, science! With no experiment anywhere near it!", "A theory is what a hypothesis becomes when it grows up.", "By the way, did you notice I used the word \u201ctheory\u201d there? Yup, a theory is the best thing science can make. It\u2019s what a hypothesis becomes when it grows up. (People confuse the two, thinking that a theory is something less than a hypothesis. It isn\u2019t.)", "I didn\u2019t say \u201cscientific fact\u201d since that\u2019s a quick way to reveal you have no idea how science works. Scientists don\u2019t worship information and they\u2019re only willing to hold on to theories until better ones come along, at which point they\u2019ll drop that old theory like a hot potato. Meanwhile the public reverently spends the next few years continuing to burn its hands on it, \u201cbecause science.\u201d", "But let\u2019s get back on track. A hypothesis is not enough to make something an experiment, but you should have one\u2026 otherwise you won\u2019t know how to apply treatments.", "The most special thing about an experiment is that we\u2019re not just going to observe data passively anymore. Instead, we\u2019ll impose our will upon reality! Bwahahaha\u2014", "To do an experiment, we must make different changes to different parts of the universe. The various things we do are called treatments. (Even if the experiment has nothing to do with medicine.) A treatment where we do nothing extra is called a control. A control where we pretend to do something while actually doing nothing is called a placebo.", "If there is any variability among the experimental units (objects or victims, er, I mean participants) before we begin, then it\u2019s not a real experiment unless the units are randomly assigned to treatment groups.", "Randomization plus large-enough** sample sizes is the secret sauce that makes an experiment a valid tool for causal inference.", "If we have those three components, we truly have an experiment. The kind with teeth. We get the ability to talk about what causes what\u2026 even under uncertainty! This is amazing. Without experiments, all you have is correlation. Correlation is a nice way of saying \u201ctwo patterns appear to move together but we\u2019ll be laughed at if we use this to conclude that one causes the other.\u201d", "For example, if an observational study finds that people who drink red wine tend to live longer, that\u2019s a mere correlation. No one force-fed wine to some people at random while keeping others away from it. It could be that people who are healthier/wealthier/more French/whatever live longer for some other reason and coincidentally also happen to drink more red wine. Without an experiment, there\u2019s no evidence that red wine will make you healthier.", "If you\u2019re interested in seeing an experiment in action to understand why they work as tools for making inferences about cause-and-effect, take a look at the logic behind one of the simplest experiments you can do: the A/B test.", "Treatment randomization is the secret sauce that makes an experiment tick.", "If you\u2019d like me to walk you through an explanation of A/B testing, head over to my article How do A/B tests work?", "Pretty opinions are fine and dandy when there\u2019s not much at stake, but there are a few settings in which it\u2019s dangerous to make conclusions without experiments.", "If there was no real experiment, be very skeptical of anyone using the word \u201cbecause\u201d to explain connections between complex phenomena. What that person is really saying is, \u201cI have an opinion that sounds reasonable in my own head and I didn\u2019t really do the homework that it takes to eliminate alternative explanations. I like my story and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d", "Five examples (among many!) where I\u2019d urge you to demand a real experiment before jumping to conclusions:", "A look at the last item will remind you that sometimes it\u2019s too difficult/expensive/unethical to carry out an experiment. Sure, sometimes we can\u2019t afford nice things (like a license to use the word \u201cbecause\u201d instead of \u201cI hope\u201d).", "Without an experiment, our actions are based on hope instead of evidence.", "If life\u2019s so unfair that you can\u2019t do an experiment, that doesn\u2019t qualify you to skip to the part where act as if you did do one anyway. Instead, admit that you\u2019re groping around blindly in the dark and proceed with three extra heaps of caution.", "If you want to say thank you, I appreciate shares and retweets. If you\u2019re keen to read more of my writing, most of the links in this article take you to my other musings.", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "*Causal inference is a subfield of statistics with sophisticated attempts to make conclusions about cause-and-effect without experiments. Be advised that you\u2019d have to be willing to swallow a mountain of assumptions to make those approaches valid, so not everyone buys into them. They also tend to rely quite heavily on the idea that \u201cwe thought of everything\u201d which, given the beautiful fallibility of our species, is quite a stretch. Well-designed experiments that exploit randomness in large sample sizes are much more convincing.", "**One day, I\u2019ll write about power analysis and how to size an experiment, but in the meantime you can find definitions in my other articles [1] & [2].", "Let\u2019s be friends!
