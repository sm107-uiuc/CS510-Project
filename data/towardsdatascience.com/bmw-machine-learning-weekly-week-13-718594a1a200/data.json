They conducted consumer research and partnered with the City of Boston to assess the impact of autonomous vehicles in the city by testing autonomous vehicles there, and the strategize how the city could foster this technology to achieve its mobility goals. The result was a traffic simulation model, through which they found that self-driving cars could lead to a 5.5 percent increase in traffic in the city\u2019s downtown. While there will be fewer cars on the road overall, congestion will increase because commuters will likely choose the new vehicle over public transportation. However, other districts of Boston actually saw a decrease in traffic. In order to prevent more gridlock in urban areas such as Boston, the report recommends to lower prices for autonomous carpoolers, to convert parking lots into pick-up and drop-off zones, and to create self-driving-only lanes.", "For much of the last decade, a technology industry ruled by smartphones has pursued a singular goal of completely conquering our eyes, which has given us phones with ever-bigger screens. But we seem to have reached something called \u201cpeak screen,\u201d where tech giants started building the beginning of something new: a less insistently visual tech world, a digital landscape that relies on voice assistants, headphones, watches and other wearables to take some pressure off our eyes. Depending on how these technologies develop, a digital ecosystem that demands less of our eyes could be better for everyone \u2014 less immersive, less addictive, more conducive to multitasking. We have seen this in cars for years: By placing interior controls on touch screens rather than tactile knobs and switches, carmakers have made vehicles much more annoying and dangerous to interact with. The Tesla Model 3 takes this to an absurd level. As several reviewers have lamented, just about every one of the car\u2019s controls \u2014 including adjustments for the side mirrors \u2014 requires access through a screen. In order to move towards the \u201cglorious small-screen future,\u201d the tech industry will need to come up with other, less immersive ways to interact with the digital world: voice assistants.", "When a nuclear power plant accident occurs and radioactive material is released, it is vital to evacuate people in the vicinity as quickly as possible. However, it can be difficult to immediately predict where the emitted radioactivity will settle, making it impossible to prevent the exposure of large numbers of people. Researchers of the University of Tokyo published a paper, presenting their ML-based tool that can predict where radioactive emissions from nuclear power plants will disperse over 30 hours in advance. After training using extensive data on previous weather patterns, the tool consistently achieved over 85 percent predictive accuracy, and up to 95 percent in winter when large and predictable weather systems dominate. This tool can aid immediate evacuation in the aftermath of disasters like those at Fukushima and Chernobyl.", "Your home for data science.
