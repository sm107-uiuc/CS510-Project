It is even extra hard if you do not have a degree in data science or in a technical field.", "In that case, The best thing is to get involved in the data scientist community.

It will take some work to get involved in the data scientists community.", "If you want to get a job or freelance work or start a start-up, you have to get involved and build a community as well.

Whatever small big projects you have done for practice, make a nice and well-organized GitHub profile with them, and keep enriching it.", "You need to have a public profile that shows your skill before you apply for jobs, start networking, or start talking about your skills in public. It gives a lot of credibility and acceptance.", "Employers ask for a Github profile link in your job application. So it\u2019s almost mandatory for coders to have a Github profile.", "It took me some time, in the beginning, to know that GitHub profiles can rank in Google.

Because asking questions is hard. But it\u2019s not hard. It may take a little time to understand, how to ask a question to get help. You will learn it with time. Once you learn that, you will love it.", "Whenever you are stuck with a problem, you have a community to discuss it with for free!!", "After some time, you will be able to answer other people\u2019s questions there.

I even received phone calls from the people I know asking if I am willing to take up a new job or if I know anyone who can do this job.", "This can happen to you if you keep going tp the events, seminars, and conferences. You will keep meeting the same people again and again for several times, Get into technical conversations, and show your expertise.", "It will take some time to build that relationship with people.", "At the same time, you will learn a lot from these events. You learn about other people\u2019s work who are successful, the new technology, learning platforms, and much more.", "Attend conferences and present your projects in the conferences or even in the meetups.

I said \u2018yes\u2019. After that, I was extremely nervous and scared until my presentation. I received so many positive vibes, encouragement and someone even gave me a referral!", "Since then I take every chance to do a presentation. That helped me improve my knowledge so much. Because when I prepare for a presentation I study a lot! I am sure everyone does some extra studying when they know that lots of people will watch them talking.", "You may find this article useful. It has a selection of datasets to do projects with and also some ideas of projects:", "If you start going to meetups, stay involved in social media, you will see so many small big events are going on constantly around you and they are always looking for new presenters.", "Volunteer in those events and slowly engage in conversation with people.", "Try doing it consistently for 3/4 months, You will see that you know people from most big companies in the area.", "Going to meetups and conferences are good. But even better if you can get involved in organizing events, study groups, and conferences. It is not going to happen overtime probably if you do not have a lot of connections already.", "So, make some connections using the previous techniques I explained first and then move on to this stage where you will take the initiatives to organize.", "Look, you do not have to do all the work by yourself!", "The first time I got into a team to organize an event was I helped with pack up. The second time I took the charge of posting on social media on their page three times a week and I met the team once a week.", "It didn\u2019t take too much time. But I got in touch with some incredible people!", "The only thing I need to warn you is, please do not overdo it.", "You have to save some time for yourself as well to study and improve your skills. There is no alternative to that.", "My suggestion is to make a routine or plan. As per your schedule, fix sometime in a week or a day for this networking or community development. And stick to that.", "Otherwise, you will see that you are only busy with social activity and no time to improve your skills. You do not want that. On the other hand, you cannot avoid socializing or networking.", "Because if you have skills and you do not know how to network, it will not help you develop your career.", "So, please find a way to balance them both.
