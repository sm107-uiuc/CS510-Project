Each of them comes with their own benefits, Notebook is the friendliest for custom plugins, Jupyter Lab makes working with multiple notebooks easy, while Jupyter Hub enables multiple users and more.", "However, one of weaknesses of Jupyter is that it does not come with tools for organising projects.", "This is where cookiecutter comes in. For those who has used it before, click here to skip through this section. Otherwise, cookiecutter is a python package that allows us to create a standard folder structure in just a couple of line. And the best thing is, you do not need to conform to the one standard that comes with cookiecutter. Take a look here for other formats!", "And, voila! You should now have a standard folder structure ready to go. In my case, the directory looks like:", "Imagine if you are working on a project in JupyterLab.", "Inspiration hits; and you want to start a new project. What do you do?", "A. Start a terminal; go through Cookiecutter to create another standard folder directory; and launch another JupyterLab at port 8890 to work on this project coz you have 8888 and 8889 running two different JupyterLab sessions already.", "B. Within the same JupyterLab session, start working on Untitled29.ipynb", "C. Forget about it; it\u2019s way too much trouble to start another project, meh!", "We all know the answer, it\u2019s either B, or C.", "So what is wrong with Cookiecutter?", "Cookiecutter is an amazing organisation tool for very-very-very-well-disciplined data scientists to start a new project", "In other words, there are too many clicks between you and your next project with a well-defined standard file structure.", "What if there is a magic button in Jupyter Launcher that can create a Cookiecutter file structure in the current folder?", "To start with, we are going to use the official JupyterLab services example which already comes with the necessary components to make a custom extension in typescript. This blog will be focusing on how this plugin can improve our workflow, plus that you will have access to the repository, so we won\u2019t dive into the code. But feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions!", "In essence, what this plugin does is that it would first track your current folder. Say we create a new folder called example_project and double-click to enter it, you should be able to see example_project above the Notebook section in your Launcher.", "Once you click the Cookiecutter Template button, it would then create a folder structure as below. Give it a couple of seconds and refresh if nothing shows up; magic needs time.", "There are a couple of key features to this specific folder structure:", "All of the above, within a single button!", "Now you don\u2019t have any excuse not to start organising your projects folders! (at least at the very beginning of the project)", "Thanks for reading this blog! Being a disciplined data scientist is never easy; and I must confess I have never been one myself (APOLOGIES). Hopefully this plugin would lower the barrier for everyone to pick up some good habits to make our codebases better organised and more maintainable.
