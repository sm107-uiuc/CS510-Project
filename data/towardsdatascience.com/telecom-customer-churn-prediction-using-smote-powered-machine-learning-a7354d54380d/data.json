What started as an industry with a sole focus on communication technology has today transitioned into the era of cloud technology. If anything, this adds more pressure to the existing woes of the industry, as companies today need to rapidly realign their business models to serve customer demands in the spheres of IoT, Smart Devices, and Augmented Reality, to list a few. Indeed, digital transformation helps telcos move from perish to flourish.", "Survival being the key, it becomes imperative for all telco companies to understand their customers better and limit (if not prevent) the occurrence of the phenomenon called \u2018Churn\u2019. With the correct approach in analyzing the attrition of customers, companies can identify the issues that might exist in their customer service policies or even marketing and pricing strategies.", "The Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) constitutes the marketing spends, advertising spends, sales spend, etc. and generally amounts to be 5 times the value of the Customer Retention Cost (CRC). Thus keeping high value customers at home is very important.", "There is not much that a telecom company can do about the cases where the customer churns because of involuntary reasons, but the company has all the reasons to try identify the customers that churn voluntarily and offer them deals that prevents them from leaving home.", "To predict customers who are likely to churn, we have utilized the publicly available dataset \u201cIBM Telco-Customer-Churn\u201d.", "The dataset had the following features along with the target variable that indicated whether the particular customer had churned from the company\u2019s services or not:", "A quick round of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) leads us to the graph on the left that shows us a common issue concerning customer churn across various industries; Class Imbalance. It is a problem in machine learning where the total number of a class of data is far less than the total number of another class of data. The IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset had an over-representation of the \u2018Not- Churned\u2019 class (73%) and under-representation of \u2018Churned\u2019 class(27%).", "But what is the trouble with class imbalance? Why should an analyst be so bothered about it while creating predictive models?", "Turns out that most machine learning algorithms used for classification are implicitly tuned to work best with equal distribution of the classes of data. In case the distribution of the classes is uneven, the resulting classification models exhibit poor performance, specifically for the under-represented class, also known as the minority class. In our case of churn prediction in telecom, the minority class, or the customers that have churned is the more important class and a high misclassification error defeats the purpose of identifying them in the first place.", "SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) works on the underlying principle of over-sampling the minority class of data. There are several ways to do so, like simply duplicating the minority data samples, but SMOTE works by creating new and original samples.", "Simply put, the new values are created by taking into consideration the samples that lie close to a randomly selected sample of the minority class in the feature space. A line is used to connect these samples and then a new value is created by randomly selecting a point on this line.", "The R code for application of SMOTE and data pre-processing for churn prediction:", "When it comes to dealing with multi-class classification and class imbalanced classification problems, usual performance measures like Accuracy might be misleading. Usually, in the case of class imbalanced data, the Accuracy is over-reported owing to the over-representation of one of the classes.", "Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistic is a handy metric that comes to help in such cases. The Kappa statistic can handle both the above cases pretty well and provides a robust value that is a true representation of the performance of the model.", "where po is the observed agreement, and pe is the expected agreement. In simple terms, the statistic helps in understanding the performance of our classifier when compared with a classifier that guesses at random as per the frequency of each class. Because Cohen\u2019s Kappa takes into consideration the possibility of an agreement between the classifiers occurring by chance, it gives a more robust view of the performance of the model.", "According to Landis and Koch (1977), the way to interpret Cohen\u2019s Kappa is as follows:", "We use the below code in R to generate the Kappa statistic and other metrics like Accuracy, ROC, AUC, etc. to evaluate the best model for the analysis. Various models can be chosen under the CARET library for further analysis.", "Taking a look at the Accuracy and Cohen\u2019s Kappa Statistic for the models used in this case, the following data is obtained.", "Note that before the implementation of SMOTE, the accuracy of the models is fairly high. But the Kappa suggests otherwise (low values), having taken into consideration the class imbalance.", "Post the implementation of SMOTE, the Kappa for the models increase and now belongs in the range of \u2018Substantial Agreement\u2019 as discussed above. Also note the increase in the accuracy.", "Now, let us take a look at the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) for the various models used above. Firstly, we shall see the ROC curves for the models without the implementation of SMOTE.", "Now, the ROC curves for the models after the implementation of SMOTE:", "It is to be noted from the above ROC Curves that the Area Under the Curve increases substantially post the implementation of SMOTE.", "Thus for the purpose of this customer churn predicting model in telecom companies, we go with the Random Forest model which provides the highest Accuracy, Area Under the ROC Curve, and most importantly the Kappa statistic.", "Mentioned at the beginning of this Medium story was a fact that the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is 5 times the Customer Retention Cost (CRC). Keeping the same in mind, we can use this model for analyzing and devising customer retention strategies (thanks to our low misclassification error!). Using targetted marketing campaigns, offers and curated plans can be rolled out to prevent these customers from churning.", "Thus, when life gives you class imbalanced data, SMOTE it, and befriend the Kappa Statistic!", "Inviting you to check out the GitHub repo for the above analysis!", "Your home for data science.
