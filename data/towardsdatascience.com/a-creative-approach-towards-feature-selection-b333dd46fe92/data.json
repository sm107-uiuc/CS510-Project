We need to reduce the number of features so that we can interpret the model better, make it less computational stressful to train the model, remove redundant effects and make the model generalise better. In some case feature selection becomes extremely important or else the input dimensional space is too big making it difficult for the model to train.", "Various ways to perform feature selection", "There are various ways to perform feature selection. I will enlist the ones I myself use in practice.", "Here I propose my creative take on how to perform feature selection using all the above favourite methods of mine instead of being hinged onto just one. The core idea is to combine correlation matrix (each variable compared wit the target variable), coefficient of linear regularised models and feature importance of various tree methods, combine them using randomly weighted average. Random weighing is used so that there is no inherent bias towards one kind of single approach. So, in the end, we have a final feature importance matrix having a mix of each of my favourite feature selection approaches in one go. It is always a nice thing to have a single output figure in front of us as compared to looking into various approaches.", "To display the proof of concept I will be using the Boston Housing Dataset. It is a regression case and all the input variables are continuous.", "2. Select Lasso and Ridge for computing coefficient of variable.", "3. Select GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor and ExtraTreeRegressor for computing feature importance. In practise before this step all transformations of categorical variables should be done (for instance either using one hot encoding or label encoding).", "4. Use numpy for random sampling to give weights to each approach and the take the weighted average.", "Here we have used a random weight generation scheme where we don\u2019t 0 for any form of feature selection mechanism and the value or weights are in steps of 0.1 for simplicity.", "5. Then we return combined result which can be visualised using bar plot.", "There are various other feature selection techniques out there as well but this one which I presented can give a very different view to compare the relevance of feature towards the target variable using a kind of ensemble of my favourite feature selection techniques. You can fiddle around with various parameters and be more creative with this very idea. One can also use the model with few more specific setting such as using the trees model objects initialised with some specific value of n_estimators or max_depth according to specific use cases but here just to showcase the idea I used default model object.", "This thought process is not only beneficial for coming to a final one shot feature importance output but also we can visually see the numbers and plots to compare how different methods perform independently and then make an informed decision regarding the choice of input variables.", "Like Einstein famously said I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am.", "Your home for data science.
