We were able to see how these methods can be used to reduce the number of features in our data. However, they are linear methods: they do not always perform well when there are nonlinear relationships within our data.", "This is where manifold learning comes in. A manifold is any space that is locally Euclidean. To put it simply, you can think of it as any object that is nearly \u201cflat\u201d on a small scale. For example, the Earth is round but it looks flat to us. The Earth is a manifold: locally it is flat, but globally we know it is a sphere. Then, manifold learning performs dimensionality reduction by representing data as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a higher-dimensional space.", "In this article, I will introduce two manifold learning algorithms: Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). They both have ready-to-use implementations on scikit-learn which can be useful for your projects, but for the purpose of this article, I will show how you can implement these methods from scratch.", "I will provide code snippets throughout the article, and you can find the full code as well as the example dataset on Github.", "For demonstration purposes, I perform dimensionality reduction on a set of handwritten images of the number 5. Each image is of size 28x28, and before applying the algorithms, we reshape the data to obtain 1D vectors of size 784. To begin, here is the 2D projection using PCA:", "We can see this projection group images with similar features in space to a certain degree: on the x-axis, the images on the left side have thicker lines while the images on the right have finer lines. On the y-axis, the images on the top are more upright, or slightly skewed towards the left, while the images on the bottom are skewed towards the right.", "Isomap is a manifold learning method based on spectral theory to preserve geodesic distances. Isomap can be understood as an extension of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS): classic MDS performs principal coordinates analysis, basically PCA on a distance matrix instead of the covariance matrix, based on pairwise Euclidean distances between data points. Isomap uses the geodesic distance instead, which is the distance of the shortest path between data points.", "First, here is a simple code that provides the steps for Isomap: compute the distance matrix of the dataset, obtain the shortest paths matrix and apply MDS on it.", "The distance matrix can be calculated from the input dataset as below, where we use Euclidean distance.", "Now, we will implement MDS. For MDS, it is important to first double-center the input distance matrix. The double-centering operation does not change distances between any pair of points, but allows the resulting matrix to have properties that simplify subsequent operations.", "Next, like in PCA, we compute the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the centered distance matrix.", "Then, we choose the two principal components by selecting the eigenvectors with the two largest eigenvalues and we obtain the subspace transform matrix W of shape 784 x 2 that will be used for the projection.", "Here is what we obtain applying Isomap to our example data:", "In the above result, we can observe that the projection has a \u201cU\u201d shape, and the variations in the images seem to follow this \u201cU\u201d shape. This is because Isomap looks for a nonlinear manifold, which is why it is able to detect the underlying existing curve.", "The top-left extremity has a rounder shape and the bottom half of the \u201c5\u201d is large, while on the top-right extremity, the bottom half of \u201c5\u201d is smaller. Unlike the PCA projection, it does not seem to separate the numbers with thinner or thicker lines.", "Also, inspecting different areas of this projection, the images seem to look more similar to each of their neighbors, unlike the PCA projection where images that do not have similar shapes can lie next to each other. The PCA projection, being a linear reduction, is maybe good at picking up on linear correlations such as between the pixel values and the thickness of the line, but the Isomap projection may find meaningful correlations that are not linear.", "Locally-linear embedding (LLE) is another manifold learning algorithm. The idea behind LLE is to compute a set of weights to describe each data point as a linear combination of its neighbors. Then, similarly to the previous methods, it uses an eigenvector-based optimization technique to find the low-dimensional embedding such that the relations of linear combinations between points and its neighbors are preserved.", "We begin LLE by computing the distance matrix as we have done before, except that this time, we are interested in the points that are the nearest neighbors of each data point.", "Next, LLE finds the weight matrix W that minimizes the following cost function:", "This function is simply the sum of errors between each point X_i and its reconstruction from its neighbors X_j. We can implement this part using the FastLLE algorithm like below.", "Here is the output of dimensionality reduction using LLE:", "The LLE projection gives an even sharper \u201cV\u201d shape than the ICA projection, we may even consider this representation somewhat distorted compared to the previous Isomap projection. This is because LLE is a local method whereas Isomap is a global method, so LLE has more tendency to distort the projection space while Isomap is more stable.", "It is also interesting to notice that in both the LLE and Isomap projections, the point that is far from the general cluster corresponds to the same image. Both methods identify the same data point that indeed does not look like the rest of the \u201c5\u201ds, and project them in a space far from the rest, as we can see below.", "I hope you enjoyed my article, thanks for your interest!
