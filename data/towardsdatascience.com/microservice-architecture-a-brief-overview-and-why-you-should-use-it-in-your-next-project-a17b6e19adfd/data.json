In 1964, a general-purpose programming language BASIC was developed. It lowers the barrier so that non-PhD students from all departments can also write programs. As there was a rapid growth of computing applications in the 1960s, software became large and complex. Computer Scientists tried to tackle the complexity of Software Systems with the ancient and proven technique: Divide and Conquer.", "David Parnas published his seminal paper \u201cOn the Criteria to be used in decomposing Systems into Modules\u201d in 1972 which introduced the concepts of Modularity and Information hiding. Also, Edsger W. Dijkstra introduced the concept Separation of Concern in his paper \u201cOn the role of scientific thought\u201d published in 1974. The works of Parnas, Dijkstra and others lead to the rise of Modular Software Development in the 1970s with the principal of decomposing a large, complex software system into \u201cLoosely coupled, highly cohesive\u201d modules which communicated via internal interfaces. In simple terms, \u201cloosely coupled\u201d means the dependency between modules should be very low and \u201chighly cohesive\u201d means that one module should focus on single or similar functionality. With the rise of the Internet and Web in the 1990s, software systems became widespread in business applications and became even more complex and large. Although Modularity is used to reduce the complexities of software application, it often did not help as the soft Modular boundaries of software sub-systems are easy to cross and misuse. Another Software Architecture pattern became very popular during the 1990s to develop business applications: Layered Architecture. Normally, a business Web Application is divided into several layers: Presentation, Business, Database layers.", "In 1997, Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder has analyzed many Business applications and published the \u201cBig Ball of Mud\u201d papers. The paper states", "that most of the Business applications suffer from the following problems:", "In the late 2000s, a Cambrian Explosion happens in the software industries due to the rise of Mobile Internet (Wifi, Smartphone) and faster network. Also, software started to eat the world where along with the traditional Software/Technology companies, almost all types of companies started to develop or use software like Banking, Insurance, Restaurants, Hotels, Music, Driving, etc. Many new companies like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Netflix, Spotify came with innovative ideas, aggressive strategy, move fast approach which leads to the exponential growth of their applications. Suddenly, Organizations and Software Engineers found that Monolithic Architecture cannot handle the challenges of Modern, Fast-Paced or Web-Scale Software development.", "In the 2010s, other disruptive technologies arise which impact the Software Development landscape in a significant way: Cloud Computing, Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), DevOps. Likewise some highly productive, lightweight new programming languages e.g. Golang, Rust, Swift come to the scenario whereas some highly productive, easy to use, lightweight programming language like JavaScript, Python become mainstream. There is a change in Software Development model also. Waterfall software development model is almost discarded and replaced by fast, iterative, incremental Software development methodology: Agile Software development. Computer Hardware also changed massively with cheaper, faster main memory and rise of Multi-Core CPU, GPU. There was a change in the Data Storage landscape as well. New Database technologies like NoSQL, NewSQL emerges and become mainstream", "To handle the complexity of modern software applications, to take the advantages of Cloud Computing, Containerization, DevOps, modern Programming languages and to fulfill the need of modern software development (fast development, horizontal scaling), a new Software Architecture Style arose in 2012: Microservice Architecture. So, what is exactly a Microservice Architecture? There are many definitions of Microservice Architecture and here is my definition:", "Microservice Architecture is about decomposing a Software System into autonomus Units which are independently deployable and which communicates via lightweight, language agnostic way and together they fulfill the business goal.", "Microservice Architecture also uses the same technique of divide and conquer to tackle the complexity of software systems like Modular Monolithic architecture where a complex Software system is divided into many Microservices which communicates via external Interfaces. The key difference between Modular Monolithic and Microservice Architecture is that every Microservice can be deployed independently whereas all Modules usually are deployed as a whole (deployment Monolith). As shown in the", "image above, Monolithic application is one single unit (tightly coupled) like a single Cube. Modular application is like Rubric Cube which can contain small modules but the modules cannot be separated and can only be deployed together. Microservices are like a lego cube made by lego blocks where the blocks are loosely coupled, easily separable and all the lego blocks together made the cube.", "As like anything in life, Microservice Architecture has also its price and a fair share of disadvantages. It is by no means a Golden Hammer which can solve all sort of Problems in a Software Application or in the Organization. It is no surprise that fellow Microservice expert Sam Newman has started his highly acclaimed book \u201cBuilding Microservices\u201d with a scenario where moving to Microservice Architecture from Monolithic Architecture without proper architecture/consideration which leads to the nightmarish condition. There are also some Blog posts like \u201cGoodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar\u201d or \u201cThe Death of Microservice Madness in 2018\u201d where the writers discussed the great number of ordeals and pains they suffered to move from Monolith to Microservice Architecture. Here are some disadvantages of Microservice Architecture:", "It is true that designing and implementing Microservice Architecture is challenging and needs a Paradigm Shift compared to Monolithic Software Architecture. Similarly, Microservice Architecture is by no means a Silver Bullet which can solve the Complexity issues of all sorts of applications. On the other hand, it is by no means a Hype Driven Development or Cargo Cult. Considering everything, I believe Microservice Architecture is a very useful and handy tool for modern Software Development. For large Enterprises which normally develop complex Softwares, Microservice Architecture is the only way to tackle complexity and to be competitive in the market. For small to medium enterprises also, Microservice Architecture should be used for sustainable software development which can give long term benefits. It is worth noting that the early adopters of Microservice Architecture (Spotify, Netflix, Linkedin, Amazon, Google) achieved significant competitive advantages over rivals thanks to their Microservice Architecture.", "If you found this helpful, please share it on your favorite forums (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn).
