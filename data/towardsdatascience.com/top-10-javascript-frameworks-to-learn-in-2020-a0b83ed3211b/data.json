There are many excellent JavaScript frameworks, whereas new JavaScript frameworks are coming almost every day.", "If you want to start your career in JavaScript development or if you are an experienced JavaScript developer and now want to level up your tech skills, then which framework should you learn? Here I am listing the most important JavaScript frameworks based on the following criteria:", "Also, I will include frameworks for both front-end and back-end development.", "I have added pure JavaScript frameworks in this list, with the exceptions of React and Node.js. React is a library that implements only the view layer. But in reality, React Core library is a part of the whole React eco-systems, which includes other React libraries (e.g., React Router) and third-party libraries. Also, well-reputed websites like \u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d and \u201cStack Overflow Developer Survey\u201d have put React in the Web framework category. I also feel that without including the most essential Web framework/library, I can only give a partial view of the JavaScript landscape. Furthermore, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime and not a framework. But Node.js offers a complete Eco-system of JavaScript-based Back-end development, and many rankings (e.g., \u201cStack Overflow Developer Survey\u201d) usually put Node.js in the Back-end framework category with Ruby on Rails, Django, PHP Laravel. I know some purists may not like it, and I will get backlash to include React and Node.js in this list. But to draw a full picture of the JavaScript landscape, I made the conscious choice to have React and Node.js in this list.", "React is not among the earliest disruptive JavaScript-based Web frameworks. But it is the most disruptive and influential JavaScript-based Web framework. Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook Engineers created React in 2013 as a Component-based Web Framework with one-way data flow and changed the Front-end Web Development forever. It also introduced many other concepts like functional, declarative programming, immutable state, which was uncommon in Front-end development. The other breakthrough of React was to introduce the Virtual DOM, which gives better user experience and performance gain.", "Today, React is by far the most dominant Web frameworks with no sign of slipping up soon.", "With 8 million downloads per week, React is by far the most downloaded Front-end JavaScript frameworks. Also, NPM trends from the last five years shows that React is the clear winner among the Front-end frameworks with a massive lead over other frameworks:", "It is the second most starred JavaScript frameworks in GitHub with the second-highest number of Contributors:", "\u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d survey has placed React in top position in terms of satisfaction and awareness:", "The StackOverflow developer Survey 2019 has ranked React as the second most used framework in Web development:", "It was also the most loved front-end framework in 2019:", "Although there were several attempts to use JavaScript in Server-side development, they were not very popular. In 2009, Ryan Dahl created the asynchronous, event-driven Server-Side JavaScript runtime Node.js and brought JavaScript in the uncharted territory of Back-end development. Ryan Dahl has used the popular JavaScript Engine V8 and C++ libraries. Since then, the popularity of both Node.js and JavaScript has skyrocketed. With Node Package Manager NPM and countless numbers of frameworks/libraries, Node.js has surpassed many other established Server-side frameworks. Because of its Asynchronous Event-Driven nature and lightweight, fast runtime, Node.js is especially suited for I/O heavy applications like Web, IoT, Serverless.", "Today, Node.js is not a framework rather than an entire Eco-system of Server-Side JavaScript development. With many innovations (like NPM, Module Systems), Node.js is one of the primary driving force to improve JavaScript as a programming language and to increase the popularity of JavaScript.", "Although Node.js is the third most starred JavaScript project, it has the highest number of contributors in GitHub:", "StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019 has put Node.js in the top position in other framework categories:", "Also, Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 has placed Node.js as the 6th most loved framework:", "From the last ten years of Google Trends data, it is evident that Node.js has surpassed and overtaken other popular Server Side frameworks like PHP Laravel, Django, and ASP.NET.", "In modern days where Web frameworks are backed by Giant Tech companies, Vue.js is an exception. In 2014, an ex-Google Engineer Evan You decided to combine the good parts of AngularJS (View Layer) and the good parts of React (Virtual DOM) and created Vue.js. Today, Vue.js is one of the most popular JavaScript-based Web frameworks. One of the key design goals of Evan You was to lower the barrier into JavaScript-based front-end development. Vue.js is one of the easiest Front-end frameworks where developers can write SPA applications with minor effort.", "Developers can use Vue.js as an End-to-End framework with Routing, State management like Angular, or as only a view layer like React. It also offers Angular like two-way data-binding with additional Reactivity and React like rendering using Virtual DOM.", "Vue.js is the most starred GitHub project, as shown below:", "Vue.js is experiencing high adoption in the industry of late, which is evident from the high number of downloads in NPM and caught up Angular:", "Vue.js ranked 7th among all Web Frameworks according to the StackOverflow Developer survey 2019:", "Also, StackOverflow developer survey 2019 has ranked Vue.js as the second most loved Web framework:", "\u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d survey has placed Vue.js in the second spot in terms of interest:", "In AngularJS, Google had created one of the earliest hot JavaScript-based Front-end frameworks in 2010. But once Facebook released React, it exposed the design flaws of AngularJS, and it quickly became an outdated framework. As a result, the Google team has created an entirely new SPA framework and released it as Angular in 2016. Although Angular and AngularJS have similar names, in reality, they are two different frameworks. Unlike React, it is an end-to-end Framework with \u201cOut-of-the-box\u201d support of everything one needs to develop an Enterprise-grade Web App. Also, Angular is the first significant framework that has embraced TypeScript and played a considerable role in making TypeScript popular.", "Today, Angular is lagging React, Vue.js, or Svelte in terms of hype and interest. But it is a proven and reliable Enterprise Grade framework that will be in the community for years to come.", "If we consider GitHub stars, then it is the 4th most popular JavaScript framework as shown below:", "Angular has made up its lack of popularity with a massive adoption in the industry as it leads the highly popular Vue.js in terms of NPM downloads:", "StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019 ranked Angular in the 3rd position among all Web Frameworks:", "According to \u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d survey 2019, Angular ranked the second spot in terms of awareness:", "When Node.js appeared in 2009, TJ Holowaychuk has created Express.js based on the minimalistic Web Framework Sinatra. It is a minimalistic Web framework to develop Web application and REST API. It is also less opinionated and very fast. Many other JavaScript-based Web frameworks are based on Express.", "Today, Express.js is the most popular JavaScript-based Web application framework hands down.", "It is the most popular JavaScript-based back-end framework as evident by GitHub stars:", "With over 10 million downloads every week, Express.js is by far the most downloaded JavaScript framework:", "The \u201cState of JavaScript\u201d survey has ranked Express.js as the top JavaScript server-side framework for three consecutive years (2017, 2018, 2019):", "The StackOverflow Developer survey 2019 has ranked Express as 5th most popular Web framework and most popular JavaScript back-end framework in 2019:", "React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core just offers the view layer. There was always a need for an end-to-end, opinionated framework based on React. Tim Neutkens and a group of Software Engineers from the Dutch company Zeit has created Next.js as an end-to-end, higher-level Web Framework on top of React and Node.js. Next.js offers both Server-Rendered and Static Web sites for Web, Desktop, and Mobile devices.", "In terms of GitHub stars, it is the 6th most popular JavaScript framework and second most popular JavaScript back-end framework:", "The popularity of Next.js is soaring over the past few years, as shown by an increasing number of downloads:", "According to \u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d 2019, Next.js as the second most satisfying JavaScript back-end framework for two consecutive years (2018, 2019):", "In 2012, a group of Engineers had created Meteor as an isomorphic, open-source full-stack JavaScript framework based on Node.js. It also supports building end-to-end applications for Web, Mobile, Desktop platform and integrates well with popular front-end frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte. It is also a \u201cBatteries Included\u201d framework with \u201cOut-of-the-box\u201d support for Enterprise-grade App development.", "According to the number of GitHub stars, it is the 7th most popular JavaScript framework:", "The \u201cState of JavaScript\u201d survey has ranked Meteor as the 7th most popular JavaScript framework albeit with diminishing popularity:", "In 2016, a Guardian Software Engineer Rich Harris had the groundbreaking idea to develop a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific Runtime and released Svelte. The idea was to use the Svelte compiler, which would compile framework-specific code to plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and render the compiled code to the browser. Although the concept was not new in software development, it was uncharted territory in Front-end development. The other significant contribution of Svelte is to add first-class support of reactivity, which leads to faster, improved performance without Virtual DOM. Today, it is arguably the hottest Front-end framework with tremendous traction and interest in the industry.", "Svelte is only getting popular since its version 2 release in 2018 and ranked 8th in terms of GitHub stars:", "Svelte is seeing an increasing number of adoptions in the industry over the last couple of years, as evident from NPM Trends:", "The community and industry are showing high interest in Svelte, which is apparent as \u201cThe State of JavaScript\u201d survey ranked Svelte in top position in terms of interest:", "In 2013, the core members of Express.js led by TJ Holowaychuk had created Koa as a lightweight, modern, expressive, and robust middleware framework for Web Applications and APIs.
