I was amazed by the fact that the price of bitcoin was at an all time high with a value of $19,783. It was hard for me to suppress this euphoric feeling. This feeling did not stem from how amazed I was by how high the price of bitcoin was but it was by how the line plot perfectly depicts how it managed to grow rapidly. This is the same feeling I get whenever I see a chart that impeccably describes numbers.", "On a daily basis, I come across data presented in visually appealing formats that explain what the numbers mean and give me insights on what to do with this information. The more I got interested in these graphs/charts, the more I got attracted to data visualization. Data Visualization is the field of study that deals with capturing data with the aim of effectively displaying them so that anyone can easily make inferences about datasets at a quick glance.", "Data Visualization is one of the major pillars of Data Science. It uses shapes, lines and other figurative approaches to portray numbers. There are multiple techniques that can be used to present data based on what kind of data is available. This article shall focus on five of them which are: bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, histogram and line chart.", "Bar Chart is an aspect of data visualization that presents categorical data\u2019s numerical values as bars in order to compare data points with one another. It does this by increasing or decreasing the size of the bar based on how big or small the numbers. There are two types of bar chart: horizontal bar chart and vertical bar chart.", "Horizontal bar charts are better at presenting data in either an ascending or descending order. Vertical bar charts are better at presenting data without using a sequential numeric order especially when only one data point matters.", "A pie chart is a chart that compares the magnitude of how different data point contributes to a whole. Each data point has a percentage that can be represented like a slice of pie which adds up to a full pie. That\u2019s why it is called pie chart. The bigger the percentage, the bigger the slice and vice versa. All the percentages add up to 100%.", "In the above pie chart, there is a circle with all the percentages adding up to 100%. To its right, there is a legend for all the labels of the slices.", "A scatter plot is a plot that compares two numerical sets of values of two variables with one another. It places the numbers of one of the variables on the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the other on the vertical axis (y-axis). Then, it plots data points as symbols where the numerical values of the data point intersect on the graphs.", "After plotting these symbols, further calculations can be carried out to measure the strength of the relationships of the two variables. This is done using the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A negative value signifies that they have an inverse relationship i.e as x increases, y decreases and vice versa. A positive value signifies that they have a direct relationship i.e as x increases, y increases. The closer the correlation coefficient is to |1|, the more perfect it is.", "Another useful ability of the scatter plot is to create a regression line. By creating an equation that uses the independent variables on the x-axis to predict the dependent variables on the y-axis, a regression line is built.", "A histogram is a graphing mechanism used to count the number of times a numerical value appears in a given data set. It does this by grouping the numerical values into different groups within a fixed width of certain numbers. It counts the number of times the numerical values in each group appears and utilizes a bar to present its frequency. The more frequent the numerical values in a group is, the bigger the bar.", "The graph above is a normally skewed data because most of the data sits right in the middle. This suggests that mean=median=mode. If most of the data are on the left side of the graph, it is called positively skewed, implying that mode<median<mean. If most of the data are on the right side of the graph, it is called negatively skewed, implying that mode>median>mean. The biggest bar is called the mode because it consists of the highest frequently occurring numerical values.", "A line chart is a chart that is mostly used to show how a certain variable has changed over a period of time. It does this by plotting time on the x-axis and plotting the variable on the y-axis. It connects preceding data points with following data points using lines.", "The power of data visualization is evident in our modern world. Politicians, sports\u2019 pundits, journalists, engineers and accountants use data visualization techniques to convey comprehensive important messages to people with a better idea of what is going on.", "Your home for data science.
