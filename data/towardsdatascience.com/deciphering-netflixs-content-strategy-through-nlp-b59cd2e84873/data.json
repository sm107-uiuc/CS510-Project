The practices of social distancing and quarantining are making us spend more time at home which we would have otherwise spent either commuting to work on weekdays or going to malls on weekends.", "As someone who enjoys watching movies, I decided to spend my time during the lockdown watching 1\u20132 movies every evening on Netflix. As I sip my coffee and scroll through the titles on Netflix, I realized I spend an awful lot of time deciding which movie I would like to watch. I usually search 15\u201320 titles by genres and read their description before zoning in on a movie. Given the plethora of choices on Netflix, don\u2019t we all spend a lot of time figuring out which movie to watch? While I kept searching for movies, still unsure which movie to pick, I wondered if the whole content team of Netflix addresses the same question every day: Which content would I pick for my subscribers?", "For a streaming platform such as Netflix, content would be one of the most important strategic levers to increase its paid subscriber base. A quick glance at the Netflix\u2019s 2019Q4 financial statements reveal that its paid subscriber base stands at whopping 167 million users. (See Fig1 below)", "If all the paid subscribers of Netflix formed a country, say Republic of Netflix, it would be the 9th most populous country in the world, just losing the 8th spot to Bangladesh by a million.", "Furthermore, interestingly 2018Q4 has seen a surge in trial users to 9.2 million users, followed by an increase in its 2019Q1 paid subscriber base by 9.6 million users. Did most of those trial users become paid users creating a peak for paid users in 2019Q1?", "While the trial users have been decreasing every quarter in 2019, the paid net additional users are increasing from 2019Q2 to 2019Q4. Are users directly creating paid accounts without a trial period!? Without user-level data, it is difficult to answer these questions.", "How did the content spend per subscriber change over the quarters vis-a-vis\u2019 the revenue per subscriber?", "The revenue and marketing spends are mentioned in the historical segments section of the 2019Q4 financial statements. The calculation for content spend is a little bit calculated due to different types of content that Netflix streams.", "The account treatment document as of Jan-2018 mentions that content spend is to be calculated as Addition to streaming content assets + Change in streaming content liabilities.", "The following table gives you a snap-shot of the financials in terms of paid user additions, Revenues, Content spends and Marketing spend for each of the last 12 quarters.", "To explain the aforementioned fall of content spend per user in 2019Q1 , let\u2019s take look at the relationship between total content spend and the net paid user additions every quarter. In 2019Q1, the content spending decreased for the first time and the paid new additional users was at a all-time high in last 12 quarters. This explains why content spend per user was at a all time-low in last 12 quarters.", "But the content spend every quarter has been increasing consistently by ~7% till 2018Q4. In 2019Q1, they reduced the content spend by 15% ~ $500 million dollars. In the next quarter, 2019Q2, the number of paid net user additions fell drastically from 9.6 million to 2.7 million. Looks like the content spend in the last quarter might have an influence on the net paid user additions in the next quarter, 2019Q2.", "I computed the above metrics just to check if there are any major shifts in content spending and we figured that 2019Q2 saw such a shift. I am pretty sure that most of the stock analysts who track Netflix are busy right now with content analysis from its financial statements to prepare for the upcoming earnings announcement on 21st April, 2020. However, I am more interested to explore the content choices that Netflix made over the years, rather than content spend/financial metrics. As the content choices it made not only delighted its 89 million users as of 2016Q4, but also resulted in an increase of 78 million paid users in the next three years ( including me!).", "\u201cWhen we please our members, they watch more and we grow more\u201d \u2014 Netflix 2019Q1 letter to shareholders", "So what content has Netflix been adding to please its users?", "More I grappled with the above question, the more I wanted to figure an approach to answer that question. As chance would have it, I stumbled upon an excellent article in the Netflix Tech Blog section which elaborates how Netflix relies on predictive data-modeling for assessing its content consumption across languages. I think it is a great blog for anyone who is passionate about both movies and analytics. Given such an emphasis on data-driven decisions to figure out both the content and its creation life-cycle, I surmise those decisions should surface as patterns in the titles that it adds to its platform. I decided to put this additional time during the COVID-19 lockdown period to learn a bit of NLP(natural-language-processing) and check if I can apply any basic NLP techniques to figure out the choices that Netflix made with regard to its content. Since Netflix relies on consumer level data to arrive at those choices, we can maybe uncover a few customer preferences along the way.", "To explore this, I looked at two data sources to triangulate its content strategy \u2014", "(1) : Content section in its quarterly letter to shareholders- Every quarter Netflix releases its letter to shareholders where it publishes a section on content. In this section, Netflix communicates about its content choices, reasons and how they fared in that quarter.", "(2) List of actual titles that Netflix has on its platform. The above data source is top-down approach in terms of what Netflix communicates about its content strategy . Using the titles on Netflix and their description, the actual content strategy could be deciphered.", "Data source: I used the dataset from kaggle.com, which is primarily based on the data collected from the website flixable.com. Flixable contains all the TV Shows and Movies currently available to stream on Netflix in the United States.", "The above dataset does not classify the content into three types of content that Netflix classifies. In this article, we will not classify the content choices by self-produced titles, branded and licensed titles and only licensed titles.", "Upon merging both the financial dataset and the Kaggle dataset, I find that 2018Q2 has highest content spend to acquire a title \u2014 $8.6 million dollars and 2019Q1 has lowest content spend of $5.6 million to acquire a title.", "Before, I dive into processing the texts from both the data sets, a big shout out to the \u201cText Mining with R\u201d by Julia Silge and David Robinson. I found the content on this super helpful to learn text mining and to plot the below charts.", "Analysing the content section of its letter to shareholders (top-down)", "To understand the key themes that Netflix uses in its content section, I collected the content sections from the letter to shareholders that Netflix publishes to its investors. I compiled the data for the last 30 quarters ( 2012Q3 to 2019Q4). From this dataset, I extracted bigram tokens, after removing stopwords, from the text to create a network visualisation of bigrams from the corpus. The below graph creates a network structure of bigrams (two word combination). Say, \u201cla\u201d+ \u201ccasa\u201d = \u201cla casa\u201d is a bigram and \u201ccase de\u201d is another bigram. Both bigrams are joined at the node \u201ccasa\u201d forming a network structure \u201c la casa de\u201d.", "I have grouped the above bigrams into broad theme categories. Lets look at the key themes that Netflix communicated to its shareholders:", "When I plot the common bigrams in three year windows, 2017\u20132019 and 2014\u20132016, there are a few shifts in content focus, apart from key trends mentioned above.", "In the recent years, there is more emphasis on drama, limited series, extending seasons and of course, original content. Less emphasis on comedy series, TV networks and internet TV", "Triangulating what they said with what they did\u2026.", "Analysing all the titles and their description on Netflix ( Bottom-up approach)", "Kaggle dataset (second data set in the above data description) contains the information on titles gathered for the last 12 years, from 2008 to 18 January,2020. The fields in the dataset are as follows:title\u2019s name, type (TV show or movie), director, cast, countries involved in the production, date added on Netflix, original release year, rating (MPAA or TV Parental Guidelines), duration of the title, listed in category, and a brief description of the title. I used the description of the title to extract its key content choices and listed_in category to extract the genres.", "Based on the date added, I have added the quarters to the dataset to study what type (movies/ tv shows), genres and themes are being added every quarter. As of Jan\u20192020, the dataset shows that Netflix has about a total of 6234 titles. 68%(4265) of which are movies and the rest of 1969 titles are classified as TV shows", "Lets\u2019s take a quick look of the split of titles added every quarter from 2016Q1 to 2020Q1*( till Jan 18, 2020). While Netflix is adding increasingly more titles every quarter, % of movies seems to follow a cyclical pattern. ( See Fig 10 below)", "Well that\u2019s about the count of titles, lets look at top genres from the data", "Most of us have a preference towards a few genres. While some may like adventure, action, crime, thrillers etc., others might prefer romance, comedy or family movies. While we are browsing for titles, most of us would probably anchor our search by genre. So, I picked genre as an important variable to figure out how Netflix adds its movies and tv shows. Every title is usually classified in about 2\u20133 genres. So I extracted tokens as words, after removing stop-words, from the listed_in column in the dataset to understand what are the top genres under which the titles that were added every year are listed.", "The above figure (Fig6) depicts the count of titles added in 2019 by genre and by type ( movie or TV show). Top 5 genres are exactly the same for both movies and TV shows", "2018 and 2017 exhibit almost same genre-patterns except for a couple of changes-", "How does the overall Netflix genre-distribution look like?", "Can I use the above data (Fig14) to search better from 6234 titles on Netflix? While Netflix curates content for you in \u201cPopular picks\u201d and \u201cTrending picks for you\u201d based on your search choices, you can still use the above data to search genre-combos better.", "Here\u2019s a tip to browse genre combinations - A title on Netflix is usually classified in 2\u20133 genres. So, next time when you are browsing for titles on Netflix by genre-combo, you can narrow your search by selecting the less frequent genre from the above list and scroll for the more frequent genre tag. For example, if you want to watch horror-thrillers movies and you do not want to type 15\u201316 characters using your remote, browse through the horror row ( you will first have a narrower set of horror titles in the rows) and then look for thrillers in the labels of titles in that row..", "There are genres and then, there are stories that draw audiences to your content. Themes or plot-lines are important hooks for audiences to engage with the content. Similar to the approach I took for analysing the letters to shareholders, I extracted tokens as bigrams, after removing stop-words, from the description column in the dataset. These bigrams are representation of the themes of the titles that are added every year. Let me pick a few movies and shows from the dataset to illustrate how the descriptions are worded in the data-set.", "Rocky: Sylvester Stallone shot to fame as Rocky Balboa, an unknown fighter who\u2019s given a shot at fighting world champ Apollo Creed as a publicity stunt.", "Rocky II: Featuring a rousing climax, this engaging sequel finds boxer Rocky Balboa returning to the ring for a rematch against reigning champ Apollo Creed.", "Stranger things: When a young boy vanishes, a small town uncovers a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one strange little girl.", "Using the above title descriptions, I stringed together all the bigrams and removed the stop words to create a network map of the bigrams for all the movie and TV show titles respectively. From the network maps ( Fig 15 and Fig 16), I broadly identify the following theme categories-", "Classifying the bigrams into these themes is a judgement call I took. The bigrams which do not have a theme are famous stars or shows. There are a total of 8 categories that I have classified the bigrams into. See the legend on the left.", "What are the top bigrams in the above theme categories?", "Common to both movies and TV shows- single mother, free-spirited", "Bar charts in Fig 12 presents all the above bigrams classified by Move/TV show and sorted in descending order of frequency. The top themes are as follows:", "True Stories , Documentaries, World War II, Martial Arts, New York city, Los Angeles , police officer, true love are common themes/bigrams for both movies and TV shows on Netflix", "In the appendix, you can find the year-on-year frequency plots of bigrams for last four years (2016\u20132019). The above themes more or less appear, abeit in a slightly different order across the years.", "So, if I were to ever pen a story that would end up on Netflix, I would go with the the below prompt that with the following title description . I came up with the following prompt using the key themes that are common to both movies and TV shows", "The prompt has all the key themes that frequently appear in the Netflix title descriptions. If the content on Netflix is a good reflection of its subscriber preferences, then the above theme would probably appeal to the audiences. However to be certain, it merits further exploration of which themes drive box office performance or user engagement.", "What Netflix told its shareholders about its content?", "In the last thirty quarters, Netflix has always emphasised creating original contents and highlighted its hit series ( original and licensed both, breaking bad etc.) and top comedy stars. They mentioned releases of follow-on seasons such as season2, season3 and returning seasons often as a mark of acceptance and engagement with its audiences. They emphasised a lot on variety in content and appealing to diverse tastes of its audience. They brought Latin America and North America content onto platform and communicated the same to shareholders. And, of course, they always mention awards ( academy awards, golden globes, emmy) as a signal of quality of content to its subscribers and shareholders.", "What Netflix gave its subscribers in terms of content in the last three years?", "2019 saw an additional focus on TV shows compared to movies. While the titles added every quarter increase, Percentage of titles with movies on platform decreased from 76% in 2017Q1 to 65% in 2017Q3.", "Genres it focused on in the last three years:", "Themes of the content Netflix added in the last three years:", "(1) Documentaries/ True stories- quite a few true stories", "(2) Cities/Locations \u2014 Common locations for both movies and TV-New York, Los Angeles and Hongkong", "(3) Professions \u2014 Common profession in both TV and movies- Police officers, drug lords, college students and FBI agents", "(4) Actions- Common thing the characters do in both TV shows and movies- Cross paths and join forces.", "(5) Personal events \u2014 Common personal life event for both TV and movies- true love", "(6) Topics/Major events \u2014 Common to both TV show and Movies World War II, Hip hop, social media, martial arts", "(7) Personal Attributes- single mother, free-spirited", "(8) Title attributes \u2014 Award winning, comedy", "Based on Fig12, The top themes common to both TV shows and movies are: True Stories , Documentaries, World War II, Martial Arts, New York city, Los Angeles , police officer, true love are common themes/bigrams for both movies and TV shows on Netflix.", "So does this mean \u201clights, camera and action\u201d for any prompt with the above bigrams? Before any of producers, among the readers, get ready to bankroll this project, they might ask if the above prompt will be successful at box-office or expected to have great subscriber engagement? I will try to answer that in an other article by linking box office revenues to themes and genres. At this point of time, what we know are the content choices of Netflix in terms of genres and story themes.", "Happy reading!
