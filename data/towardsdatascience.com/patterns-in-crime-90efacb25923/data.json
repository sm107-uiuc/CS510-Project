Whether it\u2019s ensuring your door is locked when you leave the house, avoiding a rough neighbourhood or installing a security alarm, prevention of crime takes up a significant part of our lives. This is despite the fact that crime levels (in the UK) have fallen almost consistently for the past 25 years.", "In this article I will investigate an open dataset provided by UK police forces to uncover any interesting or surprising patterns, trends or anomalies.", "The data used here is openly available from the data.police.uk website and contains information on over 19m reported individual crime and anti-social behaviour in each of the 43 geographical police forces of England, Wales & NI (plus two special forces: the British Transport Police and the Ministry of Justice) from October 2016 to September 2019. This includes information on locations, dates, types of crime and most recent status of investigations. As per usual with my articles, analysis and visualisations are produced using R.", "The simplest way to visualise this data is look at the absolute numbers of crime over time:", "To visualise this cyclical pattern more clearly, we can stack the graph above for each year, to visualise across calendar months. See the graph below for the total number of crimes reported each calendar month across all 45 forces.", "Some factors which could be contributing to this pattern include:", "These graphs above disguise variations between different types of crime. Each reported crime in the UK is classified into one of 14 categories, such as \u2018Burglary\u2019, \u2018Drugs\u2019, or \u2018Violence and sexual offences\u2019. The full list of categories and explanations is available here.", "Below is a graph showing how the number of crimes for each category has changed over time.", "Note that in order to make the graph easier to read, I have combined the six categories with the fewest number of crimes (\u2018Drugs\u2019, \u2018Other Crime\u2019, \u2018Robbery\u2019, \u2018Possession of weapons\u2019, \u2018Theft from the person\u2019 and \u2018Bicycle theft\u2019) into a single \u2018Other\u2019 category. This is not to be confused with \u2018Other theft\u2019, which is a category that includes theft by an employee, blackmail and making off without payment.", "The data provided also gives geographic details on the reported crimes, including the LSOA (\u2018lower layer super output area\u2019). The UK has been divided geographically into over 34,000 LSOAs for statistical reporting purposes. They vary in size, with larger areas in rural locations and smaller catchment areas in city centres. Below you can see how these are split across England & Wales.", "You can see in some places, the LSOAs are so small that it appears to be a block of dark colour. This unintentionally results in a heat map of population density - as LSOAs tend to be smaller in densely populated areas.", "We can check this though, by including LSOA population density in the plot. The map below shows the population density (people per square kilometre) for each LSOA - the darker the colour, the more densely populated.", "Here we can see where the big cities of England & Wales are located, as well as the areas of the country that are most sparsely populated.", "98% of the crimes in our police data have an LSOA attached to them, so I can now combine the datasets for population and crime to visualise the per capita crime level in each LSOA. The resulting map can be seen below.", "It is immediately obvious that the map is not as useful as we\u2019d hope. There are a small number of LSOAs which have an extremely high level of crime and these are exclusively in city centres across the country (which also happen to be very small, so are hard to spot on the map).", "To give an idea of how vast this variation is, consider the following:", "The top 10 LSOAs in England & Wales for high crime rates were situated in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Cardiff & Gloucester - all of which are among the largest cities in the UK (with the exception of Gloucester and, arguably, Cardiff).", "It is perhaps unsurprising that cities suffer from higher crime rates - this is a well documented fact - but this will be the subject of separate blog post. The data I\u2019m using contains rough co-ordinates for each reported crime so will allow for some interesting mapping within some of the UK\u2019s biggest cities.", "The last thing to look at in order to tie all the themes of this article together is to investigate if there are differences in the most common type of crime across the country and whether there are any visible patterns.", "See below a map of the LSOAs again, with each coloured depending on which of the 14 categories of crime is the most common.", "As discussed earlier in the article, the two broadest types of crime (\u2018Anti-social behaviour\u2019 and \u2018Violence and sexual offences\u2019) are far more common than the rest and this is reflected in the map above where they are drowning out comparison of other types.", "To dig a bit deeper, we can remove these types of crime from the analysis, and examine the remaining data.", "A few more interesting conclusions can be made here:", "If you enjoyed then please do share this, follow and give Data Slice a follow to stay up to date with new articles!", "As I mentioned, there will be a follow-up article where I\u2019ll visualise crimes within cities - and answering some questions such as: are crimes more common in housing estates, industrial estates or retail parks? And does the presence of a police station affect crime in the local area? I\u2019ll also be investigating how successful investigations are into crime, comparing conviction rates across different locations, types of crime and times of the year.
