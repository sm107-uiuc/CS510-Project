Considering cases when the search tree is either too broad or too deep, these algorithms may spend a lot of time wandering in meaningless searching. So is it possible for us to add a bit sense of intelligence into our search algorithm? Can we have a rough estimation of the environment and integrate it into the model? The answer leads us to A* search.", "The big picture of A* is no different from first-search, while BFS takes breadth as a priority, DFS takes depth as a priority, A* also has its own priority \u2014 a combination of cost of the path plus our estimation(or heuristic).", "Suppose we are now at point A and about to move to point B, and the goal is point C. From A move to B there is a natural cost g(B) , which could be 1 in BFS. Different from BFS, here we add our ESTIMATION of another cost of the distance from B to C, and the cost of A* would be g(B) + h(B) .", "Clearly the advantage of A* is that we add extra information of the environment and if the heuristic is chosen correctly, it should give us better estimation of the true cost from the current node to goal. The problem is how to choose a good heuristic, let\u2019s get into an example.", "We will use the same example stated above:", "In the grid world, we start at the top left and find the path to bottom right. The heuristic we generate for each grid is straight forward \u2014 simply the smallest distance from each point to the goal. Notice that the heuristic must be admissible, which is saying that your heuristic must be smaller than the optimal path:", "where h(n) is our heuristic, and h^*(n) is the optimal. In reality, we surely don\u2019t know the optimal path, but we can have set some relax conditions to help us generate a heuristic that is absolutely smaller than the optimal one(in the case here, we simply ignore the blocks).", "The implementation is mostly the same as the first search we introduced above, the only difference lies in how we introduce the heuristic cost.", "Before expanding the tree, we set the initial cost f :", "And inside each loop, we updated heuristic cost for each sub-nodes:", "f is added as the first element so that the open list can always explore the node with the lowest cost.", "where the -1 is the area the algorithm didn\u2019t search, see how the algorithm was able to avoid the vast number of nodes on the top right part. As the heuristic added extra cost for the algorithm to explore them, they were not prioritised in the end.", "A* search is optimal if the heuristic is admissible.", "Admissible makes that whichever node you expand, it makes sure that the current estimate is always smaller than the optimal, so path about to expand maintains a chance to find the optimal path. Consider the simplest heuristic of the above example, making all values in the heuristic to be 0, the algorithm turns to be breadth-first search which provides the optimal solution. But still the closer the heuristic to the optimal true value, the more efficient the algorithm can be, thinking that if we have a heuristic gives exactly the optimal estimation of each node, then the algorithm will directly follow the right path to the goal with minimum expansion.", "Your home for data science.
