These are also called voice bots, especially when delivered through a voice-only interface. For example, interactive voice response (IVR) systems as customer support voice bots.", "Siri was the first famous voice assistant. Then came Alexa in Amazon Echo devices which, among other things, made it possible to buy things Amazon. The next entrant was Google Assistant. It first came as Google Home devices and later in Android phones.", "It progressed from being amusing to being useful, even if in a closed and limited ecosystem.", "The next logical progression was to make it available in apps.

Almost all apps have some kind of search:", "Though all are a kind of search, each works with a different category of world knowledge.", "Voice Actions in apps have serious limitations. The voice journey ends as soon as it starts. Once the assistant invokes an app, users can interact with the app only through touch. That prevents building rich voice experiences suitable for an app.", "That\u2019s why several apps built a Voice Assistant inside the app (instead of their app hidden behind Alexa or Google Assistant). Gaana, YouTube, Paytm Travel, My Jio, Jio Mart, Amazon, and Flipkart apps have optimized Voice Assistants for their domain.", "Building these optimized assistants requires deep pockets.

It makes it easier to start building applications.", "All major cloud infrastructure provides have SaaS for speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech for some Indic languages.", "These services are quite expensive (just as payment gateways were). Having more SaaS providers using these pre-trained models can bring the cost down.", "SDKs in popular programming languages and OS platforms form the final layer. SDKs can use the models or SaaS.", "Tuning a model or service for an application domain requires some ASR and NLU expertise.
