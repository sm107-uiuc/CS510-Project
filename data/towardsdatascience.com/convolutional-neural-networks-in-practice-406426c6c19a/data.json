If you want to explore their theoretical fundamentals, I encourage you to check this article out.", "In this first example, we will implement a net that can differentiate between 10 types of objects. To do so, we will use the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset consists of 60.000 colored pictures, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, split across 10 different classes that you can check in the following image. The dataset is divided into 50.000 training pictures and 10.000 for testing.", "To develop this implementation, we will not use TensorFlow, but Keras instead. Keras is a framework that works over TF and brings flexibility, quickness and easiness of use. Those are the main reasons for its latest increase in popularity across Deep Learning developers.", "What is going on? Only an accuracy of 10%? It seems like our network is predicting the same class for all the samples. Meaning that something is failing. This surely has to do with our data. We have not pre-processed it before feeding it to the model.", "The first thing is to pre-process the data to make the task as easy as possible for our network. If we fail to do it, as we have data that goes from 0 to 255, the network will never learn anything.", "To carry out this pre-processing, two things are usually done:", "1) Divide each dimension by its standard deviation, after the data has been centered (subtracted the mean)", "2) Normalize so that the minimum and maximum of each dimension are -1 and 1. This only makes sense if we start from data with different scales but that we know should be similar, that is, that they have a similar importance for the algorithm. In the case of images, we know that the values that can be taken are from 0 to 255, so it is not strictly necessary to normalize since the values are already on a similar scale.", "Normalization must be done only with the training set. In other words, we should calculate the average and standard deviation of the training set and use those values with the validation and test sets.", "Now, we prepare the validation and test data using the mean and standard deviation of the training set.", "Wait, but we don\u2019t have validation data! Well, we will implement this example in this way, but it\u2019s very important that when we do real developments we have all 3 sets:", "All right, so let\u2019s get our test set ready:", "Now we are ready to test again our net with normalized data:", "This a notoriously better result than the previous one. So we can proudly say that we have our first CNN trained with an accuracy of ~0.99 in training and ~0.7 in testing.", "The next logical question should be:", "How can there be such a difference between training and testing?", "As you all may be thinking already, in deep learning there is also over-fitting, in fact, even more, pronounced than in other techniques.", "For those of you who don\u2019t remember what overfitting is, think about this:", "You have a network that can detect which character is appearing at any given time in FRIENDS chapter 4x08. It works perfectly, and it can tell which characters are on stage with 99.3% accuracy. It works so well that you try it out with the 5x01. And the result is that it\u2019s only 71.2% accurate.", "Well, this phenomenon is known as overfitting, and consists of creating an algorithm that works very well in our data set, but is extremely bad at generalizing.", "You cand find a deeper exploration of overfitting and the techniques to minimize it in this article.", "Look at the graph that represents the precision based on the times:", "And take a look at this example:", "The layer with 20 layers works better than the one with 3, right? However, what we usually look for is that it has a good generalization capability (it works well when new data is found). Which one do you think will work better if you see new data?", "Surprisingly enough, the one on the left.", "Let\u2019s go back to our example. In our case, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all like it much better if instead of ~99 vs. ~70, we got ~90 vs. ~85, right?", "How can we achieve this? With standardization and regularization techniques.", "Important Note: in practice, the only pre-processing that is usually done with images is to divide all their values by 255. This is usually enough for the network to work properly, and so we do not depend on any parameters related to our training set.", "There are several ways to reduce the over-fitting as much as possible and thus have an algorithm capable of generalizing more.", "The technique known as Batch Normalization is a technique developed by Ioffe and Szegedy that aims to reduce the change of internal covariates, or Internal Covariate Shift, which makes the network more robust to bad initializations.", "Internal Covariate Shift is defined as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the different distribution of input data between mini-batches. The lesser this difference between mini-batches, the more similar the data that reaches the network filters, the more similar the activation maps will be, and the better the network training will work.", "This is achieved by forcing the network activations to have a chosen value of a unitary Gaussian distribution at the beginning of the training. This process is possible because normalization is a distinguishable operation.", "It is normally inserted just before the activation function is executed:", "In mathematical terms, what we do is center and normalize each mini-batch that comes into our network with a mean and standard deviation calculated with the mini-batch, and then rescale and offset the data again with parameters learned by the network through training.", "Furthermore, as we are calculating the average and standard deviation for each mini-batch, instead of for the whole dataset, the batch norm also introduces some noise that acts as a regulator and helps to reduce overfitting.", "This technique has proven to be very efficient for training networks faster.", "We can see that the accuracy has improved by 2%, which once we are getting to high numbers is a huge step. But there is still room for improvement.", "Regularization consists of penalizing in some way the predictions made by our network during training so that it does not think that the training set is the absolute truth and thus knows how to better generalize when it sees other datasets.", "Take a look at this graph:", "In this graph, we can see an example of overfitting, another of underfitting and another that can generalize correctly.", "Now, look at this example following the one before the 3 networks with a different number of neurons. What we see now is the network of 20 neurons with different levels of regularization.", "You can play with these parameters here:", "and here\u2019s a much more complete one:", "In the end, it is much better to have a net with many layers and apply regularization, than to have a small one to avoid overfitting. This is because small networks are simpler functions that have less local minimums, so the gradient descent reaches one or another depending a lot on the initialization, so the losses achieved usually have a great variance depending on the initialization.", "However, networks with many layers are much more complicated functions with many more local minima that, although they are more difficult to reach, usually have all similar and better losses.", "There are many methods of regularization. Here are the most common ones:", "The L2 regularization is possibly the most common.", "It consists of penalizing the loss function by adding the term 1/2 * \u03bb* W**2 for each weight, which results in:", "The 1/2 is simply for convenience when calculating the derivatives, as this leaves \u03bb* W instead of 2*\u03bb* W.", "What this means is that we penalize very high or disparate weights, and prefer them to be all of a similar magnitude. If you remember, what the weights imply is the importance of each neuron in the final calculation of the prediction. Therefore, by doing this, we get all the neurons to matter more or less equally, that is, the network will use all its neurons to make the prediction.", "On the contrary, if there were very high weights for certain neurons, the calculation of the prediction would take them much more into account, so we would end up with a network with dead neurons that are useless.", "Moreover, introducing the term 1/2 * \u03bb* W**2 in our loss function make our weights to approximate to zero during the gradient descent. With a linear decay of W+=-\u03bb\u22c5W.", "Let\u2019s see if we can improve our network by applying the L2 regularization:", "L1 is also quite common. This time, we added the term \u03bb|w| to our loss function.", "We can also combine the L1 regularization with the L2 in what is known as Elastic net regularization:", "The L1 regularization manages to convert the W weight matrix into a sparse weight matrix (very close to zero, except for a few elements).", "This means that, unlike L2, it gives much more importance to some neurons than others, making the network more robust to possible noise.", "Generally, L2 usually gives better results. You can use L1 if you have images in which you know that there are a certain number of characteristics that will give you a good classification and you do not want the network to be distorted by noise.", "Another type of regularization is the one based on restrictions. For example, we could set a maximum threshold that the weights cannot exceed.", "In practice, this is implemented by using the descent gradient to calculate the new value of the weights as we would normally do, but then the norm 2 of each weight vector is calculated for each neuron and put as a condition that it cannot exceed C, that is:", "Normally, C is equal to 3 or 4.", "What we achieve with this normalization is that the network does not \u201cexplode\u201d, that is, that the weights do not grow excessively.", "Let\u2019s see how this regularization goes:", "Dropout regularization is a technique developed by Srivastava et al. in their article \u201cDropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting\u201d that complements the other types of standardization (L1, L2, maxnorm).", "It is an extremely effective and simple technique, which consists of keeping a neuron active or setting it to 0 during training with a probability p.", "What we achieve with this is to change the architecture of the network at training time, which means that there will not be a single neuron responsible for being activated to a certain pattern, but we will have multiple redundant neurons capable of reacting to that pattern.", "Let\u2019s see how applying dropout affects our results:", "And now, let\u2019s see the effects of Max norm + Dropout:", "There are more techniques to deal with overfitting such as Max pooling, changing the strides\u2026etc. In practice, the best is to apply several of them and test which combination provides the best result according to the problem faced.", "As always, I hope you enjoyed the post, and that you gained an intuition about how to implement and develop a convolutional neural network!", "If you liked this post then you can take a look at my other posts on Data Science and Machine Learning here.", "If you want to learn more about Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence follow me on Medium, and stay tuned for my next posts!", "Industrial Engineer and passionate about 4.0 Industry.
