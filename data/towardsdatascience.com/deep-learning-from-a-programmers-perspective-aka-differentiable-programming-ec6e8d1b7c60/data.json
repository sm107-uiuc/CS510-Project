One of the main reasons is that the basic problems faced by DL are general enough to be of interest to an insane amount of disciplines, from computer vision to neural machine translation to voice interfaces. More importantly, DL concepts can also be derived and studied from a broad range of point-of-views, which is why you can find machine learning books and articles arising from the fields of statistics, information theory, signal processing, mathematics, and many others.", "Neural networks themselves, the key tool in DL, were born after WWII from a unique mix involving neurophysiology, cybernetics, behaviourist psychology, electrical and later computing engineering, and then survived in one form or the other with multiple rebrandings, most notably in the form of \u201cconnectionism\u201d first and \u201cdeep learning\u201d today.", "Practitioners in the last years have witnessed a further rebranding, that started with the spread of highly-flexible programming libraries such as PyTorch, Chainer, and others. Despite their differences, all these libraries share two fundamental characteristics: (i) back-propagation is fully automatic and transparent with respect to the user (via the use of automatic differentiation); and (ii) code for the networks and the models\u2019 logic integrate seamlessly with other programming constructs, such as conditional branchings and loops.", "As a result, despite their biological namesake, neural networks today are more suited to a programmer\u2019s mindset, and its knowledge of modularity and encapsulation, than to, e.g., biologists and their knowledge of synaptic adaptation and chemical neurotransmitters.", "This shift in perspective goes under many names, most notably \u201cdifferentiable programming\u201d (an older idea popularized by Yann LeCun one year ago) and \u201csoftware 2.0\u201d. A differentiable program (DP) is a piece of code implemented using \u201cdifferentiable\u201d operators (aka neural networks), whose internal logic is adapted by one or more optimization routines in a data-driven fashion. The conceptual difference with \u201cstandard\u201d neural networks lies in the diversity of differentiable operators that can be used (e.g, differentiable read/write operations, neural arithmetic units, etc.), and in the fact that these operators are blended with a wide variety of standard constructs and \u201csoftware 1.0\u201d pieces.", "Differentiable Programming is little more than a rebranding of [modern] Deep Learning techniques [\u2026] But the important point is that people are now building a new kind of software by assembling networks of parameterized functional blocks and by training them from examples using some form of gradient-based optimization. (source: Yann LeCun on Facebook).", "As a corollary, all software design problems, from debugging to security, privacy, and fuzzing, can find extensions and their place in the new extended \u201cdifferentiable software\u201d stack.", "More than a rebranding, DP can be seen as a change of mindset: deep networks are not anymore biologically-inspired tools that somehow \u201clearn\u201d as our brain do \u2014 they are programming constructs. In this line of reasoning, in this article I want to show how many machine learning / deep learning concepts can arise naturally when starting from pure programming, i.e., thinking of unit testing, encapsulation, modularity, and the like. This is not another \u201cdeep learning explained to programmers\u201d article \u2014 or at least I hope so! This is more a sketch of a \u201cdeep learning explained FROM programmers\u201d article: the natural step in moving towards differentiable programming.", "Note: this piece is a work-in-progress. Any comment or feedback is highly appreciated.", "DPs, just like their standard counterparts, are composed by functions. Functions are (preferably small) pieces of code that takes some input parameters x, and return some output value y:", "Any program can be expressed as a sequence of elementary operations, interleaved with basic control flow and loops. As any experienced programmer knows, writing a function is much simpler that ensuring that the function is correct. This is why in modern programming practice, any function should come with one or more unit tests, that evaluate its correct behavior on a series of use cases:", "In machine learning terminology, this set of use cases is called the test set. An intriguing property of unit tests is that they are generally simpler both to design and to implement than the function they are testing (which is why an entire programming phylosophy is built on top of them).", "Consider for example a bank\u2019s programmer writing a function to determine whether a given client x should be given a loan (y=1) or not (y=0). The full body of this function will be (probably) a messy thing, full of insider knowledge from his/her part, nested if-else branches, judgmental evaluations, and the like. Testing the function, however, is trivial: one can simply select a series of known clients for which the desired output is known, and evaluate the function on them.", "In a standard unit test, scoring badly a single client from our test set will fail the entire routine. However, nothing prevents us from writing soft test assertions that evaluate without necessarily failing. For example, we might consider our test successful in this scenario if more than 75% of the clients in the test set are correctly classified from our routine.", "Having soft test measures as described above brings above the idea of optimizing our program: a function scoring 80% is probably better than a function scoring 77%, while still leaving open room for improvement. Sadly, we lack a structured way of deciding how to modify the function in general.", "Note: we could decide to randomly mutate every single instruction inside our function (e.g., change an \u201cif a > 0\u201d clause to an \u201cif a \u2264 0\u201d clause) and test the new set of functions, a.k.a. genetic programming. However, we have no guarantee that even one of these possibly thousands of mutated functions will somehow be better than our original one!", "The insight beyond DPs is that if we suitably restrict the type of elementary operations that we use in our program, then it is possible to design a much better routine for optimizing it from our data. As the name suggests, a DP requires all elementary functions to be differentiable, i.e.:", "Let\u2019s see an example of a differentiable function, with a single input parameter, b:", "The blue line is continuous: there are no discontinuities between any value of its input parameters and the ones immediately close. The function also allows for derivation (the green line), and we can inspect the derivative to see whether the function will increase or decrease when we increase or decrease the input b. Examples of differentiable functions are the sum, the product, the square root\u2026", "Limiting ourselves to differentiable functions looks like an immense challenge, since any \u201ccrisp\u201d decision, resulting in a clear discontinuity in our graph, will be forever beyond the grasp of our algorithm. Even taking a simple 0/1 binary decision, or deciding to read a single entry from a database, are instructions that cannot be encoded in such a way. In the AI field, this is known as the symbolic vs. subsymbolic challenge: an approach based on continuous functions cannot manipulate in a straightforward way discrete symbols, such as words or mental categories.", "Apart from the differentiability of f(x), we also need to ensure that the testing procedure is differentiable. If both constraints are satisfied, we gain an immensely powerful tool in exchange for our lack of expressiveness, in the form of numerical optimization. Using information on the derivatives, we can design automatic iterative algorithms that are able to automatically learn the \u201cshape\u201d of our functions by maximizing the test metric. You can think of this as an extension of a compiler, that in addition to producing executable code, \u201ccalibrates\u201d the internal parameters of the function that determine how the constituent elementary functions vary.", "Our discussion up to this point has a big \u201celephant in the room\u201d that we have not mentioned: numerically optimizing the same performance measure we wish to test is a rather bad idea. In order to see this, consider that by looking at a unit test, we can always implement a simple lookup table mimicking its test cases, that will always achieve 100% accuracy in the test. Another way of saying this is that \u201clearning is not memorization\u201d: a bank is only interested in historical information on its clients if it can learn something about future clients, that it has not seen up to now.", "In machine learning, a function that adapts too much to its test data is said to overfit. The solution to this problem is straightforward: we simply need to ensure that the data that we use for optimization is different from the data we use for testing. Going back to our programming example, any programmer writing both the function and the unit tests is prone to \u201cinformation leakage\u201d and possibly cheating, but if we use two different programmers (a.k.a., black-box testing), then we are fully confident our test routines tell us something meaningful.", "Training/test separation also has another advantage: while the training criterion has to be differentiable, the test criterion does not have such requirement. Consider again the problem of classifying users: even a very simple objective such as \u201cf(x1) == y1\u201d (something called the 0/1 loss in ML terminology) cannot be differentiated, let alone directly optimized. However, we can optimize an appropriate surrogate term instead (such as the cross-entropy), and still be able to test our application in terms of accuracy.", "In \u201csoftware 1.0\u201d, the programmer chooses a sequence of operations for the function, and then selects a series of use cases for the unit test. In a DP, test cases are more properly collected than chosen, as they represent historical information from which we want to extract some insights. Because DPs need data also in their optimization phase, and because this data generally needs to be at least one order of magnitude greater than the test cases, differentiable programming is a data-hungry discipline: finding data, labeling it, ensuring that it properly describes our problem domain, eliminating biases are all prerequisites for tackling a software problem in the \u201c2.0\u201d version.", "Next, a programmer needs to choose a correct metric to optimize (the loss), and the specific shape for f(x). Just as all the programs currently in execution all around the world are derived from a relatively small number of primitives, a small number of differentiable operators allows us to define an exponential number of possible \u201cprogram structures\u201d for f(x), and the ability to do this intuitively is what distinguishes a deep learning engineer with years of experience from a beginner.", "Many marketing campaigns advocate for deep learning as a tool for automatically solving tasks by throwing more and more data at the problem. Clearly, this could be not be further from the truth. The mental role of the programmer is shifting from defining a very precise sequence of symbolic operations, to specifying a template of differentiable operations whose details should be learned from the data. This is not a trivial task, because we are not structured for reasoning in subsymbolic terms, and we find it extremely hard to mentally visualize a sequence of subsymbolic operations. As a result, building a DP becomes a fascinating mix of intuition, experience, bag-of-tricks, and clever debugging.", "More in general, it is also difficult to fully isolate the \u201ccompiler\u201d (the optimization routine) from the rest of the program, and as a consequence one has to tinker with optimization parameters and flags, or even modify the models themselves to make them easier to optimize.", "The prototypical differentiable operation is a linear combination. For example, a linear combination of two inputs a and b is:", "Both a and b concur in deciding the value of c, each with a certain weight that can be found by the algorithm. Linear combinations are the building blocks of all DPs, because they represent the simplest possible ways of inserting parametric relations between objects in our program. c can be an intermediate step in our computation, or even the final output value.", "Mathematically, linear combinations cannot be stacked: a linear combination of linear combinations is the same as a single linear combination with different parameters (you probably need to read this twice). If we want to have sequences of linear operations, we need to interleave each of them with one or more nonlinearities. In the terminology of deep networks, these are called activation functions. Linear combinations and activation functions are the basics of classical neural networks, loosely representing \u201csynapses\u201d (the connecting lines in the diagram above), and thresholds.", "DPs, however, are not limited to operations that have a biological resemblance. The \u201cDP toolkit\u201d today is very broad, and we can just mention a few representative examples.", "Consider a generic conditional instruction of the form \u201cif condition a is satisfied, then do f(x), otherwise do g(x)\u201d. As long as condition a is not a part of the differentiable component of our program, then we have no problem. However, things are harder when we also want to learn (optimize) the clause, because as stated above we cannot differentiate with respect to a binary decision.", "The differentiable version of branching has two components. The first one is to preprocess the condition a with a so-called sigmoidal function:", "As you can see from the graph, irrespective of the value of a, the value of \u03c3(a) (the output of the sigmoid) will be a number between 0 and 1, probably closer to one of the two extremes. Instead of simply selecting one of the two branches, then, a \u201cdifferentiable if\u201d takes a combination of both branches weighted by the condition itself:", "In this way, the condition a can be the output of another DP learned together with the rest. Because of the form of the previous expression, this idea also goes under the name of gating in the deep learning literature. A similar mechanism, attention, allows to implement differentiable routines for giving more or less weight to different components of a program.", "Reading and writing from memory is another key component of most programs. Once again, however, if these operations need to be part of a DP, they need to be \u201csmoothed\u201d to make them differentiable (since selecting a single address in memory is a non-differentiable operation). Fascinatingly, one can design differentiable read/write operations using the same logic as before: we let the program read/write all locations, via a suitable linear combination of the elements.", "Classical arithmetic is also beyond the scope of DPs, because we have no trivial way of forcing the weights of our program to be exact integers. Nonetheless, we can try to bias our architecture to make arithmetic-like computations. This is the case of the recent neural arithmetic logic unit, which uses a clever combination of nonlinearities and attention mechanisms to force weights to be close to either -1, 0, or +1.", "Now consider a generic loop mechanism, where we iterate over the elements of an array a and collect the results through the application of a function f:", "This kind of operation does not require any modification in the differentiable world! In fact, if f is a DP, we obtain a known object called a recurrent neural network, a network with a small memory (in the form of the intermediate values z) that can learn to process sequences of elements:", "Recurrent networks can also be combined with gates to improve their capabilities, or with small attention mechanisms to automatically learn when to stop iterating.", "Clearly, there are many more differentiable operators! If you are working with special types of data (e.g., images, graphs) you can define specific operations for them, such as convolutional or diffusion operators. Similarly, if you need a more structured output (e.g., sequences), you can combine other operators to bias your DP towards these special cases.", "If one really wants to advance deep learning towards differentiable programming, it is not enough to have math tutorials for programmers: we need to rephrase/rethink the entire field in programming terms. This post is my \u201cmental sketch\u201d of how such rephrasing could go.", "It is common to describe deep learning in terms of \u201clearning from data\u201d. However, adapting a program to the data at hand is not necessarily a foreign concept for a programmer: a software that fine-tunes its internal logic by reading summaries from a database could be said of performing a very rough version of this. For an experienced programmer, it is much harder conceptually to think of a blend of \u201ccrisp\u201d and differentiable programs, and how one can develop an intuition towards how to solve a problem with a set of primitive differentiable operators. This one, I believe, will be the main \u201cmental bareer\u201d to the full adoption of a software 2.0 stack.", "Assistant Professor @ Sapienza | GDE for ML | Chairman @ Italian Association for ML
