With the broadening and fast-paced developments in the space of technology, it is clear that utilizing AI in the financial industry is key to economic development. Now, more than ever, it is evident that these theoretical revolutions in computer science bring novel applications of AI across global markets.", "In countries like the Philippines, where the service sector has been one of the \u201cstrongest and fast-growing sectors\u201d\u00b9 of the economy, innovations in AI have the potential to increase national participation in global value chains. Moreover, AI developments and multinational companies that engage with national talent could involve the country more deeply in the international services trade and accelerate the spread of AI-specific tacit knowledge.", "Jean Alfonso-Decena is making huge strides across the conversational AI space amidst this era of disruption. With her outlook of \u201cexploration and experimentation\u201d\u00b2, Jean is creating value both within the Philippine technology landscape, and across AI in the global fin-tech space. As the Head of Operations & Partnerships at Starbutter AI, she sits at the intersection of business, data science, product, and engineering. Awarded by Google as one of the Best 3 AI Agents on the Google Assistant Platform, Starbutter AI was founded to help consumers select financial products\u00b3. Jean oversees the company\u2019s business operations and manages partner relationships, and helps design and build artificially-intelligent virtual assistants to \u201chelp consumers pick financial products and discover [these products] through conversational advertising and performance marketing\u201d\u2074.", "Amber: Could you tell us a bit about your background?Jean: I worked in the Startup \u2014 Customer Service space for over a decade starting with 7 years of IBM tenure when they invested in a BPO arm in Manila, Philippines. I was part of the pioneering team that helped train and ramp up the organization finding and building talents that supported a major US Telco. After an astonishing leadership growth journey with IBM I moved on to the Silicon Valley scene, shifting into copywriting work for a major e-Commerce company based in Redwood City. After just a few weeks I was pulled out of the Content Team to form the pioneer Customer Service team which I led and helped grow for the next 4 years. Took a break from the corporate scene to become an entrepreneur, only to find my way back into leading and growing another CS team for a media giant based in Boston.", "The customer service scene has been a huge blessing to me in that the space allowed me to grow in all levels, not just professionally. Took another break to get yoga/meditation teaching certification in Sri Lanka and Rishikesh in India. Then Starbutter AI came along. It\u2019s been one long auspicious journey to finally be in this special place called Starbutter AI.", "A: Did you always know that working in the fin-tech space was what you wanted to do? What inspired you to pursue a career in the startup world and work with Starbutter AI? And what perspective did your experience in information and communication studies contribute to that decision?", "J: Working in fin-tech was never in my plans or wildest dreams, let alone in AI. I had a totally different trajectory \u2014 I was gearing up to spread love and light through conscious entrepreneurship while using all the years of leadership, e-Commerce and people/project management training I\u2019ve received. While in the middle of my spiritual travels, I got connected with Starbutter AI. The company name intrigued me so I looked it up, and between yoga and meditation, I was researching the team, AI and fintech more and more. The company mission, values and the founders piqued my brain and captured my heart. The possibility of jumping into a deeply mysterious (AI) realm, learning about fintech and working with some of the brightest minds in the space were my main reasons for shifting gears.", "My self-talk at that time, in a nutshell: when you receive the opportunity of a lifetime to help build bots that augment the lives of humans, grab it. The founders\u2019 unique mission is what signed me up.", "A: In your DEVCON Lightning Talk, \u201cJobs of the Future\u201d, you described the innovation and interdisciplinary cooperation needed to create products in the AI virtual assistant space. You also described how AI and machine learning applications are highly influenced by the environment they are built in, and the people they are built by. Why do you think it is important for technologists to take this collaborative approach when building chatbots and other products that are used by a diverse subset of customers?J: I always use the \u201chuman baby\u201d metaphor when I speak about building chatbots. Although they\u2019re not entirely the same, they have commonalities. Raising a baby takes a village \u2014 I know as I\u2019m a mom. But even before the baby is born, plenty of preparation is to be done to ensure the child grows beautifully in the womb, and comes out healthy. This journey is best taken with the mother\u2019s support network to optimise growth and delivery of the baby which includes family, health specialists, parent communities and other experts in the field.", "\u201cWhen you receive the opportunity of a lifetime to help build bots that augment the lives of humans, grab it.\u201d", "The whole process of building chatbots, from end-to-end, involves careful curation of designing and building it. Several factors come into play including user experience, machine learning and a host of other considerations. It literally takes several brains and hands to build a single bot that delights its users. Skipping one is like leaving a critical element out of the picture. The bot will come out incomplete and user experience will feel off. You never want that, especially in the conversational AI space. Moreso if you have diverse customer demographics, which we have. You want to make sure that all bases are covered before you bring your bot out to the world and keep improving from launch.", "I think this applies to any product or line of work \u2014 but rings truer in the world of virtual assistant design.", "A: Starbutter AI aims to help customers get \u201cmatched with financial products as easily as possible\u201d. How does Starbutter AI achieve this mission, and what role do Starbutter AI\u2019s conversation agents play in this? Could you describe your experience working on this goal during your time as a senior AI trainer focusing on natural language processing, machine learning, and UI/UX?J: The world of financial products is still a conundrum as far as finding helpful information. It takes weeks up to months of researching online, comparing literature, visiting banks, doing phone calls or emails, and consulting your financial-savvy friends and relatives to help you decide which insurance to take or which bank to pick in opening a savings account. It involves a lot of resources and giving your trust and finally making this huge life decision. Starbutter AI makes it easy by deploying our virtual assistant that serves a short three-to-four-question form, and customizes the top three company recommendations based on their answers. Our virtual agents do the heavy-lifting for the users \u2014 what usually takes months entails less than 30 seconds for the bot to process. The users still own the decision \u2014 our agents\u2019 job is to propose their best matches after answering the form.", "\u201cThe radical shift in technologies is taking tasks away from humans, so we need to know what we\u2019ll make out of our university degree and work experience. We need to know what will remain relevant and which skills and knowledge we can capitalize on as we move forward.\u201d\u2075", "I had a blast helping build these bots as a Senior AI Trainer \u2014 tons of research, analytics and design done to get a single bot launched and running. I\u2019m still involved in the process, but as a trainer I was right in the frontlines of training and improving them. Much like training and coaching a human agent.", "A: What was the biggest challenge you faced as the head of operations and partnerships at Starbutter AI, and how did you overcome it?J: Stopping myself from bringing out into the world as many virtual assistants and providing solutions to as many clients as I want!", "Seriously, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities in this space, given that Conversational AI is still nascent. It\u2019s a lot of fun to build these, and knowing that your solution truly brings value to individuals and organizations makes the whole process truly rewarding. I have to remind myself to take things slowly.", "A: Aside from your work in the AI virtual assistant space, you are also very active in the Philippine startup community. Are there any new innovations in the Philippine startup world that you\u2019re particularly excited about?", "J: Perfect timing! One of the groups that I had the honor to mentor at a Startup Weekend Manila in 2019 just launched the community they built as an initial offering to the vegan community in the Philippines called Swage. It is a marketplace for vegans and future-vegans in Manila, that connects underrepresented merchants and customers. What makes them unique is that they are a no-frills, straightforward community that aims to connect the two ends of the vegan marketplace spectrum. This is just the beginning, Swage has more technology in store in the coming months. My favorite part of this startup is that it was built by high school women founders who are not even vegan. Goes to show the brilliant minds of the Filipino youth and the power of the vegan message to get something built from the ground up.", "Other startups I\u2019m excited about are a couple of technologies currently being developed to address mental health and agriculture/farmer livelihood issues. I\u2019m not in liberty to talk in-depth about these yet, but these are definitely worth watching out for.", "\u201cWe need to surround ourselves with the kind of people that think and live creatively, totally out of the box. We need, all the more, to strengthen our human connection because through this, we can build relationships that can propel us in the right direction.\u201d\u2076", "A: What do you think is the biggest challenge for the next generation of aspiring technologists, and what can data scientists who are currently in the industry do to help?J: Technologists old and new, are not exactly apprised of the newest innovations and evolutions of the very same technology that they work with unless they seek it out (or have proactive mentors). There\u2019s a lot of passive waiting and watching for what\u2019s happening now, or coming out next. We all need to own our learning and evolution in the tech scene \u2014 we have to always be hungry and stay hungry for knowledge and opportunities in the world. Not just in technology. Most of these are not proactively offered \u2014 in fact, we have to find and get them.", "Having come from a no-technology background, I passionately advocate [the above], and supplementing this with authentic networking efforts. Connecting with others in and out of the tech scene brings forth new ideas and opportunities. You\u2019ll never know what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s up and about and what\u2019s next if you stay in your corner. There\u2019s a lot of value in bringing yourself out there and having conversations.", "Read voraciously, learn non-stop, network authentically.", "A: How can our readers get involved with Starbutter AI?J: Our website https://www.starbutter.com/ is a great place to start!", "In addition to making waves in the AI space with her role as a leading AI trainer, Jean has been an active mentor and thought leader in the Philippine startup industry. Her broad and deep experience at the heart of technology and product continues to inspire women technologists to innovate in data science. Today, Jean is leading a movement to democratize artificial intelligence and financial accessibility. As well as being a role model for Filipinas, Jean empowers women from diverse backgrounds to use technology for positive social change.", "Special thanks to Jean Alfonso-Decena for allowing me to interview her for this series, and a huge shout out to the TDS Editorial Team for supporting this project.", "Do you know an inspiring woman in tech who you would like featured in this series?
