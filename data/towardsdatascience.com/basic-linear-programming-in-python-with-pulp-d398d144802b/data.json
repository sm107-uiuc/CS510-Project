The value of one of the equations has to be maximized or minimized while the other equations are constraints. In high school, we used to plot the equations on a graph, shade the feasible region and find the value of the equation to be maximized or minimized by substituting the variables with the verticle values of the shaded region. I briefly go over this technique in the first part of the tutorial", "I will be dividing the tutorial into two parts", "Linear Programming is used to solve Optimization problems given a few constraints. An example problem is below:", "We need to maximize our Profits \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5", "The first point gives us our decision variables. The following point gives us our Objective Function which we need to maximize and the rest of the points give us our constraints.", "One way to solve it is to plot the equations on a graph, find the feasible area and then plug in the value of the vertices.", "Below is the feasible region shaded in green. The vertices are not necessarily integers and since we can not make cars in fractions, we can only accept integer solutions.", "Finding the integer solutions is not so trivial, we can not round up the vertice values and consider it a solution since we may violate some constraints in doing so. Using PuLP, we will be able to easily find the integral solutions", "PuLP is an open-source Python library used for Linear Programming. Documentation for the library can be found here.", "The first parameter is the name of our problem and the second parameter is the type of the Problem. We need to maximize our profits, therefore we use LpMaximize", "The first parameter is the name of the variable, the second parameter specifies the lower bound and third parameter specifies the type of the variable. The type can also be LpContinuous or LpBinary.", "We add the objective function and constraints to the instance of the LpProblem we created earlier.", "Upon printing the problem variable to the terminal we get the following output", "We can also use the status attribute to check the current Status of our problem. It is an integer value and we will need to use LpStatus to map it to a meaningful message", "We will use the solve method to solve the problem.", "If you print the status now, you should get the following output", "In just a few lines of code, we were able to maximize the profits by making more or Car B as compared to Car A.
