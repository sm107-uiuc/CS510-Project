Who do I talk the most with ? Do I send or receive more messages ? When do I text the most ?", "TL;DR : If you want to answer these questions about your Facebook Messenger History, check-out FBMessage Explorer", "Ever since I got a phone as a kid and started texting a lot, I have been curious about the statistics of this activity, and for a long time, I wasn\u2019t able to answer these questions. However, my texting habits progressively shifted from SMS to Facebook Messenger, to the point that I now use almost exclusively Facebook Messenger for texting. And one great thing about that, is that it makes it possible to download your whole texting history, and to do any kind of analyses you want on the data.", "So when I had to chose any subject for a Dataviz project during the last year of my engineering school, I jumped on the occasion: with my partner we built a tool that makes it possible to know everything I ever wanted about my texting habits, and much more. We called it FBMessage Explorer, and the good news is, this tool is available for anyone to use. We tried to make it as accessible as possible: no need to write a single line of code, just point and click !", "The first part of this article roughly explains the different features, and how to read the result, and then I drill down on my own messages to outline some of the insights I could extract for myself. However the idea is not to expose my texting life to the world, but more to do a demo of this tool and what you can get from it, so that in turn you use it with your own data. Last part is a detailed explanation of how to download and use your data, so please go ahead and try it for yourself !", "When you first open the website, first thing you see is this weird looking screen with dots everywhere, curves on the bottom and left pane, and bar charts on the right.", "What does this correspond to ? Let\u2019s take each part one by one.", "To allow the user to drill down on very specific aspects of their history, we made it possible to filter the data based on multiple criterion. If you click on any bar of the bar charts on the right, only the messages corresponding to this criteria will be left, and you will see everything change: dots will disappear, and bar charts and curves will update to reflect the selection. This way you can for instance analyse only the messages that you sent, go back on one single thread between you and your crush, or exclude every group thread to focus on one-on-one conversations.", "But that\u2019s not it, you can also filter on the date and time of day: just grab the handle of the grey window, and drag it so that it fits the period you want to study. You will see all the central pain zoom in on the desired zone, and the different bar charts update to correspond to the selection. Same is true for the time of day !", "But the real true power lies in the possibility to do cross filtering ! This allows you to analyse the patterns of the messages only you sent in one particular thread, during the evenings of the month of may 2017 \u2014 or truly any combination of filters !", "Finally, if you click on the color-wheels next to the different bar charts, each dot takes a different color matching the bar to which it corresponds. This way, you can identify patterns that you would not have noticed otherwise.", "After this long rant about how the tool works, let\u2019s get to the cool stuff: what insights did I extract from this tool ? Which will lead us to what insights can you extract from this tool ?", "I will just expose a few of the insights that I learned from my own data. I tried to keep this article as private as possible, and I feel I couldn\u2019t really highlight how deep you can go and the interesting bits you can find.", "\u201cThe idea is not to expose my texting life to the world, but to do a demo of this tool, so that in turn you use it with your own data\u201d", "As I said, I tried to make it as easy as possible to use the tool with your own data. All you have to do is download your Facebook data through their specific tool, unzip the file, and select the correct folder from your browser window. Let\u2019s take these steps one by one.", "Facebook will create a zip file on their servers, and send you an email when it is ready. It is usually pretty quick, but sometimes it can take up to a few days. When you receive the email, log in on Facebook, download the file, and unzip it. If you go through the files, you should see different folders: one for each of the categories you ticked when creating your file. The one that we will use is the \u201cMessages\u201d folder.", "Open FBMessage Explorer in Chrome or Firefox, click on \u201cExplore your own data\u201d, then \u201cUse your own file\u201d, and select the folder \u201cMessages\u201d that you just downloaded. Wait for the tool to process your data (it can take up to a minute depending on how many messages there are to process), and start exploring !", "\u201cIs he crazy ? I won\u2019t ever give my Facebook history to this website !\u201d", "You are probably wary of handing all of your private messages to a tool that you don\u2019t have any reason to trust. And you should ! Some browsers, such as Chrome, even issue a scary warning saying you are going to upload all of your messages and you should think twice before doing it. But this warning is not really legitimate, and here are a few points to show you that it is safe:", "\u201cThe browser loads the data into memory, and does all the processing locally: not a single piece of data leaves your computer\u201d", "First, you are not uploading your data, you are just showing your browser where the data is on your computer, and granting it the right to do anything with it (which is why you get the warning). However FBMessage Explorer will not use this authorisation: the browser loads the data into memory, and does all the processing locally. Not a single piece of data leaves your computer.", "\u201cWhy should I trust what is written is this article ? It could be a lie and I wouldn\u2019t know !\u201d", "This project is open source, and the entirety of the source code is available for anyone to see. If you are familiar with programming, feel free to go and check it out. If you are not, the fact that this is open source just means that the nerds can go through the code and see everything that happens under the hood. If I\u2019m lying and some data is sent to someone, they will know and they will report me in some way or another (probably in the comments section).", "Finally, if you are still not sure that your data is safe, you can shut down internet before using FBMessage Explorer.", "\u201cIs he stupid ? It is an internet based tool, it won\u2019t work\u2026\u201d", "Yes it will. If you first go on the website and wait for it to load, your computer now has everything necessary in memory. You can then shut down internet, and select the file on your computer as explained above. Since all the processing and computations are done locally, everything will work just fine, and you can be absolutely certain that your data is safe and did not leave your computer.", "And please let me know if you have any issues when using the tool, any feedback, question, suggestion, etc\u2026", "Your home for data science.
