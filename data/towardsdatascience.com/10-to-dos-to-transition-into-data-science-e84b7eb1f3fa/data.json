Fundamentally, a data science role derives value from the ability to create actionable insights. The responsibilities of a data scientist differ from those of a research scientist in academia. Industry tasks move at a faster pace and are less rooted in ambiguity than traditional research. This article will provide guidance to those looking to make the jump from academia to a role as a data scientist.", "What makes an adept data scientist is the ability to adapt to new technologies and information. Continued learning of new techniques and technologies will provide an upper hand in acquiring a role and advancing within it. In my own experiences, I have come across a number of open positions requesting Go. While my work is predominantly written in Python, I have begun to create a small Go portfolio. There also exists bootcamps, open courseware, and remote programs for those looking for more structured learning of data science. For those with a graduate degree, I recommend something like Insight, which provides mentorship in addition to training. The biggest takeaway from this article is to keep learning.", "For those coming from an academic background, you may be familiar with the statistical programming language, R. According to an ad hoc search on the StackOverflow job board, R is a tag on only 1.26% of available positions. My guess is that number will continue to decline. R is not typically used in industry for two reasons. Number 1: R is open source and some companies require statistical software to have commercial liability, meaning SAS or Matlab are used. Number 2: R is slower at scale and the functionality of R is replicated in other languages such as pandas in python. If you are planning to switch to industry, start now by avoiding R.", "The best way to really learn something is to teach. A blog doubles as a portfolio and place to reinforce things you have learned. Medium is a great place to start writing and engaging others. I like to post my side projects to Towards Data Science and I find it simple to contribute to their publication. Medium is a great platform to practice your data story telling with code, images, and even animations.", "Familiarity with Git and GitHub is a must for data scientists. Git is an example of version control. Version control creates historical copies of programs allowing teams the flexibility to make changes, fix bugs, or revert code to allow for smooth functionality. GitHub is also used as a public portfolio for data scientists. Another sweet benefit of GitHub is the ability to host domains for free through GitHub Pages.", "A website is a fun and handy project for boosting your presence and as a resource to allow others to view your accomplishments, blogs, or what ever else you care to share. My personal website can be found at codyglickman.com. Website development can be useful if you intend to freelance and some great examples of consulting data science websites include Claudia Ten Hoope and Data Dolittle.", "StackOverflow is a great place to learn and apply your knowledge to help others. StackOverflow is also the place, I go when I am completely stumped with something. The community is amazing and so helpful. You can also give back by helping to answer other peoples questions.", "The rise of remote work and the increasing scale of data means your personal laptop may not be able to handle the tasks required in industry. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are dominant players in cloud computing and all three have a low cost or free start up trials to familiarize yourself with issuing commands across the web.", "Twitter and LinkedIn are great places to connect with other data scientists. Networking with other data scientists creates new opportunities for growth. I found the inspiration for many side projects through tweets such as my photo mosaic project.", "To be a good data story teller, your code should lead others through your thought process and be easy to use. In my PhD program, I came across some software that was the standard in the field, not because it performs the best, but because it is incredibly easy to use. Packaging, dockerizing, or distributing your code is a must for proper collaboration with teammates or clients.", "Update your CV to include any of your accomplishments and newly acquired skills. Highlight projects you have created for your blog, share the link to your website, or include your GitHub to direct potential employers to your accomplishments.", "Keep learning| Ditch R | Start a blog | Get a GitHub account | Make a personal website | Create a StackOverflow profile | Familiarize yourself with cloud based computing | Connect with other data scientists on social media | Practice packaging your code and making it reproducible | Update your CV with data science material", "Good luck with the transition. Add additional tips and pointers to the comments and I will update this article accordingly. My name is Cody Glickman and I can be found on LinkedIn.
