You probably know the process as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).", "However, going through data projects, I found I always had the same questions I wanted answered immediately:", "If there is a target variable:", "If there are multiple data sets, or even comparing sub-populations within the same data set:", "The process to answer these questions seemed needlessly time-consuming and repetitive, so I thought: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if the process was automated and you could answer all these questions using only 1\u20132 lines of code?\u201d", "This is the reason I created Sweetviz. It is a Python open source library that can be installed using pip and is currently hosted on GitHub. There are other quality EDA packages out there, such as pandas-profiling and AutoViz, and you should also check them out since individual needs and preferences vary. The important thing is to find the tool that helps you most. However, personally, I found they didn\u2019t provide all the information I wanted, especially regarding isolating a target variable and comparing data sets/subpopulations.", "So I developed Sweetviz to provide as much of this information, immediately, and with only 2 lines of code.", "If you find that Sweetviz could be useful to you and you are not already familiar with it, I wrote another Medium article that goes in-depth on its core features, usage and presents an example case study.", "The main goal of this article, in addition to introducing the library, is to demonstrate the best use of the new features in 1.1. This new version of the library is not a major update but does contain new features that will benefit all users and whose usage is worth describing.", "In data visualization, sometimes a small difference can make a big impact. One of the more impactful additions in 1.1 is that the missing percentage of each feature is now highlighted and color-coded when there is missing data.", "This was suggested by a user on GitHub and really makes a difference. With this feature, you can now at-a-glance quickly pick up which features have missing data, and how much. To me it\u2019s not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the report, but I guess it\u2019s kind of the point, to draw attention to imperfections in the data.", "Although web browsers generally provide fallback rendering for characters not present in a font, the matplotlib graphics-rendering part of Sweetviz does not, so users ran into issues when rendering features containing CJK (and other non-latin) characters.", "Graphs were still rendered, however warnings were displayed during report generation, and \u201cunknown character\u201d symbols were displayed on on graphs.", "Version 1.1 comes embedded with a CJK font. However, because it is not as compact for Latin characters (which is the main use case right now), it is not enabled by default. If you are working with data that uses CJK characters, simply use a custom INI to enable its use (or if you are more familiar with Python package install structure and need this across all your projects, edit the sweetviz_defaults.ini in the installed package).", "First, create an override INI file containing a [General] section and the use_cjk_font = 1 key, as follows:", "Then, BEFORE doing any other Sweetviz calls, load the override file:", "By default, after generating a report, Sweetviz attempts to open the HTML file it just generated automatically. This was not desired behavior in many cases, so an \u201copen_browser\u201d option was added to the show_html() function. You can use it as follows:", "Correlations and associations are some of the most valuable information that gets automatically generated by Sweetviz. Version 1.1 enhances the display of these values by clearly highlighting the target variable (when present) and using bold for values above a certain threshold.", "As with CJK support, this threshold can be set using an INI override:", "These new features in Sweetviz 1.1 improve insights and usability, and are part of the ongoing development on this open-source project.", "Sweetviz summarizes data in a clean, compact form that answers most of the initial questions I have when looking at a new dataset. It provides instant insights and saves me a ton of time, and I hope you find it as useful as I do.", "Your home for data science.
