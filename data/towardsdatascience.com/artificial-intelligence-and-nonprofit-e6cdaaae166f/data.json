What is one of the greatest inequalities?", "It has been important for nonprofits to connect to makers of new technology to see if any part of the revenue can be funnelled towards a humanitarian purpose\u00a0or\u00a0programs. As much as we can question these technologies, because they are of course not faultless, it is arguably important that nonprofits are able to raise funds\u00a0and\u00a0address\u00a0issues. The question for these organisations is often a large looming \u2018how\u2019? In an ideal world their operations would not be needed, yet in the current situation there is a place for the charity sector, and how they operate is certainly changing.", "With these services moving to apps or social media with a variety of actors it does seem a challenge to keep up. In many instances the technologies such as AI or ML are integrated into existing products or services. Is it necessary to collaborate? We proceed with the assumption that it can be generated in conjunction with machine learning projects and that part of the money should go to charity. Let us explore a few options, but first a quick look at AI for Good.", "Since I have been writing about AI intensively I have seen the rising trend of AI for Good. It does seem like parts of the charity sector has caught an interest in this, however let us first look at the possibilities and a few possible issues. I will start with a review of the recent report by Salesforce called AI for Good Nonprofit Trends & Use Cases.", "The report from Salesforce cover five areas: (1) a description of AI; (2) why nonprofits should be involved; (3) imagining a better future; (4) using AI to advance your mission; (5) how to keep AI ethical.", "First I find their description of AI slightly confusing as it lumps everything into one basket. In this regard I believe the distinction made by Finland\u2019s famous course on artificial intelligence Elements of AI to provide a much more apt distinction from another previous article:", "\u201cNarrow AI or applied AI is the use of software to study or accomplish specific problem solving or reasoning tasks. Perhaps it can be said that Applied AI in this sense is the most common usage and easier to define than its counterpart broad/strong AI which has been said to at time border towards thoughts of AGI \u2014 more capable of experiencing consciousness.\u201d", "This being clearer and our specific focus being narrow AI we can move into the description by the report, and they present a few one-liner examples: Siri, the voice assistant; Facebook recommendation engine for photos; Amazon, recommending products; and Google Maps providing optimal routes to a desired location. After this they attempt selling the Salesforce product and outline how nonprofits can start using AI (learning more about applied AI):", "This sounds like an easy three step process, yet opens up for a large degree of complexity. It is increasingly important to process information in a good manner, and as such good quality data is additionally where nonprofits can make a difference. They provide a compelling argument from an article in Economic Times with for-profit organisations.", "\u201cAI and machine learning are making their mark as hot topics in the for-profit sector right now. In fact, for-profit organisations with AI expect to see a 39% increase on average in their revenues by 2020, alongside a 37% reduction in costs.\u201d \u2014 Economic Times (India Times) the 17th of January 2017 [bold added]", "In addition to this the use of artificial intelligence by nonprofits is projected to grow 361% in the next two years. This may be more telling as to the low amount of nonprofits that currently use artificial intelligence and how expensive labour AI or machine learning labour is. It is argued that on a global level, the values and principles that nonprofits embody can help shape the future of AI. Instead of exploiting vulnerable people these applications could be identified and get support.", "In the report it is additionally referred to five principles of AI for Good.", "We stand in front of a digital divide and we must do our best to act responsibly faced with grave inequalities.", "The report by Salesforce outlines benefits for individual nonprofits AI as opposed to commercial business. I have taken their two suggestions (as I felt the third was more like a sales pitch) and added some of my own thoughts to the mix:", "An interesting initiative which is mentioned in this regard is GovLab that is a think tank that often works with government related subjects such as activism and health care. The success of technology does completely depend on the relationship between actors developing this technology, and there has been several less successful governance projects (even by Microsoft). I revieved a report on AI governance in Argentina and Uruguay in this regard written by the the World Wide Web Foundation (by the guy who made the Internet). It is highly possible that uncritical applications within the field of AI can be damaging both to current trust and to future implementation of new projects.", "There can be many possible approaches to addressing this. One classical is focusing on donors. With data on your donors giving history with predictive insights you could run the analysis with a click of a button. There can be a prediction of likelihood to give, volunteering history. Program outcomes can be analysed and displayed with historical data, yet this should of course not always be a part of judging rather to better understand.", "However this does of course pose several question in regards to the ethics (moral principles). There is a growing trend of addressing this issue with Facebook beginning to make sizeable investments in this area both in training and research. Google is attempting to develop privacy technologies such as federated learning assisted by advancements in semi-structured machine learning. Thus attempting to learn what people do without having any way to in-depth understand who they are, which does seem a challenging task. The Salesforce report outlines six different ways to \u2018keep AI ethical\u2019.", "In a recent report by KPMG in March 2019 called Easing the pressure points: The state of intelligent automation we can get an overview of certain relevant technologies related to AI. It is described that: \u201cIntelligent automation is the catch-all phrase for disruptive technologies. It includes robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), cognitive computing (CC), and smart analytics.\u201d This is explained in a relatively accessible overview which I will relay.", "In this report KPMG Describes artificial intelligence as: the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour.", "Machine learning (ML): Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.", "Cognitive computing (CC): Cognitive computing is the simulation of human thought processes in a computerized model. Cognitive computing involves self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing to mimic the way the human brain works.", "Robotic process automation (RPA): Robotic process automation enables organizations to configure computer software or a \u2018bot\u2019 to capture and interpret existing applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems.", "These technologies within automation is highly relevant when we talk of artificial intelligence. It is often a combination of these technologies as an example used in self-driving cars. It is more about the operating model of a nonprofit rather than simple a one-shot revenue solution that will solve everything. There is an overview site called Artificial Intelligence: Enhancing, Accelerating, and Automating Decisions that has collected different reports on this topic.", "If we look outside the salesforce report according to the KPMG Venture Pulse report on the second quarter of 2019 artificial intelligence and machine learning (particularly in the field of cybersecurity) has in the past decade or so have advances in computing begun to yield significant advantages to harnessing the power of intelligent algorithms in automating key processes. Other projections by Credit Suisse predict rising revenues worldwide within artificial intelligence. Part of this could be directed towards the nonprofit sector.", "Before we dive into three short case studies we can ask how nonprofits are operating currently. With a short search for nonprofits cases and AI you may experience at the current time of the 7th of August 2017 that you will discover few cases readily available to understand. Rather there is much thinking and little doing; a careful approach that may be necessary. Are nonprofits not using applied AI because they are either unsure of it or unaware of it? This is a question which is not immediately easy to answer. Even nonprofits aimed towards AI seem hesitant to use or display their usage of such technologies.", "Google.org issued an open call to organisations around the world to submit their ideas for how they could use AI to help address societal challenges. They received applications from 119 countries, spanning 6 continents with projects ranging from environmental to humanitarian. From these applications, they selected 20 organisations to support.

This must be taken with a grain of salt, but in certain cases there are existing applications that can be used within a nonprofit sector too.

Gravyty was recently named the #1 \u201cnew fundraising idea that worked\u201d in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. In an article [curiously again written by a Salesforce member] he gives a set of pointers, he argues for:", "It requires a collaboration between nonprofits, private and government actors to work. Due to considerations of fairness, security, accountability and transparency.", "With the increasing focus on artificial intelligence together with its projected revenue growth it would make sense for nonprofits to work more distinctly towards understanding how it could keep coupling with frontrunners in technology to raise funds in the time ahead. The trends do point towards a convoluted space with disproportional data or even worsening inequalities exacerbated by this push towards large quantities with complete disregard for data quality or security.", "In this chaotic space with irresponsible and responsible actors nonprofits can take the role of bridging responsible and ethical use of technology while channeling resources to addressing the harshest inequalities we see on this planet.", "This is day 89 of #500daysofAI.
