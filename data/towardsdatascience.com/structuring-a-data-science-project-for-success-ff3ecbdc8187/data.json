The goal is to take large amounts of raw data and produce valuable actionable insights. The problem is that data science projects are inherently exploratory \u2014 you don\u2019t know what methods will work or what insights you will find. All this uncertainty is a ripe breeding ground for a couple of common project diseases:", "By structuring your project, you can develop ways to manage the uncertainty, avoid some of these project diseases, and get projects done on time.", "During my internship at Microsoft, I worked on the Education Customer Insight Research team. The purpose of the group is to use data to help define Microsoft\u2019s strategy in the Education space. My project for the summer was to analyze how educational institutions use Microsoft applications and services. This was a broad project idea, and purposefully so \u2014 my manager wanted to see what I would do with it. What follows is a collection of advice I received and lessons I learned.", "Why is it easier to learn a new language in school than at home? The truth is that many people work well with deadlines, well-defined goals, and imagined consequences for not meeting them. I am one of them and you might be one, too.", "I printed out calendars for the 3 months of my internship and taped them together vertically. I marked days that I would be traveling, going to conferences, or otherwise not working on the project in blue, and deadlines in red. Having a visual representation of time (colloquially referred to as a \u201ccalendar\u201d) near your desk makes it easy to check in with your progress. Posting it near my desk also added a little implicit social pressure. I doubt anyone spent time looking at my calendar, but clearly defining and publicly posting my deadlines made me more inclined to meet them.", "Personal deadlines are flimsy; they need all the external pressure they can get.", "Here are some deadlines you may want to include:", "Nothing is worse than someone butting into a conversation midway with irrelevant but strongly held opinions. Data science is like that. If you are new to an organization or a project area, you probably don\u2019t know enough to produce good insights. Sorry.", "However, there are probably many people in your organization who have been working in that area for a while and have intuitions about how the business works. You should talk to these people as soon as possible. If you are working on examining customer behavior, talk to sales or design. If you are planning on providing strategy recommendations, talk to PMs.", "Learn about what they do. Describe your project and get them to reflect on your goals. It may take time, but you will probably tease out valuable direction by the end. For me, I found it helpful to talk to PMs, user researchers, and engineers. I talked to them multiple times, but the earlier conversations, when I was formulating a proposal and scoping the project, were most important.", "If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re going to come up with a grand idea where your project will use a state-of-the-art algorithm and will solve the problem now and forever in the future. This grand idea will probably realistically require 6 months and 4 engineers to implement.", "You will likely not be implementing this grand idea.", "Your first goal should be to complete the minimal viable analysis. Think about what the stakeholders value and align your project so you are producing just that and little more, using simple methods. Set aside some of the dropped goals as reach goals. When you give your final presentation and someone asks \u201cDid you consider X in the case of Y?\u201d, you can cooly reply, \u201cYes, and I might have applied method Z, but that was out of the scope of the project.\u201d", "A simpler finished project is better than a fancy incomplete project.", "Something is going to go terribly wrong when you start working with the data, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Actually there is, you should start massaging the data as soon as you can. Don\u2019t neglect the planning phase, but don\u2019t forget that some data stream is going to drive you mad. It\u2019s best to discover it quickly. Navigating the many layers of customer licenses was a big pain during my project that occupied 2 weeks. There was no way I could have predicted it and it blocked me from some of my reach goals, but this was not a big deal.", "If you\u2019re trying some fancy new method three days before your final presentation, you\u2019re probably doing it wrong. Remember, you need to deliver insights, not methods. PMs will value a fancy algorithm less than they will value the thought you put into translating the insights into English. A fellow intern coined this \u201csocializing data\u201d. I think the industry jargon is \u201cstorytelling\u201d.", "Yes, your analysis is groundbreaking and all the world is foolish for not taking the time to understand it. But that\u2019s just the way it is. You have to do 80% of the hard work of translating your results into common language and developing memorable visualizations or dashboards. Plan on taking at least a full week to do this.", "During a meeting with an engineer, I asked the engineer a question about the business and he pulled up a dashboard made by a data scientist on my team ages ago. My manager pointed out that that should be the dream of every data scientist. You want to develop insights that are easy to understand and that people outside of your team adopt and cite in their regular work. Think timeless research.", "Remember that boring presentation you went to a while back with a lot numbers? Likely it suffered from a lack of focus. Focus on the actionable insights most aligned with the goals of your proposal. Think back to high school English class where you learned about persuasive writing. One of the key elements is knowing your audience. Try to think about delivering only the content that will move the audience: the stakeholders. Since you talked to them early on, this should not be too hard.", "Importantly, your project should tell a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The \u201cend\u201d should include clear recommendations that you have for stakeholders. Even if I\u2019m a little unsure, I often prefer to put an idea down so I have something to debate, rather than miss an opportunity to develop a thread of ideas. But you should determine you draw this line.", "Use functions and classes to keep your code modular and clean. Write tests \u2014 they\u2019re not just for software engineers! Machine learning algorithms are notoriously hard to debug. During my internship, I initially generated an affinity matrix of customers based on their usage of applications and services. However, I only realized days later that I had filled this affinity matrix with distances, not similarity scores, and my results were lies. (I was able to fix it and all was well.) Prevent the spread of lies; write tests.", "Code is 50% computer instructions and 50% documentation of those computer instructions for other humans. Well-documented code combined with a well-written presentation or report should give your analysis the best chance at survival.", "I hope the lessons I learned can help you with your projects. Good luck!", "Special thanks to Sooraj Kuttykrishnan, Jodie Draper, and the rest of the team at Microsoft EDU for a great summer and timeless mentorship.", "If you have thoughts on this article or want to hear more about the work I\u2019ve done, follow me on Medium and connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
