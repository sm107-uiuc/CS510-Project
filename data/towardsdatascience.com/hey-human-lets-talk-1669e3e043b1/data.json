Most people hate advertising: the awful messages in podcasts trying to get you to buy something you\u2019re not interested in, the display ads on seemingly every Web site in existence, and the pop-up videos that explode on your screen and headphones, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It\u2019s a kind of commercially acceptable torture, really.", "There is no global opt-out. Participating in public digital spaces includes an implicit social contract to absorb this cacophony of noise. While your brain has become adept at shoving these intrusions into the background, they are still there \u2014 adding a patina of irritation over what you are otherwise trying to accomplish or enjoy.", "Yet, it is the advertising that brings you the very platforms you\u2019re using. The reality is that the creators need to be paid for the things that they make. The Internet, for many reasons, has cultivated a culture where people want things for free. And advertising has sidled in to serve as the payment surrogate. We may find it evil, but it\u2019s a necessary one. Without it, the Internet would be but a shell of what it is today, or perhaps would be employing alternate monetization strategies that are even more odious.", "Andy Mauro, co-founder and CEO of Automat, envisions a future where marketing and advertising provide value-added services for the consumer \u2014 as opposed to following the long tradition of disrupting and degrading our experiences. Mauro has been working in speech recognition for almost 20 years, and his company, Automat, creates conversational AI for brands.", "\u201cI sometimes say to people, \u2018I spent the first half of my career working on things that people hate \u2014 those over-the-phone speech [recognition] systems, and the second half of my career working on things that nobody used \u2014 which is the mobile voice assistants, like Siri,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cIn a very real way we\u2019re still seeking the elusive killer use case in conversational AI.\u201d", "Conversational AI is the all-encompassing moniker for speech recognition, smart speakers, and chatbots \u2014 the wide range of language-based conversational technology. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually quite useful to have a single term,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cBecause the underlying tech is almost identical from a natural language understanding perspective. The ability to understand spoken or typed free form text, and the technology that goes into building a dialogue, a back and forth conversation \u2014 it\u2019s almost exactly the same between speech and text based inputs.\u201d", "One of the technologies on which Mauro and the team at Automat are working are conversational display ads. \u201cI think a really good place to focus attention, if you\u2019re trying to build something meaningful, is something that everyone does and no one likes,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cI don\u2019t think many consumers would say that they like display ads. I would say most brands who spend lots of money on them would also probably say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure that I love them either.\u2019 There\u2019s issues around, did anybody see them? Is the thing that saw them a real person, or was it some sort of automated system that\u2019s juicing the numbers? And ultimately, did I get any value from this ad?\u201d", "A conversational display ad tries to provide something better for consumers. \u201cFor example, I\u2019m reading a car blog. I\u2019m a car enthusiast and I\u2019m thinking about buying a car, and I see an ad. Today that ad, at best, is going to give me some financing information and the picture of the car. And if I click on it, it\u2019s going to bring me to the manufacturer\u2019s Web site or a dealership. It\u2019s taking me away from the content I was reading,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cWith a conversational display ad, I can click into that ad, not leave the content page \u2026 and I can chat with a virtual sales advisor who could tell me some things about the car, answer my questions, maybe even schedule me a test drive. So, that\u2019s a better consumer experience. And really, really importantly, in this world of data privacy and security, and all the things that are happening with Google and Facebook \u2026 this is pretty transparent and very opt-in from a consumer perspective. You know that you\u2019re chatting with a brand, and when you are providing information about what you might be looking for. It\u2019s much more transparent than making a search, or liking something on Facebook, which you have no idea that you\u2019re opting into a commercial transaction or an advertising transaction.\u201d That sounds like a huge upgrade. Whereas, today, ads are things you subconsciously block out even before you realize they are there, the type of functionality Mauro describes is more assistive. It\u2019s an online experience in sync with users\u2019 needs and desires, while also offering corporate interests compensation and incentive.", "There\u2019s no question that e-commerce is ripe for innovation. \u201cFor those of us who\u2019ve been around for a while, being able to shop in your pajamas at 3:00 AM was an amazing experience. It compressed both time and space in a way that the best and most successful innovations often do,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cBut nobody\u2019s really thought about [that experience] a whole lot in the last 20 years. I mean, e-commerce is still mostly just grids of product images, whether you\u2019re buying batteries, or you\u2019re buying a $5,000 handbag, or you\u2019re buying a car.\u201d", "\u201cWe discovered that there\u2019s all kinds of categories of e-commerce where graceful service can be both a much better consumer experience, and drive much better business results by basically just chatting with your customers,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cWe\u2019re usually talking about a web or mobile experience that\u2019s \u2026 a text based chat. And we\u2019ve seen just really amazing results from an engagement perspective, from a customer satisfaction perspective.\u201d", "The Automat team is also working on connecting the consumer experience across channels via conversational AI. For many consumers, the cross-channel experience for a company \u2014 from the Web site to the app to the brick-and-mortar store \u2014 can seem disconnected and highly variant. \u201cWe think this idea of using conversational experiences tied to brand personalities could be a good way to deliver a connected experience,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cI can have a unified conversation with the same person \u2014 in this case a virtual avatar \u2014 and get what I need throughout the consumer journey.\u201d From the brand\u2019s perspective, having consistency across channels is important. Part of brand strategy is identifying that brand\u2019s personality. Voice enables that strategic vision to manifest in a virtual avatar. And, since chatbot and voice technology is so easily nestled into any digital interface, it can become seemingly ubiquitous. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty connected experience,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cEven if you chatted on the Web to learn about the product, and maybe you chatted on mobile to get the order status, and maybe you had a usage question and you actually talked to your smart speaker.\u201d", "Automat spoke to hundreds of individual consumers who enjoyed having a conversation on a brand or retailer Web site. \u201cPeople felt like they got information they couldn\u2019t otherwise find on the Web site,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cNow, in reality, the Web site almost always had that product information somewhere, but it was \u2026 in a place where they had to do a lot of reading to get at it. And so, they felt like they got information they couldn\u2019t otherwise get.\u201d", "What this all boils down to is task completion. Rather than navigating hopelessly around a site, rather than chatting with a human who is juggling you with many other customers, the chatbot \u2014 if done well \u2014 can just pluck the pertinent information from the database and quickly give it to you. As a consequence, you\u2019ll feel like it went more quickly and actually spend more time engaged with the company. \u201cA lot of people think that guided product recommendation like this is about product discovery, finding the right product. And what we learned is, while that\u2019s of course true, what it\u2019s really about is product confidence. So, people were finding products okay, but what they really needed was someone, or in this case, something, to reinforce and tell them why this was in fact the right product for them.", "Of course, while conversational AI can create some big wins, it is not foolproof. \u201cIn language, humans are far, far, far better than machines are,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cI think we\u2019re a ways off from a fundamental change.\u201d There\u2019s usually not a single intent, or one single underlying message, in human communication. Language is more complex than that, but right now, NLP technology has its limits. \u201cThe underlying technical infrastructure is forcing us down a path where every sentence needs to meet in one thing.\u201d says Mauro. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not really how language works.\u201d The next breakthrough in natural language processing may require continuous understanding \u2014 where a machine can interpret the meaning, not just of what a person is saying at the moment, but also how that meaning evolves as the person continues to speak. \u201cThere\u2019s real, legitimate, philosophical and technical debate about is language tantamount to the AGI or artificial general intelligence problem,\u201d says Mauro. \u201cIf you solve language, have you made computers as smart as humans? And are those two things very related?\u201d", "Mauro has some inspiring thoughts about how these technologies might change the landscape of future work. \u201cWhat automated capabilities might we get that we haven\u2019t anticipated, that don\u2019t automate an existing job, but in fact do something that hasn\u2019t been before? Where can I get help that I otherwise don\u2019t have in any way, shape or form? I think that\u2019s a much more creative, hopeful, exciting way to look at it. I would just really challenge everyone to get out of the idea of somebody has job X, let\u2019s make an AI do it. And let\u2019s think about providing new forms of employment that only AIs can [help enable],\u201d says Mauro. If conversational AI can help enable a better consumer experience, maybe new forms of marketing work are on their way, too.", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
