Now let us try and understand some of the advanced concepts involved in probability. Like always, let us try and understand these concepts using real-life examples.", "Once upon a time, there was a person named John in a town Bayesville. John got to know about the deadly conditional virus which affected almost 1% of the population of that village. A worried John goes to the hospital to get tested. Unfortunately, John tests positive for conditional virus. John doubts whether the test was wrong, but the hospital informed that the test was 95% accurate. What does this mean for John?", "Notice that, there can be two ways in which the test could be wrong.", "False Positive \u2014 A person could test positive for a disease, he/she doesn\u2019t have. False Negative \u2014 A person could test negative for a disease, he/she does have.", "The other two cases when the test is right are-", "True Positive \u2014 A person tests positive and does have the disease.True Negative \u2014 A person tests negative and does not have the disease.", "The test has an accuracy of 95% means\u2026.", "Given the above information, How sure are you that John has the disease?A) He almost certainly has the disease.B) He probably has the disease.C) It\u2019s 50\u201350.D) He probably does not have the disease.(Choose an answer and keep it in your mind for now.)", "Here we are given some information I (test is 95% accurate) and based on this information we are predicting the probability of an event E (John having the disease) which can be denoted by P (E|I).", "Now, let us imagine that this test is conducted for every person in that village. The results are as follows-", "Now let us look at the negative results. Only one person who was affected by the virus tested negative and this looks fine. Now have a look at the positive results. Here we see that a large number of people are false alarms. (False Positives = 99 implies 99 healthy individuals were tested positive which is quite bad).", "We can see from the above table that the total number of people who tested positive is 118. Among 118 people only 19 people are truly infected and the remaining 99 are healthy persons who are diagnosed wrongly as positive. Now the probability of being infected if you are tested positive is around 16%. (The proof for the answer will be shown later.)People who chose the option D give yourselves a thumbs up! The probability of really being infected if tested positive is very less for this test.", "Now, based upon the new information I (test statistics of the complete village), the probability P(E|I) of occurrence of event E (John having the disease) completely changed. (I guess most of you did not expect this!)", "In general, our beliefs about uncertain information can change when we are presented with new information.", "We make many judgments every day based on uncertainty. For example, we make decisions about the weather based on information such as the weather report, how it looks outside, and advice from friends. We make decisions about who we think will win a sports event based on what we read in the paper, our knowledge of the teams\u2019 strengths, and discussion with friends. Conditional probability is simply a way of quantifying our beliefs about uncertain events given information. For two events A and B", "Two events are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the other. Example- Getting a 6 on the first roll of a dice is independent of getting a 1 on the second roll of a dice. For independent events \u2014  P(A\u2229B) = P(A)\u22c5P(B)", "Two events are said to be dependent if the occurrence of one event does affect the other. Example- Removing marbles from a bag. Each time we remove a marble of a certain color, the probability of removing the same colored marble will change. For dependent events \u2014 P(A\u2229B)=P(A)\u22c5P(B|A)", "If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, then it\u2019s impossible that they both occur, which means (A \u2229 B) is an impossible event (and the probability of impossible events is always 0). Example-Getting a 5 (event A) and getting a 3 (event B) when we roll a regular six-sided die. It\u2019s impossible to get both a 5 and a 3. For Mutually Exclusive events \u2014 P(A\u2229B)=0", "Now, what if we just want to find P(T+), the probability that a person selected at random will get a positive result? There are two possible scenarios when someone gets a positive result:", "In the first scenario, note that two events happen: The person has the virus and is tested positive(Virus \u2229 T+).", "In the second scenario, two events happen: The person does not have the virus and is tested positive (No Virus \u2229 T+).", "Since there are only two possible scenarios, we can understand the event T+ as the union of the events (Virus \u2229 T+)and (No Virus \u2229 T+):", "The events (Virus \u2229 T+) and (No Virus and T+) are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen both at the same time), because a person tested positive cannot both have and not have the Virus. This means that we can calculate the probability of their union using : P(A\u222aB)=P(A)+P(B)( P(A \u2229 B) = 0 for exclusive events).", "Virus and T+ are dependent events because the test result depends on a person having a virus or not. Hence P( Virus \u2229 T+) = P(Virus) * P(T+|Virus)(For dependent events P(A\u2229B)=P(A)\u22c5P(B|A) )", "We see P(T+) \u2014 the probability of testing positive \u2014 is only 5.9%. This is mostly because the probability of having the virus is very low in the first place.", "In the above picture, prior probability means the probability of having disease before getting tested. We found out P(E) ie. P(T+) = 0.059 above. The hardest part of this formula is finding out the prior probability. In our case, as we discussed above that 1% of the population is affected by the condition virus we can consider prior probability to be 0.01.P(E|H) = P(T+ | H) = 19/20 = 0.95.", "Bayes originally considered a thought experiment where he was sitting in front of a table and asked his assistant to throw a ball on the table. Now, this ball could land anywhere on the table and he wanted to figure out where it was. So he asked his assistant to throw on another ball and tell whether the next ball was to the left, right, top or bottom of the first ball, and Bayes would note that down and ask for more and more balls to be thrown on the table. What Bayes realized was that through this method he was able to update his idea of where the first ball was. Of course, he could never be certain of the exact position of the ball, but with each new piece of evidence he could get more and more accurate and that\u2019s how we see the world. We don\u2019t exactly understand it perfectly, but as we gain evidence we improve our ability of understanding.", "Let us consider a man who stayed in a cave for half of his life and suddenly the next day saw the sunrise and felt \u2018Does this happen every day?\u2019 As time moved on, the man understood that this is how the world runs. So Bayes theorem wasn\u2019t a formula intended to be just used once, but it was intended to be used multiple times, each time gaining new evidence and updating the probability that something is true.", "Now let us get back to John. Let us assume John went to another hospital to get tested and the test result was positive the second time too. What happens to the probability now? We will apply the same formula but change one variable. Instead of prior probability, we will use the posterior probability and calculate the new probability.", "In this article, I tried to discuss the intuition behind the conditional probability and Bayes Theorem by explaining with an example. I hope you took home something new today!", "I\u2019ll be happy to hear suggestions in case you have any. In my next article, I will explain the widely used concept of Hypothesis Testing. Till then, Stay Home, Stay Safe, and keep exploring!", "If you would like to get in touch, connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
