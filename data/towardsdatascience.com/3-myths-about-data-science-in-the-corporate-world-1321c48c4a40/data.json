Data Science includes all methodologies and techniques used to process, analyse and extract useful knowledge from information, mainly by means of Statistics, Machine Learning and AI. While the emphasis now is on Machine Learning and AI, it is actually its basic usage as a statistical analysis tool what makes it interesting for the average user.", "Data analysis has been present since the beginning of computer age back in the 50s (first non-scientific applications of computers were related to census analysis and statistics) and it has been intensively applied during last 20 or 30 years. If Data Analysis is an old player in the business and corporate world, why is it so important now? The reason is that it is now when the combination of technology availability, costs and tools have converged into a point that can be truly adopted by everyone.", "Let\u2019s take a technology example. Digital cameras exist since Sony launched the Sony Mavica in 1981. But it was not until the late 90s when the cost, usability and reliability of the digital cameras made them available for the masses.", "This turning point has already taken place with Data Science, as it is now when this technology can be applied in a cost-effective way. The current state of the art in terms of cost and availability of tools simplify development and usage up to a point where its adoption is profitable and beneficial.", "These points might not be obvious at first glance though, and it is common to think that Data Science is reserved for complex and cutting edge environments. I can enumerate the three most common myths or misconceptions shared before you gain certain exposure to the field.", "We can find departments and teams processing and analysing data in extremely different contexts. It does not matter if it is sales, marketing, engineering, operations or logistics. Everyone needs to analyse their data, extract knowledge out of it and share and communicate these findings to improve business operations.", "Most of the times, data is analysed using simple Spreadsheets (which is absolutely not the right tool, especially if you handle large quantities of data). Teams and departments with skills and resources in computing could sometimes use more elaborated tools such as custom programming.", "In pure business departments that are not related to technology, several data mining and business intelligence tools have been consistently applied to data for corporate reporting. Data analysis is not new and it is constantly applied in the business and corporate world.", "Data Science changes this approach. Now there are technologies such as Jupyter Notebooks which enables anyone with limited computer skills to process large quantities of data efficiently. Data presentation and charts are also easier to generate, and the overall cost of a once reserved for very technical and well-funded departments has dropped to a point where it fits in every budget.", "\u00ab The focus is no longer in reporting but on getting useful knowledge from data and making teams delivering value instead of reports. \u00bb", "What Python and Jupyter Notebooks bring into the table is a tremendous simplification of data analysis. Jupyter Notebooks have reduced all the pain of custom analysis to levels where anyone with basic development skills can use a much better environment to analyse data. It is actually much more complex and expensive to use any other approach, including BI tools.", "\u00ab Jupyter Notebooks have largely reduced the complexities and costs associated with Data Analysis. In just a few years they have become a defacto standard and the lingua franca for Data Science. \u00bb", "If in your team or project you are intensively using spreadsheets to analyse data, chances are that there is room to incorporate Data Science. It is not just a matter of choosing a new tool, it actually helps you to deliver much more value than the one that can be delivered with standard spreadsheets and business intelligence tools.", "A barrier often found is that it might seem that Data Science is reserved for experts. Media is full of complex explanations and algorithms, but for the average business user, the possibility of incorporating plain statistics to large data sets and gain the flexibility to explore and manipulate data poses much more value than the more elaborated AI algorithms.", "Data Science can be intimidating for the newcomer, especially in the corporate world, but in reality, it is just a smarter way to process and analyse data that effectively overcomes all spreadsheet limitations in terms of flexibility and performance. Data visualization is greatly improved too, as the degree of flexibility of Jupyter Notebooks in terms of graphs is astounding thanks to the Matplotlib graphics library.", "It is true that your team will need to gain some new skills, but those are not actually too much harder than an advance usage of the macro and scripting languages used in Spreadsheets. And the payoff after the transition is huge.", "Reality is that you do not need infrastructure (and you should actually avoid it). While you can deploy locally Jupyter Notebooks on your staff computers or company servers this is not the best way to start a Data Science project. You are generating a weak environment which needs to be implemented, maintained and supported \u2014 all that meaning costs \u2014 . In-house deployments will also not contribute to focus on your core business.", "Local deployments will, as mentioned, pose hidden costs and worse than that, they will not facilitate teamwork, collaboration and data sharing of data. Make no mistakes, Data Analysis is there to iterate, work in a team and explore different ways to analyse and understand data. It is all about collaboration and iteration.", "\u00ab Collaboration and agility are the keys to success in Data Science projects. Infrastructure must be kept to the minimum. Cloud solutions fit perfectly. Projects must be small and with concrete goals that are shared across the team. \u00bb", "A central deployment is definitively possible (all technologies involved are open source) but it will pose even greater amount of hidden costs in terms of implementation and maintenance. Things such as security and backup needs to be considered too. I have done this in the past and while it is feasible it becomes actually in \u201canother service\u201d to maintain.", "A smarter way to implement projects in Data Science is to leverage on an existing cloud service such as SaturnCloud.io. What I like from this cloud service is that infrastructure can be deployed in one click, it promotes collaboration from minute zero and it allows to scale up and down our projects, something difficult to achieve with in-house solutions. A cloud service also eliminates the need to deal with software and library dependencies, updates, security and backup.", "Notebooks can be shared with a link, even with third parties, collaborators, customers or even the general public. If your project grows and you want to use your private cloud you can do that too.", "The cloud is again making things easier, cheaper and faster as you can avoid the zero-added value activity of in-house infrastructure and service deployment while providing a live, easy to maintain environment which also facilitates collaboration. I am a big fan of reducing the owned infrastructure as much as possible, as experience shows that it is easier and cheaper to use specialised infrastructure rather than owning it.", "It is much easier than you think to enable your project and team with Data Science capabilities. You need no infrastructure and you shall not be frightened by the complexity and theoretical nature of the many articles found on the Internet. Data Science is all about analysing data and outstanding results can be achieved by just using plain Statistics.", "Think about having the right skillsets in your team and ensure to promote collaboration. Jupyter Notebooks promote iterations where data is gradually analysed and where many different lines can be explored and shared. Using cloud service will reduce hidden costs, ensure usability and flexibility and most importantly will promote from day zero the collaborative environment needed for any data analysis activity.", "Your home for data science.
