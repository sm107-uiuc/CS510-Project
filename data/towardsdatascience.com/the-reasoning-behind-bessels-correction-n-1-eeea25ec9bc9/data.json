It\u2019s a measure of dispersion of data, and is the root of the summed differences between the mean and its data points, divided by the number of data points\u2026minus one to correct for bias.", "This is, I believe, the most oversimplified and maddening concept for any learner, and the intent of this post is to provide a clear and intuitive explanation for Bessel\u2019s Correction, or n-1.", "To start, recall the formula for a population mean:", "Well, they look identical, except for the lowercase N. In each case, you just add each x\u1d62, and divide by how many x\u2019s there are. If we are dealing with an entire population, we would use N, instead of n, to indicate the total number of points in the population.", "Now, what is standard deviation \u03c3 (called sigma)?", "If a population contains N points, then the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is the summed-and-averaged squared differences of each data point and the population mean, or \u03bc:", "But what about a sample standard deviation, s, with n data points and sample mean x-bar:", "Alas, the dreaded n-1 appears. Why? Shouldn\u2019t it be the same formula? It was virtually the same formula for population mean and sample mean!", "The short answer is: this is very complex, to such an extent that most instructors explain n-1 by saying the sample standard deviation will \u2018a biased estimator\u2019 if you don\u2019t do it.", "The Wikipedia explanation can be found here.", "To really understand n-1, just like any other brief attempt to explain Bessel\u2019s Correction, requires holding a lot in your head at once. I\u2019m not talking about a proof, either. I\u2019m talking about truly understanding the differences between a sample and a population.", "A sample is always a subset of a population it\u2019s intended to represent (a subset can be the same size as the original set, in the unusual case of sampling an entire population without replacement). This is a massive leap alone. Once a sample is taken, there are presumed, hypothetical parameters and distributions built into that sample-representation.", "The very word statistic refers to some piece of information about a sample (such as a mean, or median) which corresponds to some piece of analogous information about the population (again, such as mean, or median) called a parameter. The field of \u2018Statistics\u2019 is named as such, instead of \u2018Parametrics\u2019, to convey this attitude of inference from smaller to larger, and this leap, again, has many assumptions built into it. For example, if prior assumptions about a sample\u2019s population are actually quantified, this leads to Bayesian statistics. If not, this leads to frequentism, both outside the scope of this post, but nevertheless important angles to consider in the context of Bessel\u2019s correction. (in fact, in Bayesian inference Bessel\u2019s Correction is not used, since prior probabilities about population parameters are intended to handle bias in a different way, upfront. Variance and standard deviation are calculated with plain old n).", "But let\u2019s not lose focus. Now that we\u2019ve stated the important fundamental difference between a sample and a population, let\u2019s consider the implications of sampling. I will be using the Normal distribution for the following examples for the sake of simplicity, as well as this Jupyter notebook which contains one-million simulated, Normally distributed data points for visualizing intuitions about samples. I highly recommend playing with it yourself, or simply using from sklearn.datasets import make_gaussian_quantiles to get a hands-on feel for what\u2019s really going on with sampling.", "Here is an image of one million randomly-generated, Normally distributed points. We will call it our population:", "To further simplify things, we will only be considering mean, variance, standard deviation, etc., based on the x-values. (That is, I could have used a mere number line for these visualizations, but having the y-axis more effectively displays the distribution across the x axis).", "I took two random samples, the first only 10 points and the second 100 points:", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at these two samples, without and with Bessel\u2019s Correction, along with their standard deviations (biased and unbiased, respectively). The first sample is only 10 points, and the second sample is 100 points.", "Take a good long look at the above image. Bessel\u2019s Correction does seem to be helping. It makes sense: very often the sample standard deviation will be lower than the population standard deviation, especially if the sample is small, because unrepresentative points (\u2018biased\u2019 points, i.e. farther from the mean) will have more of an impact on the calculation of variance. Because the difference between each data point and the sample mean is being squared, the range of possible differences will be smaller than the real range if the population mean was used. Furthermore, taking a square root is a concave function, and therefore introduces \u2018downward bias\u2019 in estimations.", "Another way of thinking about it is this: the larger your sample, the more of an opportunity you have to run into more population-representative points, i.e. points that are close to the mean. Therefore, you have less of a chance of getting a sample mean which results in differences which are too small, leading to a too-small variance, and you\u2019re left with an undershot standard deviation.", "On average, samples of a Normally-distributed population will produce a variance which is biased downward by a factor of n-1 on average. (Incidentally, I believe the distribution of sample biases themselves are described by Student\u2019s t-distribution, determined by n). Therefore, by dividing the square-rooted variance by n-1, we make the denominator smaller, thereby making the result larger and leading to a so-called \u2018unbiased\u2019 estimate.", "The key point to emphasize here is that Bessel\u2019s Correction, or dividing by n-1, doesn\u2019t always actually help! Because the potential sample-variances are themselves t-distributed, you will unwittingly run into cases where n-1 will overshoot the real population standard deviation. It just so happens that n-1 is the best tool we have to correct for bias most of the time.", "To prove this, check out the same Jupyter notebook where I\u2019ve merely changed the random seed until I found some samples whose standard deviation was already close to the population standard deviation, and where n-1 added more bias:", "In this case, Bessel\u2019s Correction actually hurt us!", "Thus, Bessel\u2019s Correction is not always a correction. It\u2019s called such because most of the time, when sampling, we don\u2019t know the population parameters. We don\u2019t know the real mean or variance or standard deviation. Thus, we are relying on the fact that because we know the rate of bad luck (undershooting, or downward bias), we can counteract bad luck by the inverse of that rate: n-1.", "But what if you get lucky? Just like in the cells above, this can happen sometimes. Your sample can occasionally produce the correct standard deviation, or even overshoot it, in which case n-1 ironically adds bias.", "Nevertheless, it\u2019s the best tool we have for bias correction in a state of ignorance. The need for bias correction doesn\u2019t exist from a God\u2019s-eye point of view, where the parameters are known.", "At the end of the day, this fundamentally comes down to understanding the crucial difference between a sample and a population, as well as why Bayesian Inference is such a different approach to classical problems, where guesses about the parameters are made upfront via prior probabilities, thus removing the need for Bessel\u2019s Correction.", "I\u2019ll focus on Bayesian statistics in future posts.
