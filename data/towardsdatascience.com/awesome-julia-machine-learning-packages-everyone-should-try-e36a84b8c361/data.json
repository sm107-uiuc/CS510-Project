Nowhere do I believe this is more true than in\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Though Julia is still a relatively young and docile programming language, it can sometimes be quite amazing just how mature the ecosystem has become. Nowhere do I believe this is more true than in the scope of machine-learning. While other languages like Python certainly have more packages for machine-learning, Julia\u2019s machine-learning packages are definitely worth checking out. Not only do they have the added benefit of being written in a fast high-level language like Julia, but they are great pieces of software that are easy to use regardless of what language they are being used from.", "Many of these packages take advantage of Julia\u2019s expressive syntax. Furthermore, they all use functions that are available in the Julia base to accomplish similar tasks on different types using Julia\u2019s polymorphic dispatch. This makes package-hopping a lot easier than it would typically be in another language. Another cool thing about many Julia ML packages is that they don\u2019t tend to be very bulky, as often you don\u2019t need to write a surplus of Julia code in order to do statistics.", "Kicking off the list is a Julian machine-learning staple,", "Flux.jl is typically used as an abstraction layer to create neural networks in Julia. Flux.jl is one of my favorite packages to use in the Julia language, and was one of the first that I picked up whenever I started using Julia. One big advantage to Flux is that it is incredibly small. It provides light-weight abstractions atop of Julia\u2019s already fantastic AD and GPU computing code-base. Oh, and did I mention, Flux has fantastic CUDA support? Parallel computing is always a huge plus, but the addition of the fantastic work that has been put into JuliaGPU makes the combination of an Nvidea graphics card and Flux a machine-learning engineer\u2019s dream come true.", "Flux\u2019s weight also makes it great for use on servers, as it won\u2019t take up a lot of space, and can very easily be placed into tiny virtual environments with Pkg. To summarize, Flux is portable. Flux is also written in one-hundred-percent pure Julia code, which is an added benefit as you won\u2019t have to deal with alien syntax or need to use a package like CSyntax to get things done with Flux. If you\u2019d like to get a little more familiar with Flux.jl, I have you covered with a short introduction I wrote in this article:", "Merlin is another deep learning framework for creating neural networks in Julia. Merlin.jl is a package that many developers might overlook.However, this would be a mistake as Merlin is an incredible tool that has saved me a lot of time on many different occasions. Like Flux.jl, Merlin is relatively lightweight and written in one-hundred-percent pure Julia code. Merlin tends to outpace Flux in a lot of operations, though that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will always be faster.", "Also similar to Flux, Merlin has built-in GPU support with CUDA. Not only that, but Merlin models are typically more deployable than Flux models. While this isn\u2019t to say that deploying Flux is particularly difficult, it isn\u2019t particularly easy. So I would say that if you plan to deploy an API that uses a neural network with Genie and Julia, I would probably choose Merlin. On top of all these cool features, Merlin also includes a small distribution library.", "Knet is another deep-learning framework for Julia, with a little twist. Knet was actually created for use at Ko\u00e7 University. As a result, the package seems to be a lot better maintained than most of the other packages on this list that are typically managed by only a few people working on it out of passion. Also unlike Flux and Merlin, Knet is a bit of a heavier package. Knet also is not written in pure Julia, being written in various languages such as C and MATLAB running below the Julia code.", "It should be noted, however, that a very small portion of Knet is written in C and MATLAB, totaling only about 1.8 percent. I would say Knet is one of the best choices on this list for beginners because it is simply easy.", "I was hesitant to add Lathe to this list because I hold a bit of bias towards it, as", "However, I felt it wouldn\u2019t make sense not to add it here because of the large list of features that Lathe offers. Firstly, Lathe comes with a quite large statistics library that includes things like chi\u00b2 tests, Bayesian statistics, t-tests, f-tests, and even some lesser-known statistics like the signs test. On top of that, there is also validation included with the stats module, which has accuracy metrics for continuous and categorical predictions. As the cherry on top of the statistics in this module, Lathe.jl also includes a decent little library of distributions.", "To add to the DS/ML fun, Lathe also has tons of pre-processing tools that you might not have expected from this rather immature package. Good examples of this are feature-scalers, train test splitting, and categorical encoding. On top of that, Lathe has a short but sweet module for loading data into Julia. These tools are useful if you were to want to load any sort of images or similar data into Julia.", "Finally, Lathe has an ever-expanding library of machine-learning modules, and even support for building convolutional neural networks. Lathe also has a pipeline framework that makes it incredibly easy to deploy a Lathe model with JLD2 serialization. Lathe is also written in pure Julia, and is relatively solid on documentation (although there is a big documentation update coming in 0.1.2 where doc-strings are being revised.) I would say that if Flux is the Tenserflow of Julia, then Lathe is the Sklearn of Julia. This means that Lathe is inclusive, providing all the tools you need to get up and running, and it is also incredibly beginner-friendly and easy.", "If you\u2019d like to support me by checking out Lathe, you can do so here:", "MLBase.jl is another Julia module that follows a similar methodology to Sklearn in Python. MLBase.jl includes tools for generalized data processing, like feature scalers and encoders, as well as score-based classification and validation. This package also has a very unique and useful feature,", "MLBase\u2019s model tuning will make it incredibly easy to get your hyper-parameters optimized correctly. MLBase, as you might have already guessed, MLBase.jl is written entirely in Julia. It is also the lightest package on this list. It is also incredibly easy to use, so would be another great choice for beginners.", "There you have it; these are some of the best machine-learning modules that Julia developers have at their disposal. While some of them certainly serve different purposes than others, picking and choosing features from all of them tends to be the most optimal plan of action. As for the best package to start with, I would say it is between", "From there, I would ask \u201c What is it you want to do?\u201d as each of these modules have their own individual unique talents that might be useful or not useful depending on your situation. Overall, though the Julia ecosystem isn\u2019t quite as mature as something like Python\u2019s monstrous ecosystem, that is part of what makes Julia fun. Lots of people have made fantastic contributions to the language, and more importantly, data science as a whole. To conclude, while Julia might not have the crazy amount of awesome modules that you may see in other languages, the packages it does have are typically well-developed and only starting their journey.", "Your home for data science.
