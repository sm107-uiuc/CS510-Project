The only player to ever come close to Gretzky\u2019s goal record was Brett Hull in the 1990\u201391 season, when he put up 86 goals in just 78 games for the St. Louis Blues. Since then, no player has broken 80 goals, and only two players in the last 20 years have scored more than 60 in a season (Alexander Ovechkin \u201908 and Steven Stamkos \u201812). The 92-goal record is just one of the NHL records held by Wayne Gretzy that many believe will never be broken. In this article, I will approximate the odds of beating Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal record using a Monte Carlo analysis. I analyze the greatest goal scoring seasons in the modern era to test how lucky a player would have to be to break 92 goals.", "First, some background on Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal record and why it has never been broken. As stated above, in the 1981\u201382 season Gretzky set the NHL single season scoring record that has now lasted for 38 years. This is not purely due to the skill of \u2018The Great One\u2019 but also due to the different style of hockey played back then. See below for a graph of average goals scored per game in the NHL, data is from Hockey-Reference.com.", "The 1970s-1990s saw a large increase in goals scored per game. Rapid expansion of the NHL combined with higher skill players led to more goals scored in a single game. The late 80s and 90s brought with them better goaltending, better coaching, better players from around the globe, and a range of other factors that all decreased the number of goals scored per game\u00b9. An often asked question is, \u201cHow much of an effect did Gretzky have on the average goals scored per game during his career?\u201d. See below for a graph showing the average goals scored per game excluding goals and assists from Gretzky\u2019s career.", "Since the 1980s, the game of hockey has changed astronomically. The average number of goals scored per game has dropped from around 8 to 6, and the number of 50-goal seasons has also dropped. Between the 1979\u201380 season and the 1989\u20131990 season NHL players achieved a total of eighty-four 50-goal seasons\u00b2. Now, between the 2009\u201310 and 2019\u201320 seasons there were just 11\u00b3. As a result of increased player skill, better coaching, and technological advances in equipment, modern-era goal scoring is down both league-wide and for individual players. Could any player in the modern era break Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal season? Let\u2019s find out.", "Using player scoring statistics from some of the greatest modern-era NHL goal scoring seasons, I simulated the number of goals a player will score in a single NHL game. Then, I simulated 82 games to estimate an entire NHL season. I repeated this process thousands of times to estimate the true probability of a player breaking Gretzky\u2019s record. This method is known as a Monte Carlo analysis, and we can use it to simulate NHL seasons for a specific player and receive a distribution of possible outcomes.", "I used goal scoring data from NHL.com to make a probability distribution for the number of goals a player scores in a game. Then I randomly drew values corresponding to the probability distribution to determine the number of goals a player scores in a game. For example, in Ovechkin\u2019s 2007\u201308 season he scored a single goal in 34 games, two goals in 10 games, a hat trick in one game, and four goals in two games for a total of 65 goals. From this, we can estimate that Ovechkin 2008 had a (34/82)*100=42.5 percent chance that in any given game he scores one goal, a (10/82)*100=12.2 percent chance that Ovechkin scores two goals, a (1/82)*100=1.2 percent chance that he scores a hat trick, and a (2/82)*100=2.4 percent chance that he scores 4 goals\u2074. Below, I simulated Ovechkin\u2019s 2008 NHL season 10,000 times to see in how many of them Ovechkin breaks Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal record.", "Out of the 10,000 simulated 2008 seasons, Ovechkin broke Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal record 7 times, scored 105 goals in his best season, and the average goals scored across all 10,000 seasons was 65.0851 (compared to the actual 2008 season where he scored 65, this is what we\u2019d expect using a Monte Carlo analysis). Below is a graph comparing Ovechkin\u2019s best simulated season to Gretzky\u2019s 1992 season.", "So in 2008, Ovechkin had approximately a (7/10000)*100=0.07 percent chance of breaking Gretzky\u2019s single season goal record. But, again this estimate is lacking in that it is based on an already exceptional season. For a more accurate percent chance let\u2019s use the average of Ovechkin\u2019s 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons. I also used two other exceptional goal scoring showings from the modern era: Pavel Bure for the Florida Panthers between 2000 and 2001 and Steven Stamkos for the Tampa Bay Lightning between 2010 and 2012. Then as a more recent example of typical Rocket Richard winners in the past decade, Ovechkin 2018\u20132020. For each player, I simulated 100,000 seasons to get a more accurate distribution of results.", "Out of the 100,000 simulated seasons, Bure 1999 beat Gretzky\u2019s goal record 48 times, Ovechkin 2008 beat the record 74 times, Stamkos 2012 beat the record just two times, and Ovechkin 2019 beat the record zero times. In each of their respective best simulated seasons, Bure 1999 put up 101 goals, Ovechkin 2008 put up 103 goals, Stamkos 2012 put up 96 goals, and Ovechkin 2019 put up 84 goals. Below are those seasons plotted against Gretzky\u2019s 1982 season.", "So what would it take to break Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal record in the modern era? A player as good as Alexander Ovechkin between 2007 and 2009, has a 1 out of 1,351 chance of breaking Gretzky\u2019s single season goal record in any given season. This means that if they played 1,351 seasons straight, they would beat the record on average just once. No single player since 2009 has performed as well as Ovechkin did between 2007 and 2009. It would take an all new generational/gifted talent and/or a massive shift in the style of hockey to break Gretzky\u2019s 92-goal season within our lifetimes. Lastly, Gretzky scored 92 goals in just 80 games. Even if a player breaks Gretzky\u2019s single season record, they might not break Gretzky\u2019s 92 goals in 80 games record. \u2018The Great One\u2019 is immutable.", "[1]: This article from HockeyAnalytics.com summarizes well the changes in style through the years of the NHL.", "[4]: An obvious error in this simplistic analysis is that we give Ovechkin better odds to score four goals than three. Later on I will make a more accurate estimate of reality, but for now we will follow this example.", "Your home for data science.
