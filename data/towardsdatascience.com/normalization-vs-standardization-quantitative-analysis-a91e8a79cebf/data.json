Normalization typically means rescales the values into a range of [0,1]. Standardization typically means rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance).", "In this blog, I conducted a few experiments and hope to answer questions like:", "I\u2019ll analyze the empirical results of applying different scaling methods on features in multiple experiments settings.", "First, I was trying to understand what is the difference between Normalization and Standardization.So, I encountered this excellent blog by Sebastian Raschka that supplies a mathematical background that satisfied my curiosity. Please take 5 minutes to read this blog if you are not familiar with Normalization or Standardization concepts.There is also a great explanation of the need for scaling features when dealing with classifiers that trained using gradient descendent methods( like neural networks) by famous Hinton here.", "Ok, we grabbed some math, that\u2019s it? Not quite. When I checked the popular ML library Sklearn, I saw that there are lots of different scaling methods. There is a great visualization of the effect of different scalers on data with outliers. But they didn\u2019t show how it affects classification tasks with different classifiers.", "I saw a lot of ML pipelines tutorials that use StandardScaler (usually called Z-score Standardization) or MinMaxScaler (usually called min-max Normalization) to scale features. Why does no one use other scaling techniques for classification? Is it possible that StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler are the best scaling methods? I didn\u2019t see any explanation in the tutorials about why or when to use each one of them, so I thought I\u2019d investigate the performance of these techniques by running some experiments. This is what this notebook is all about", "Like many Data Science projects, lets read some data and experiment with several out-of-the-box classifiers.", "Sonar dataset. It contains 208 rows and 60 feature columns. It\u2019s a classification task to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.", "All the features in this dataset are between 0 to 1, but it\u2019s not ensured that 1 is the max value or 0 is the min value in each feature.", "I chose this dataset because, from one hand, it is small, so I can experiment pretty fast. On the other hand, it\u2019s a hard problem and none of the classifiers achieve anything close to 100% accuracy, so we can compare meaningful results.", "We will experiment with more datasets in the last section.", "As a preprocessing step, I already calculated all the results (it takes some time). So we only load the results file and work with it.", "The code that produces the results can be found in my GitHub:https://github.com/shaygeller/Normalization_vs_Standardization.git", "I pick some of the most popular classification models from Sklearn, denoted as:", "(MLP is Multi-Layer Perceptron, a neural network)", "The scalers I used are denoted as:", "*Do not confuse Normalizer, the last scaler in the list above with the min-max normalization technique I discussed before. The min-max normalization is the second in the list and named MinMaxScaler. The Normalizer class from Sklearn normalizes samples individually to unit norm. It is not column based but a row based normalization technique.", "Nice results. By looking at the CV_mean column, we can see that at the moment, MLP is leading. SVM has the worst performance.", "Standard deviation is pretty much the same, so we can judge mainly by the mean score. All the results below will be the mean score of 10-fold cross-validation random splits.", "Now, let\u2019s see how different scaling methods change the scores for each classifier", "The first row, the one without index name, is the algorithm without applying any scaling method.", "We know that some well-known ML methods like PCA can benefit from scaling (blog). Let\u2019s try adding PCA(n_components=4) to the pipeline and analyze the results.", "We can conclude that even though PCA is a known component that benefits from scaling, no single scaling method always improved our results, and some of them even cause harm(RF-PCA with StandardScaler).", "The dataset is also a great factor here. To better understand the consequences of scaling methods on PCA, we should experiment with more diverse datasets (class imbalanced, different scales of features and datasets with numerical and categorical features). I\u2019m doing this analysis in section 5.", "There are big differences in the accuracy score between different scaling methods for a given classifier. One can assume that when the hyperparameters are tuned, the difference between the scaling techniques will be minor and we can use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler as used in many classification pipelines tutorials in the web. Let\u2019s check that!", "First, NB is not here, that\u2019s because NB has no parameters to tune.", "We can see that almost all the algorithms benefit from hyperparameter tuning compare to results from o previous step. An interesting exception is MLP that got worse results. It\u2019s probably because neural networks can easily overfit the data (especially when the number of parameters is much bigger than the number of training samples), and we didn\u2019t perform a careful early stopping to avoid it, nor applied any regularizations.", "Yet, even when the hyperparameters are tuned, there are still big differences between the results using different scaling methods. If we would compare different scaling techniques to the broadly used StandardScaler technique, we can gain up to 7% improvement in accuracy (KNN column) when experiencing with other techniques.", "The main conclusion from this step is that even though the hyperparameters are tuned, changing the scaling method can dramatically affect the results. So, we should consider the scaling method as a crucial hyperparameter of our model.", "Part 5 contains a more in-depth analysis of more diverse datasets. If you don\u2019t want to deep dive into it, feel free to jump to the conclusion section.", "To get a better understanding and to derive more generalized conclusions, we should experiment with more datasets.", "We will apply Classifier+Scaling+PCA like section 3 on several datasets with different characteristics and analyze the results. All datasets were taken from Kaggel.", "Here is a sample of 5 rows, we can\u2019t show all the columns in one picture.", "We will suspect that scaling will improve classification results due to the different scales of the features (check min max values in the above table, it even get worse on some of the rest of the features).", "LinkClassification task: Predict has the client subscribed a term deposit?Metric: AUC ( The data is imbalanced)Dataset shape: (41188, 11)Counts for each class:no 36548yes 4640", "Here is a sample of 5 rows, we can\u2019t show all the columns in one picture.", "LinkClassification task: Predict if an object to be either a galaxy, star or quasar.Metric: Accuracy (multiclass)Dataset shape: (10000, 18)Counts for each class:GALAXY 4998STAR 4152QSO 850", "Here is a sample of 5 rows, we can\u2019t show all the columns in one picture.", "Here is a sample of 5 rows, we can\u2019t show all the columns in one picture.", "If you find some mistakes or have proposals to improve the coverage or the validity of the experiments, please notify me.", "Your home for data science.
