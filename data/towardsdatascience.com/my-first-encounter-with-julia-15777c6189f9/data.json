Although I have no prior experience in Julia, it was easy for me to pick up things quickly- as I have prior programming experience, and most importantly- Julia is designed to be easy to write.", "Julia works through REPL in the command line. I hear that Visual Studio Code\u2019s extension for Julia is also great. But it is best to use the Pluto for a task like image analysis and to be able to get instant feedback is something really helpful for it.", "Pluto interface is really good-looking, and I like the fonts chosen.", "And Pluto has a handy Live docs feature. You just need to place your cursor inside a function or an object, and if you click the Live docs icon, it will display the documentation for that particular function or object.", "Here I have placed my cursor in the rand method, and I am shown documentation like this-", "You have to type ??function() in Jupyter Notebook to get the documentation.", "Julia not only supports emojis as strings, but they are also supported for naming variables, too!", "See? You can name variables with emojis in Julia!", "Working with images in Julia is intuitive. You can load an image from the web or your local storage and work with that image in Julia.", "What\u2019s different in Julia, is that here, you work with the images themselves. In other languages, an image object or something similar is created, or we have to work with the path of the file. But here, one further level of abstraction is added, and you can just work with images themselves. Let me show you:", "First, you load from local storage or download to local storage and then load an image-", "I have also downloaded a Haddock picture. And let me show you what I did.", "I generated a 2D array with some images with just one line of code! I was fascinated by that.", "Working with images is very intuitive and easy in Julia.", "You can treat images, parts of images like you treat any other elements in other programming languages.", "Let me show you. But before that, I would like you to know that Julia comes with an RGB \u2018colorspace\u2019 that lets you store a color to a variable and use it elsewhere.", "I downloaded a picture of this guy and stored into a variable:", "You can get the size and crop it very easily through Julia.", "What\u2019s interesting here, you can access each pixel or a group of pixels and manipulate them as you wish.", "Here, I just took some pixels and assigned them the value red, which is a color. And it was so simple and seamless.", "You can do more interesting stuff like making a blue light filter.", "I wrote a function and applied it to the picture. It was straightforward. And functions like this can be applied to a group of images, too- making it useful in data augmentation in Computer Vision training sets. There could be other fascinating applications to Computer Vision problems.", "Not only can you do pixel-level operations in Julia in an effortless manner, but you can also manipulate them in many ways.", "Again, I see the application of this in augment transformation in the training of Neural Networks in Deep Learning.", "As a user of Jupyter, I could not help but notice", "In Jupyter Notebook, until you run a cell, the changes in the contents of the cell (variables, methods, classes, etc.) do not get reflected.", "But Pluto and Julia do that automatically.", "Now, this is a more nuanced issue. And for me, the jury is still out whether this will end up being helpful.", "You can convert Pluto notebooks to PDF without any significant loss. Pluto\u2019s PDF support is laudable.", "For full code, (and to see that Julia creates flawless PDF files) you can download the two notebooks involved here (Dropbox link) \u2014", "I could move around Jupyter without having to touch the mouse, but that is not possible in Pluto. There are only a few shortcuts and mouses are indispensable. I can\u2019t say I like that about Pluto. But looks like they are working on it.", "Julia has a simple and effective package manager that is accessible from inside Pluto and from the command line.", "I prefer the command line, any day.", "As you can see, I have barely scratched the surface here. I have used Julia and Pluto for only one day. And I have shared what I have experienced, what I liked, and what I disliked.", "A lot (if not all) is left for me to explore. And I am looking forward to that!", "You can check out the TEDx Talk at MIT where one of the co-founders shares his vision for the language.", "Your home for data science.
