To make sense of this vast volume of heterogeneous data, a variety of aggregation and fusion steps have to be applied to achieve semantic data enrichment for subsequent use in value-added services. However, enabling these enrichment steps generally relies on stable and highly scalable data handling and storage infrastructures. However, with ever-increasing volumes of spatio-temporal data relational database technology (even with special object-relational extensions for spatio-temporal data) is stretched to its limits and currently new paradigms commonly referred to as \u2018Not Only SQL\u2019 (NoSQL) databases are tried out as more scalable replacements, for example, MongoDB + GeoJSON or GeoMesa.", "However, although many categories of data are interpreted as graph structures today, traditional relational databases still lack the architecture and high-level query languages to effectively model and manipulate such structures. Graph databases are designed to represent data as attributes on vertices and edges. They are often schema-less (i.e., there is no fixed data structure) and their attributes are described as simple key-value pairs. Thus, a major strength of graph databases is that they excel in complex join-style queries where relational databases are notoriously inefficient for large tables. In contrast, graph databases tend to perform poorly when moving from local subgraphs to full graph aggregate queries, where relational database technology plays out its strength. Among the ranks of commercial ML/AI and natural language processing, Gartner has identified graph analytics as one of the top 10 data analytics trends of 2019.", "This research investigates the suitability of which database technology is best suited to handle large-scale, spatio-temporal data in typical data manipulation tasks under real-world settings. In particular, the investigation will cover the query speed, expressiveness of the available query languages, and computational demand on the open-source graph database JanusGraph (with Cassandra and ElasticSearch), the open source object-relational database system PostgreSQL, and the enterprise-level graph analytics platform TigerGraph.", "Our contributions can be summarized as follows:", "PostgreSQL was chosen as our control database due to its industry-proven suitability for spatio-temporal data when coupled with PostGIS. We chose two graph databases with differing underlying architectures, namely Java and C++, and compared how they performed against our control database and with respect to each other. Despite this choice in databases, there are other notable mentions such as GeoMesa and TerraLib as proven suitable alternatives for the analysis of spatio-temporal data.", "To allow for a fair and authoritative evaluation, on the one hand, we use a real world data set for benchmarking. On the other hand, we use a simulation dataset offering more control to test the limits of the database technology used. For the real world data, Yelp is an internationally operating business directory service and review forum. The \u2018Yelp dataset\u2019 is a current subset of Yelp\u2019s businesses, reviews, and user data comprising spatio-temporal data for 10 metropolitan areas across two countries with about 200,000 businesses and 6.6 million reviews. It is offered for academic use in the yearly Yelp challenge, for a variety of data analysis and discovery tasks.", "In contrast, the ambulance response simulation dataset from Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden, offers more control over the scenario \u2014 given a number of hospital resources such as dispatch centres and ambulances, it simulates how emergency calls would be responded to by ambulances. The dataset records spatio-temporal properties such as the time intervals within the response life cycle and the origin and destination of the resource during the response. Other technical properties regarding the emergency itself are also recorded. In summary, we evaluated on two datasets with different representations of spatio-temporal properties, complexities from additional attributes, and total size.", "For the benchmarking, we designed a web-application on spatio-temporal data called Providentia. It is used to queue analysis tasks in a pipeline on which each benchmark is to be run, server performance measured, and accumulated results displayed. The architecture and how each technology communicates is illustrated in Figure 1. The databases are containerized using Docker.", "Our first motivation towards using a commonplace Python backend is to make analysis setting realistic for the benchmark. Another advantage is that a simple REST API can be easily and quickly designed and deployed using the Flask framework. Angular was subjectively chosen as the front end framework as it allows for fast front end web development. All benchmarking results are stored in a separate database within PostgreSQL.", "Unfortunately, JanusGraph has some Java-specific features that add limitations when making use of embedded Gremlin in Python. The limitations are, when trying to make use of mixed indexing search predicates such as spatial queries, that one may only do this via Java or a superset language thereof. The workaround for this was to make use of the Gremlin Translator which takes a Gremlin query as a string and interprets it on the server-side.", "One can view the code for Providentia on its GitHub repository.", "Kernels represent some kind of user story for data analysis, in particular featuring some spatio-temporal constraint which will be applied on the respective queries. Each of these kernels will be benchmarked 30 times each, thus the mean and standard deviation can be considered when comparing response times. There are 6 kernels in total and each dataset runs 3 kernels on each.", "All experiments were run on two setups detailed in Table 1. Using these setups made it possible to consider how the technologies utilize multiple cores and perform with different storage limitations. Each database was run as a single node.", "JanusGraph can be seen to be far outperformed by the other two database technologies in terms of response times in Figure 2. This is a trend that features in all three queries regarding the medical response dataset. Another trend is that TigerGraph and PostgreSQL perform closely where TigerGraph responds the fastest.", "Each database appears to perform much more consistently (see Figure 3) with lower deviation as opposed to its performance in Figure 2. JanusGraph appears to have some kind of consistent overhead between the three containers (JanusGraph, Cassandra, and ElasticSearch) which appears to affect the response time.", "This is only a temporal query and one can see in Figure 4 that TigerGraph and PostgreSQL perform much more similar than in the previous two queries. This suggests that added complexity from constraints in a query perform better in TigerGraph than in PostgreSQL.", "Figure 5 shows a linear growth in the response time of PostgreSQL whereas JanusGraph and TigerGraph remain fairly horizontal for increasing volumes of data. Due to the complexity of this query it comes as no surprise that the graph databases outperform their relational counterpart. TigerGraph outperforms both PostgreSQL and JanusGraph in terms of query response time and shows a very high consistency as there is almost no standard deviation around the mean.", "Figure 6 shows that JanusGraph performs poorly in relation to the other two database technologies with high deviation around the mean. PostgreSQL scales horizontally for this kernel which is most likely be due to the query being the simplest of the three kernels. Still, TigerGraph outperforms both.", "Figure 7 shows both graph database technologies outperform PostgreSQL as PostgreSQL shows linear growth, as it did in Figure 5. For the experiments on 13% of the dataset, JanusGraph shows a lot of deviation around the mean. This may be due to all the moving parts on which JanusGraph is implemented on and its multi-level caching implementation behaving poorly at this size of the dataset.", "The memory consumption of each database (while idle) is illustrated in Figure 8 and clearly shows the high cost of graph database technology with TigerGraph and JanusGraph using about 2 GiB and 10 GiB respectively. PostgreSQL only makes use of around 9 MiB which makes is extremely lighter than the graph databases.", "The technologies used for JanusGraph all run on the JVM and, given the 32 GB memory available, allowed the JVM\u2019s garbage collector to run infrequently. Most of the memory used by JanusGraph is the cache for ElasticSearch, Cassandra, and JanusGraph, each storing an independent cache. Most of the fluctuations in memory came from the JanusGraph container and this happens from the moment the container is run. This cache can be limited by configurations, but our results are from an unlimited cache setup.", "Memory for TigerGraph and PostgreSQL were held constant (as their lower and upper memory bounds were within MiB differences) as the majority of these two databases are written in C or C++, which requires manual memory management. It is important to note that while JanusGraph uses a lot of memory, there are other graph database variants adhering to the Apache TinkerPop standard which claim to be more efficient in terms of memory such as Neo4j and OrientDB. Neo4j and OrientDB memory consumption is also configurable, but may still use multiple GiB of memory because of the JVM.", "In this paper, we analyzed and compared the response times of three database technologies with respect to handling interconnected spatio-temporal data. The technologies compared were two open-source database technologies, PostgreSQL and JanusGraph, and one enterprise-level technology, TigerGraph. The linear growth in the relational model was clearly illustrated in the results whereas the graph database solutions scaled more horizontally. This can be attributed mostly to the improved scalability of NoSQL database over traditional relational models when querying large volumes of data. The three systems were evaluated by employing a set of spatio-temporal queries similar to those that would be found in real world scenarios when analysing data in a dataset such as the Yelp Challenge Dataset and the Ambulance Simulation Dataset.", "In particular, our results prove that for spatio-temporal data, graph database technology outperforms PostgreSQL in all kernels used in our experiments. This result is partially due to the fact that the kernels produce complex queries due to the interconnected nature of the data. This dataset produced a dense graph on which graph databases have the ability to perform effective traversals, compared to multi-join style queries produced by the relational implementation. The spatio-temporal multi-dimensional aspect has shown to be supported well in all of the databases, as evident by the response times of the queries with constraints of this nature.", "This is a more concise version of my paper written with Brink Van Der Merwe and Wolf-Tilo Balke. The full text with a comprehensive list of references and the database queries measured can be found at MDPI for free.", "If you are interested in seeing some of my other work, then have a look at my personal page. Similarly, there are pages to find out more about my co-authors Brink and Wolf-Tilo.", "If you would like tools for cleaning the Yelp dataset or getting started with the Yelp dataset for TigerGraph or Neo4j have a look at the following repositories:", "Your home for data science.
