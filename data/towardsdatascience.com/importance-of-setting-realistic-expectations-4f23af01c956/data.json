That way once your model is built, it can be deployed swiftly and start making an impact sooner."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://stakion.io", "anchor_text": "https://stakion.io", "paragraph_index": 19}], "all_paragraphs": ["It seems like every company is now building Data Science teams and investing in Machine Learning platforms, either third party or built in-house.", "However research has shown that few companies are deploying Machine Learning models to production [1]. While technical complexity plays a part, unrealistic expectations are also to blame.", "Developing Machine Learning models requires a big investment. You need to hire Data Scientists, invest in Big Data tools and build / buy model serving platforms. As a result, the expectations are often high, sometimes too high.", "In order to ensure the success of an AI project, Data Scientists need to make sure they set realistic expectations before they even start building a model. If the expectations are unattainable, you will get approval to develop models but they will never make it into production.", "Setting expectations can be complicated but there are a few things you can do to help steer the conversation:", "Machine Learning models usually replace or automate existing processes. Look into those processes and try to quantify its overall performance (accuracy, false positive / negative rates, time to prediction, etc). This will give you a baseline of what your model will need to be able to achieve.", "Unless your model matches the performance of existing processes, it will not be deployed no matter the cost savings", "Don\u2019t spend too much looking into the overall cost of the solution, focus more on the performance of the overall model. The goal here is not to define how much the business could save by implementing a Machine Learning solution, it is about learning what level of performance your model is expected to reach.", "When setting expectations, the first metric we think about is accuracy. It is easy to understand and is usually a god starting point when talking with product owners.", "However, agreeing an a target accuracy is not enough. In nearly every application, the cost to the business of a false positive is different than the cost of a false negative. In a lot of cases, the costs can be an order of magnitude apart !", "Take the case of fraud prediction for example. Let\u2019s assume you sell a product for \u00a3100 with 20% profit margin. This means that one sale will generate \u00a320 of profit, but if someone buys the product using a stolen card you will be 80\u00a3 out of pocket (production costs) plus fees charged by payment processors (which can be in the \u00a320 range). In this case the cost of a false positive is \u00a320 while the cost of a false positive is \u00a3100 ! As a result your model can theoretically have a false negative rate that is 5 times higher than the false positive rate and will still be profitable.", "Deploying a Machine Learning model involves a lot of moving pieces, ranging from serving to monitoring. The first model you deploy will have to be relatively simple as the focus will be on the infrastructure and processes surrounding the model.", "The first iteration of a model is about setting up processes, not about performance", "Before spending too much time on anything else, start developing a very simple model with little to no feature engineering. Assume that this will be the first model to be deployed.", "If the simple model does not come close to achieving the metrics agreed with the product owner during phase 1 and 2, there are two approaches you can take:", "Choosing between these options will depend on your organisation and how strategic the model you are developing is. In any case, don\u2019t proceed without having talking to product owners first. It might not seems like much but this could speed up the development cycle 10 fold.", "In order for Machine Learning models to be widely adopted in an organisations, Data Science teams need to engage the business during before they build the first model.", "Agreeing performance metrics at the beginning of a project and regularly checking in with product owners will help ensure that models are deployed swiftly.", "Your home for data science.
