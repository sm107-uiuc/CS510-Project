There were many great questions, but most were related to how to most effectively establish an AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in a large organization.", "This gave me an opportunity to reflect on my own experiences helping large enterprise accelerate their AI/Machine Learning journey, and, more specifically, assess what worked, and perhaps just as importantly, what did not work. I have condensed these into a few simple \u201clessons learned\u201d that hopefully will be useful to you on your organization\u2019s AI/ML journey.", "In my experience, your models will never be perfect. So, don\u2019t try to make them perfect. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 model accuracy (or whichever metric applies in your case) is important, but the getting the absolute best model probably only counts in Kaggle competitions.", "Rather, your focus should be to make your models good enough to meet the business need. The fact of the matter is almost all enterprises consider getting a perfect model a very distant second to getting a \u201cgood enough\u201d model into production where it can deliver value. So, my advice is quite simple: figure out what is \u201cgood enough\u201d for your organization and focus on getting models into production.", "This is a fundamental but largely unrecognized fact: today, the vast majority of time in data science in enterprises is not really spent on data science. Rather, most of the time \u2014 upwards of 90% of the time from my experience \u2014 is spent doing other things, including: acquiring data, engineering data and feature sets, addressing security concerns, setting up infrastructure (cloud, or data center) or workstations, packaging models for production, and creating DEVOPS scripts to migrate a completed model into product\u2026 and this is not a complete list!", "The unfortunate thing is that in most immature organizations (which is to say most organizations recognizing the relative \u201cnewness\u201d or AI/ML) this additional non-data-science work is experienced literally on every project.", "Is this a big deal? Absolutely, it is. Let\u2019s say your group\u2019s budget is $1 million (a nice round number, which makes the math really easy), that means that someone \u2014 in many cases your high-priced data scientists \u2014 are spending 90%, or $900,000, on tasks not directly related to what you hired them for. That is a lot of money! Not only is this painful to hear, but even more painful to experience!", "So, how can you avoid this pain? Well, that leads to my next lesson\u2026", "As I highlighted earlier, far too many projects are spending far too much time on tasks not directly related to AI/ML.", "First, let\u2019s not confuse the what I mean by an \u201cAI/ML Platform. It is not just the environment and toolkit offered by the cloud vendors. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the tools that AWS, Azure, and Google offers \u2014 you really can\u2019t do AI/ML effectively without them. However, there are material considerations that the cloud vendor tools do not address. In other words, cloud vendor tools are necessary, but not sufficient.", "So, then, what is an \u201cAI/ML Platform\u201d? Simply put, the purpose of an AI/ML Platform is to accelerate getting AI/ML models into production. It the \u201cglue\u201d \u2014 the scripts, security policies, operability concerns, and self-provisioning infrastructure \u2014 that are implemented on top of the AI/ML environments and tools.", "In simple terms, the AI/ML Marketplace is a catalog of all artifacts related to AI/ML models that enables model reproducibility, traceability, explainability, and verifiability:", "Simply put, the AI/ML Marketplace is the catalog and repository that facilitates modern AI/ML development, management, and governance by fully addressing reproducibility, traceability, verifiability, and explainability.", "In most enterprises, I see computing platforms and data/storage volumes scale well beyond internal data center capabilities. GPU farms are not on the agenda. Tripling and quadrupling storage farms is underway. But the fact of the matter is that even large organizations have proven unable to keep up.", "Accenture, a large international consulting firm, says there are few issues: First, \u201cuntil now, there hasn\u2019t been a proven blueprint for scaling, and organizations can fall into some common traps.\u201d Second, \u201cthe unfamiliar landscape of AI also means businesses can be tempted to fall back on their time-honored behaviors, reinventing the wheel and building from scratch.\u201d Lastly, \u201cThere are many proven, low-cost AI options to buy off-the-shelf and start using right away.\u201d", "So why fight it when there are other more capable, cost effective, scalable, and current options available with the large cloud vendors? My simple advice is this: push aside the critics and get your cloud-native AI/ML program started!", "Most organizations, especially those moving AI/ML to the cloud, have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to structure their organization for success. My vision \u2014 that which I have seen work in large enterprises \u2014 is to \u201cdemocratize AI/ML\u201d. By this I mean that any group (assuming they have the skills) should be able to build AI/ML models any time, at any speed, using any tools and libraries they need.", "But how do you scale and manage this type of organization construct? Simplistically, the fundamental requirement is that necessary guardrails require for scale and management are implemented in the AI/ML Platform and the AI/ML Marketplace. With this in mind, the following is a practical set of groups within an AI/ML organization:", "My objective in this article was to provide a few simple lessons learned that will help you accelerate your enterprise\u2019s AI/ML journey and avoid some of the speed bumps and potholes I have experienced. Hopefully I have achieved this objective.", "But one thing I can say for sure is that things are moving fast. Technology and approaches will likely evolve, and in all likelihood, I should probably think about writing a new version of this a year from now. Or maybe, after a year, you will be able to write a few lessons learned from your organizations AI/ML journey!", "Your home for data science.
