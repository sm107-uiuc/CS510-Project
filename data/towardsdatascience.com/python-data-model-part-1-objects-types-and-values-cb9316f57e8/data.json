The developers of the language have dedicated fairly bigger documentation that might be a bit ambiguous, intimidating, or vague at the first look.", "However, in simple words, the term data model is self-explanatory \u2014 it deals with how Python organizes everything internally to treat and process data as well as some high-level concepts of its core design and philosophy. It discusses the basic building blocks of the language itself, the design/structure of the building blocks, and the basic code-blocks that come into play with them.", "In this chapter, we will talk about Objects, types, and values", "In Python \u2014 Everything is an object. Each object has an identity, a type, and a value", "In Python \u2014 Everything is an object. Each object has an identity, a type, and a value. So, what is the fuss with identity, type, and value? We are going to write some simple code \u2014", "We can think of identity as an object\u2019s address in memory", "Here, the id() gives us the identity that we were talking about, which is a unique integer that never changes during the lifetime of an object. We can think of identity as an object\u2019s address in memory. We can check if two objects are the same with is operator.", "Now, if we want to check the type of these objects, we can use type().", "The type of an object cannot change", "The type of an object cannot change\u00b9", "\u00b9It is possible in some cases to change an object\u2019s type, under certain controlled conditions.

Here 53 is the value of age and Maradona is the value of player_1 . The value of an object can be changed if the object is mutable and if the object is immutable the value of it cant be changed.", "That means the age = 53 is an integer type object with value 53 and has the id 9753824 and if we now change the age to 54 , it will be referring to a different object", "So, if we want to change the value of player_1 then both objects player_copy and player_1 will not show the same identity", "So, both player_1 aka string and age aka integers are immutable types. There are other immutable types. such as \u2014 integers, floats, strings, tuples. On the other hand, mutable types are lists, dictionaries, and sets. Now, looking into the mutable types", "As both players and players_copy referring to the same list object, changes in one list will have an effect on the other variable.", "In the above example, we mutated the players list by changing the first value and using append() method. As both players and players_copy referring to the same list object, changes in one list will have an effect on the other variable.", "Note that, if we change the list a variable referring to, it will create a new list object.

We can tell by checking both the ids.", "To get a more clear understanding of mutability and immutability, let's bring tuple in the firing zone. As we said earlier, tuples are immutable, mutating tuples types shouldn't be possible.", "In this part, we tried to get a clear understanding of how an object holds its essence in the pythonic world and the differences between mutability and immutability.
