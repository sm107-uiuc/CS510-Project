The easiest way to do this is of course SQL.", "The good news is that if you don\u2019t like working with MySql or other relational database management systems (RDBMS), you can still do the majority of your work from your comfy Jupyter thanks to SQLAlchemy!", "Cloud Services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud are usually the easiest way to deploy your models, which makes them desired skills when applying for Data Science positions. Having even basic experience with one of them gives you a good head start in your Data Science journey.", "Well\u2026 you have completed several Coursera courses, participated in Kaggle competitions, and mastered Scikit-Learn but Cloud Services sound like something complicated and hard to master yourself? You couldn\u2019t be more wrong\u2026 compared to understanding the basics of Machine Learning it\u2019s a piece of cake. With this little extra work, you can really boost your skills in creating E2E projects.", "In this article, I aim to show you how to easily get started with AWS environment and use it to create your private RDS. I choose AWS as I believe it has one of the greatest learning material and ease of use. It also has good pricing when it comes to small-scale learning projects \u2014 you can get nearly everything for free. However, take caution in which services you choose \u2014 I would recommend checking Billing for a few days after any change to ensure that you are not being charged too much at the end of the month.", "In future articles, I will also focus on other aspects of AWS such as EC2 combined with Docker for the stable deployment of your models. As data is not the first word in Data Science by accident I decided that building a stable data foundation will save you time and nerves in the future.", "If you are already professionally working with data you are probably familiar with your Company\u2019s relational databases. However, I believe that at least basic knowledge of the whole data pipeline comes in handy including setting up a database.", "On the other hand, Data Science demands constant learning, and working on private projects is an important part of that journey. For that single reason, I would recommend you to set up your private Database.", "I myself spend nearly two years building my own portfolio of projects based on csv and json inputs stored locally or on GitHub and believe me that after some time all the input and output files become such a mess that I really wish I created my private DB earlier.", "Setting up a database on AWS RDS takes about 10 mins and doesn\u2019t require any experience: all you need to do is to follow this brilliant onboarding material from AWS itself \u2014 they do such a good job that I will not even try to write about it myself because there is no way it would be any clearer. Set up your Database following the instructions below up to the end of Step 1 \u2014 we will follow on with Step 2 directly from Python:", "Remember to choose the free tier, write down the chosen password (no way to retrieve it if you lose it), and set Publicly Accessible to Yes \u2014 (you need to expand additional connectivity configuration). Another important part to remember is to set up a Database name in step e \u2014 omitting this makes it harder further down the road. Once you are ready we can do the remaining work in cozy Jupyter Notebook.", "Congratulations! You have created your own private cloud-based Relation Database. Now let\u2019s connect our Jupyter notebook to the database with SQL-Alchemy. The code and data for this part of the article are available at GitHub.", "First, we need to define key 4 parameters, which allow SQLAlchemy to connect to AWS RDS.", "Once we have that sorted all we need to do is to establish a connection with this simple query", "Now we are connected and ready to write some data to our database!", "Currently, our database is empty and we need to populate it. For purpose of this tutorial I will use a small sample of London rent data scrapped from Right move: if you are interested in the topic you can read more about it in my article Beginners Guide to Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup on London rent listings.", "Currently, all the data is stored in one stack but this is not very scalable \u2014 let\u2019s split it into 3 tables to leverage SQL advantages. We will be able to join the data based on \u201cid\u201d key. It is worth making sure that key columns have int type as joining on floats is slower and may cause difficulties due to rounding errors.", "Splitting our data into separate tables has one big advantage, we can save storage space \u2014 in this case, we can be quite confident that once we have data about property location and its characteristics, it is unlikely to change. However Prices can change more often, that\u2019s why I only included download_time in table_price \u2014 we can append prices updated without having to append location and property data we already have to other tables.", "Now that we have prepared the data, we can write it to our database. We do not need to worry about cursors, data types, and such, we can just use pd.to_sql.", "I choose chunksize of 100 to write data in batches but you can also write it all at once if the volumes are not significant.", "Here we are, we have populated the first 3 Tables: PROPERTIES, LOCATIONS, and PRICES in our database.", "The last step we must take to test out data foundation is to query the saved data so that we don\u2019t need to use the csv file again. Let\u2019s write a simple query in which we join all the tables on \u201cid\u201d and execute it.", "We managed to retrieve and join property data stored in our database. This dataset is very simple and has no major advantages of being stored in a Relational Database but with larger, more complex datasets that are frequently updated it has a huge advantage and you can use exactly the same methods as demonstrated here.", "To make your database scalable you will probably need more than a single schema, which is pretty much like a folder within your database. You can also add it from within Python. You will however need to install sqlalchemy_utils library. All you need to do is to create another connection using the name of the new Schema. Then you test if the schema is already present and if not create it \u2014 similar to checking for the folder and creating it if needed while working locally.", "In this brief article, I aimed to demonstrate how you can quickly get started with AWS RDS and build stable data foundations for your projects, while still keeping all major steps within a notebook with the use of SQL Alchemy.", "I hope this approach will help you to build scalable Data Science projects and avoid chaos in your data stored in dozens of different files.", "This article is the first out of a series I am planning to write on AWS so if you are interested in this topic please follow my profile so you don\u2019t miss out!", "Thanks for your time!
