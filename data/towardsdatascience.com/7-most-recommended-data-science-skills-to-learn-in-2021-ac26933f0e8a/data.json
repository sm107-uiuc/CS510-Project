I\u2019m specifically not referring to data from scraped job postings because from my experiences, there seems to be quite a disconnect between job descriptions and what\u2019s actually done on the job.", "You might notice that none of the seven skills have anything to do with machine learning or deep learning, and this is not a mistake. Currently, there is a much higher demand for skills that are used in the pre-modeling phases and post-modeling phases. And so, the seven most recommended skills to learn actually overlap with the skills of a data analyst, a software engineer, and a data engineer.", "I wrote an article specifically on why you shouldn\u2019t learn machine learning first \u2014 you can check it out below:", "With that said, let\u2019s dive into the seven most recommended data science skills to learn in 2021:", "SQL is the universal language in the world of data. Whether you\u2019re a data scientist, a data engineer, or a data analyst, you\u2019ll need to know SQL.", "SQL is used to extract data from a database, manipulate data, and create data pipelines \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s important for almost every pre-analysis/pre-modeling stage in the data lifecycle.", "Developing strong SQL skills will allow you to take your analyses, visualizations, and modeling to the next level because you will be able to extract and manipulate the data in advanced ways. Also, writing efficient and scalable queries is becoming more and more important for companies that work with petabytes of data.", "If you think creating data visualizations and storytelling are specific to the role of a data analyst, think again.", "Data visualizations simply refer to data that is presented visually \u2014 it can be in the form of graphs, but it can also be presented in unconventional ways.", "Data storytelling takes data visualizations to the next level \u2014 data storytelling refers to \u201chow\u201d you communicate your insights. Think of it like a picture book. A good picture book has good visuals, but it also has an engaging and powerful narrative that connects the visuals.", "Developing your data visualization and storytelling skills are essential because you\u2019re always selling your ideas and your models as a data scientist. And it\u2019s especially important when communicating with others who are not as technologically savvy.", "From my interactions, Python seems to be the go-to programming language to learn over R. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be a data scientist if you use R, but it just means that you\u2019ll be working in a language that is different from what the majority of people use.", "Learning Python syntax is easy, but you should be able to write efficient scripts and leverage the wide-range of libraries and packages that Python has to offer. Python programming is a building block for applications like manipulating data, building machine learning models, writing DAG files, and more\u2026", "Arguably the most important library to know in Python is Pandas, which a package for data manipulation and analysis. As a data scientist, you\u2019ll be using this package all the time, whether you\u2019re cleaning data, exploring data, or manipulating the data.", "Pandas has become such a prevalent package, not only because of it\u2019s functionality, but also because DataFrames have become a standard data structure for machine learning models.", "Git is the main version control system that is used in the tech community.", "If that doesn\u2019t make sense, consider this example. In high school or university, if you ever had to write an essay, you might have saved different versions of your essay as you progressed through it. For example:", "All jokes aside, Git is a tool that serves the same purpose, except that it\u2019s a distributed system. This means that files (or repositories) are stored both locally and in a central server.", "Git is extremely important for several reasons, with a few being that:", "Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to deploy and run applications, like machine learning models.", "It\u2019s becoming increasingly important that data scientists not only know how to build models but how to deploy them as well. In fact, a lot of job postings are now requiring some experience in model deployment.", "The reason that it\u2019s so important to learn how to deploy models is that a model delivers no business value until it is actually integrated with the process/product that it is associated with.", "Airflow is a workflow management tool that allows you to automate\u2026 well workflows. More specifically Airflow allows you to create automated workflows for data pipelines and machine learning pipelines.", "Airflow is powerful because it allows you productionalize tables that you may want to use for further analysis or modeling, and it\u2019s also a tool that you can use to deploy machine learning models.", "I hope that this helps guide your learnings and gives you some direction for the new year. This is a lot to learn so I would definitely choose a couple of skills that sound most interesting to you and go from there.", "Do keep in mind that this more of an opinionated article that is backed by anecdotal experience, so take what you want from this article. But as always, I wish you the best in your learning endeavors!", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
