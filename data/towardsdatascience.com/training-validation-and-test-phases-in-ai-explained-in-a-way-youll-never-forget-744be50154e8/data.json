Imagine that Mr. Bean is about to take his first calculus exam\u2026", "Mr. Bean unearths the single equation he squirreled away and begins studying it for tomorrow\u2019s exam. He\u2019s got no other examples (datapoints) or resources to help him along and he didn\u2019t bother to write down any explicit rules explaining how calculus works, so all he can try doing is search for patterns in his equation:", "Just like an AI algorithm, his goal is to find a data pattern that he can turn into a recipe (\u201cmodel\u201d) that successfully takes him from the input on the left of the \u201c=\u201d to the output on the right-hand side. That is precisely what goes on during the training and tuning steps of an applied AI project (steps 6\u20137 in my step-by-step guide).", "Training is all about making a recipe out of patterns in the available examples.", "So let\u2019s take a careful look at that example again\u2026 can we see any patterns?", "Eureka! Mr. Bean found one! Just grab that 8, turn it on its side, and there\u2019s the answer.", "That recipe certainly works on this example. It fits perfectly. Congratulations! Should Mr. Bean rush straight to the exam? Based on some of the undergraduate exams I\u2019ve graded, the answer is not obvious. But I bet that you \u2014 my dear enlightened reader \u2014 are better than that. You would prefer to do something else first if you were Mr. Bean, right?", "I can almost hear you shouting all the way from here. \u201cTRY ANOTHER EXAMPLE!!!\u201d Exactly! The difference between you and Mr. Bean is that you\u2019ll both try another one\u2026 but you\u2019re smart enough to do it before the exam. In other words, in a low-stakes setting with room for redemption rather than a high-stakes one where there\u2019s no take-backsies.", "That\u2019s exactly what validation (step 8) in machine learning is. Validation creates a safe, low-stakes opportunity for students to try their recipes on examples they haven\u2019t studied explicitly. That\u2019s how they get a signal about whether they\u2019re ready for the real exam.", "Validation gives your project some room for redemption.", "(Mr. Bean is very lucky to have a professor like you. Thank you for sending him additional examples to try in the comfort and safety of his dorm room!)", "So, Mr. Bean is about to try a new one. Let\u2019s validate!", "He turns that 5 on its side and boom! An answer is served.", "Then he checks the performance against the correct answer you supplied and\u2026", "Sadly, that\u2019s not how math works.", "Mr. Bean saw how badly his model performs and he has a choice: start over or go to the exam anyway.", "If he chooses to start over, he might go back to training (step 6) and search for new patterns in the data he already has (that single paltry datapoint) or he might go even further back and consider adjusting the data he\u2019s working with (if it were me, I\u2019d be begging you for a bunch of additional examples, which would mean going all the way back to step 2 in my guide).", "Students (and ML/AI engineers) are allowed to bounce back and forth between looking for patterns and validating their new recipes as much as they like. (But don\u2019t stay up all night studying!)", "Finally, at 3 AM, Mr. Bean found a pattern that works correctly on all the validation examples you\u2019ve given him.", "You receive the following email at 3:08 AM:", "I\u2019ve discovered a recipe that works 100% perfectly on those validation examples you gave me. I\u2019m probably the best calculus student you\u2019ve ever had. How about we save time and I skip your exam? You can just give me my A+ while I sleep in.", "Why not? By answering that, you\u2019ll have answered why every self-respecting applied ML/AI project needs validation AND testing.", "Every self-respecting applied ML/AI project needs validation AND testing.", "Mr. Bean might be fooling himself into thinking that he understands those equations when he actually doesn\u2019t. For all you know, he might have hacked together a crazy recipe that overfits, er, contorts itself to fit those specific examples he has been staring at all night. Perhaps he has just memorized all the answers and that\u2019s his recipe \u2014 looking them up from memory. There\u2019s no guarantee he understands anything general enough to handle new problems.", "So let\u2019s not take his word for it. A key principle in ML/AI is that we never trust\u2026 we test.", "The proof of the ML/AI pudding is always in the eating.", "If Mr. Bean tried to talk me into giving him a pass by telling me his recipe or \u201cunderstanding\u201d\u2014well, that\u2019s cute, but like all experienced applied AI folk who\u2019ve been around long enough to get burned, I won\u2019t trust him until he shows me how well he performs the task on new examples he has never seen before. (Though understanding his recipe can help me help him improve it, so explainability is very handy in the training phase.)", "A key principle in ML/AI is that we never trust\u2026 we test.", "Sure, Mr. Bean tried his best and his final recipe reflects his best understanding. That doesn\u2019t mean he deserves to pass. Unfortunately, sometimes a student\u2019s (or system\u2019s) best is not good enough. Maybe his examples (data) weren\u2019t informative enough, maybe he didn\u2019t have enough datapoints to be able to uncover useful patterns (just one example was never going to be enough for learning how to solve limit calculus problems, sorry), or maybe his algorithm \u2014 er, brain \u2014 couldn\u2019t find the winning recipe. Tough luck for Mr. Bean \u2014 not every student or AI system is going to succeed when the task is challenging to learn. That\u2019s life.", "So, is Mr. Bean\u2019s best good enough? Should you give him a pass to go on to the next step (where you productionize him for mathematics in the wild) or should you delicately suggest he switch majors?", "The testing phase allows you find out how well your student has learned the task.", "Let\u2019s find out by inviting him to a high-stakes exam where he will try his recipe on new examples he could not have memorized\u2026 If he fails this one, it\u2019s game over. Good luck, Mr. Bean!", "This article was Part 1 of 2. The story continues here.", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
