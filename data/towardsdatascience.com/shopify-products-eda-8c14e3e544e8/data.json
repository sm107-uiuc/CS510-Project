Most of these achievements are owed to the advance of deep learning that needs a large amount of training data. Although there are many huge general multimedia datasets, most of the ecommerce specific public datasets are hardly surprising.", "Shopgram.io is where we have started to analyze the ecommerce market by collecting the data of online stores created by Shopify, which are a representative sample of the worldwide ecommerce market. In Shopify Stores EDA, I introduced Shopify as one of the largest ecommerce platforms with many data science potentials and discussed how we crawled the information of more than 700K stores and 70M products, as well as stores EDA. In this document, my main focus is on products, where I first explain product data structure, then I talk about data cleaning, and finally, I give some basic EDA, especially on popular product types in Shopify stores, together with their average price.", "Assuming we have shop URLs, finding product information is not a hard task. In fact, Shopify provides an open API which gives products data in JSON format through the URL {shop-url}/products.json?limit=250&page={i}. Having all products, we can build a large multi-modal dataset (text & image) and later use it for data mining purposes.", "Each product in Shopify data model has an integer id which is unique among all products, title, handle which is used in the product URL, vendor which is the name of its provider, product_type which is the type of product and determined by the merchant, and tags, options, variants, and images described in the following.", "Tag is an internal Shopify concept and invisible to customers. It is used to improve the customer search experience and also to do bulk actions such as building automatic collections. Products may also have from zero to three options. Each option has a name and a list of values. For example, a hoodie may have two options: size and color with three values for the size (S, M, L) and two values for the color (Black, White). In this way, we have 6 variants. Variants are built by combining options. Each variant has a title which is the concatenation of option values separated by backslash (e.g. S / Black), sku which is a string, price (without currency), compare_at_price, option1, option2, option3 (which are the value of options), and featured_image which is an image. As one product may have different variants, it can have also different images. Each image has an id, src which is the URL of the image, width, height, and variant_ids.", "Many data science problems can be defined by utilizing these features. We are going to use text and image data mutually and build a multi-modal deep neural network to classify e-commerce products or compare similar products. But in the following, I will explain how we utilized product_type and price features the discover the most popular product types in Shopify, together with their price statistics.", "Product type is one of the most interesting features among all features as it can be used to label products. However, it is difficult to use because different merchants may use different names for one specific type: Tshirt, tshirt, T-shirt, t-shirt, tee, \u2026 all for the t-shirt.", "Analyzing 67M products, we found 1.6M unique product types. Using lemmatization we could decrease this number to 1.4M which is still very large. But the good news is we can just keeping 1128 product types and still have 50% of products (this number was 2515 without lemmatization). These selected product types still need manual cleaning (because for example t-shirt and tshirt are still different) and after doing this, we have 758 clean product labels and build a labeled dataset. Also to build hierarchical product categories, we used the top three levels of eBay categories and labeled our data.", "How about the price feature? As mentioned above, price is the feature of variant data, where the lack of currency information makes it not straight forward to use. In fact, we had found stores currency from stores\u2019 homepages, and joining these data we could have price and currency. Normalizing all prices to the US Dollar (using 2020 currency ratios) and removing outliers gives us the clean price data. Now we can explore the popular product types in Shopify stores, and have price statistics per category.", "Now, I am going to present basic statistics of cleaned product data, which can be interesting for Shopify merchants who is going to select new products and entrepreneurs who would like to start a new business. Let\u2019s check the popular product types in Shopify stores. The following figure shows the 17 most popular types which cover 40% of all products. This number is 58 and 170 for 60% and 80% respectively.", "Also considering the first level eBay categories, 75% of all products are from the following four categories:", "Price analysis is another engaging information for merchants who need to compare and analyze price in a specific industry. Considering just the top 58 product types which cover 60% of products and sorting them based on their price median, which is more robust to noise, the following two figures show the most expensive and affordable popular product types, respectively.", "Involving time as another dimension, we can analyze these statistics through time, which shows the popularity of top in 2020 and the slight drop of earring and necklace. This trend is also can be observed in their prices in Fig. 7.", "In addition to these statistics, much more information can be extracted through product data and especially from their texts using NLP methods, which will be investigated more in Shopgram.io future posts.", "Your home for data science.
