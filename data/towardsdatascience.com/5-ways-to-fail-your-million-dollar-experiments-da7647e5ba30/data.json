As the saying goes, no business decision shall be made without A/B testing your customers.", "Business experimentation provides rich information about our customer behavior and helps us better understand the gap between customer thinking and behavior.", "People think and behave differently. Often of the time, they tell you one thing and do the direct opposite.", "Without doing experiments, there is no way of knowing how customers would react to the new product. It\u2019s like blind men measuring an elephant\u2019s size: we don\u2019t get the full picture.", "Like any research method, the experimental method has drawbacks and assumptions, but industry folks often run it even when the assumptions are violated. If it happens (unfortunately), we may face the most undesirable case scenario: decision-making with false evidence.", "False information is worse than no evidence.", "We do not make decisions if there is no information, but false information leads to wrong decisions. In today\u2019s post, I elaborate on five common mistakes that may sunk your millions-of-dollars experiments and the coping strategies under each scenario", "(I have contributed several pieces on business experimentation. Check them out: why experiments, natural experiments, ITS, RDD, and DID).", "Here, I\u2019ll try to give you an overview of causal inference & experimentation and why it matters. In day-to-day routine, we ask ourselves questions like: \u201cdoes the new UI increase DAU?\u201d \u201cwhat factors lead to the next million signups?\u201d", "Causal inference is the process of tracing back to the root cause and gauging its effect upon the result of interest.", "Experimentation can help us find the causal effect by holding other factors constant while only changing one variable at a time. If random assignment is not possible, Data Scientists can choose quasi-experimental (Five Tricks) and observational methods (e.g., pairing, propensity scoring matching) to do causal inference.", "Put it simply, causal inference starts with comparable experimental groups and ends with differentiated outcomes. If the experimental groups (treated and control) are not equivalent, to begin with, then the research design is flawed.", "Let\u2019s delve into the main course.", "Data Scientists need to set up a metric to gauge our experiments\u2019 performance, and a lousy metric can kill the experiment.", "For example, the sales number lags for the quarter for a retail company, but the management team still wants to hit the set targets by offering big promotions.", "The Data Team comes up with an experimental design that suggests a 50% discount would do the trick. Should you roll out the promotion as planned?", "The promotion may increase the short-term metrics but dip into the long-term profits as customers shop everything they need for now and don\u2019t have to shop again shortly.", "Choosing valid metrics is as crucial as, if not more, your research design itself. The last thing we want to see is the cannibalism between various sectors.", "As stated above, Data Scientists need to check whether the experimental groups are comparable in key covariates (\u201capples-to-apples comparison\u201d). Otherwise, the result may not stand.", "Certain designs are widely popular in the industry but ill for causal inference. Among which, One Group Before-After-Comparison design and Treated and Non-Treated Groups design stand out!", "Here are two examples of these two designs, respectively. We see a bump in some metrics (e.g., DAU) after rolling out the new UI, so the updated version is the way to go. Compared to the control group, the treated group brings in more revenue, so the treatment works.", "These designs do not offer \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparisons! The treated group may be fundamentally different from the control group, making any direct comparison problematic. It is a typical problem in causal inference called selection bias.", "Also, there is no way of ruling out the possibility of alternative explanations. e.g., there are other significant changes besides the UI update.", "We have carefully chosen the metric that reflects the business interests and intentionally makes the experimental groups comparable. Sweet surprise, there is a positive bump in the metrics. Shall we end the experiment now?", "It\u2019s tempting to do so when there is a positive finding. BTW, this is a common cognitive fallacy \u2014 human beings tend to confirm what we are expecting.", "However, my recommendation is to wait it out and see if the result \u201cregresses to the mean.\u201d The positive jump in the metric may be just a glitch and will disappear after a little longer.", "Here, the key question is: does the treatment group engage with the control group? If so, the result may be contaminated by the spillover effect.", "Hypothetically, the experimentation randomly assigns the treatment to individual users who live nearby. The treatment and control groups may talk to each other, and the control group unintentionally picks up the treatment.", "The fourth mistake is closely related to the last one, as can be seen later.", "For A/B tests and any other experimental designs that adopt randomization, the primary question that Data Scientists should ask: is it really a random assignment?", "It sounds contradictory, but a random process does not guarantee a random assignment!", "There are extraneous factors that cause some groups more likely to participate in the treatment group than others.", "Related to the previous point, a randomization process at the individual URL may be infeasible b/c of cross-contamination. Then, we shall choose the city-level randomization.", "Think carefully about the lowest level of random assignment.", "This post covers the five major ways of failing your experiments: metrics, research design, timing, spillover, and randomization.
