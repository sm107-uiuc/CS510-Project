Almost all of the courses in Reinforcement learning begins with a basic introduction to Q tables and the most intuitive Q tables examples are of grid worlds. That said, many courses only draw their static worlds and provide no playing material to the audience. To counter this, I thought of creating an interactive grid world, where user can define the world, states and agent. This will help user replicate the course\u2019s grid world and understand how it really works and even question \u2014 what happens when you change the fixed variables? Let\u2019s get started!", "The interactive grid world is divided into two main areas,", "Let\u2019s try to understand the dynamics of the grid world by going through the available settings. The settings area can be further divided into,", "\u2014 Size: Select the size of the world. \u201cLarge\u201d means more number of states.", "\u2014 Speed: Select the speed of processing. \u201cFast\u201d is good when we want to get final result quick but \u201cslow\u201d is best for intuitive visualization.", "\u2014 Reward value: The reward assigned to clicked state.", "\u2014 State type: The types of state. \u2018Terminal\u2019 \u2014 basically the game over state, agent completes the current episode when it enters a terminal state. \u2018Wall\u2019 \u2014 a fixed state with no reward, one agent can\u2019t cross. \u2018Normal\u2019 \u2014 the default state type.", "\u2014 Apply to all: Shortcut button to apply the current reward value and state type to all of the boxes in the grid world.", "\u2014 Discount: The discount applied to future rewards. The default value is 0.9.", "\u2014 Deterministic: Defines the deterministic probability of the agent\u2019s actions. 1 means a \u201cright\u201d from a box will always lead to the box on right. Whereas 0.7 means there is only a 70% chance for this to happen and a 10% chance of going to any of the adjacent states. (For math geeks, 3 remaining adjacent states, hence 10 * 3 = 30 % which completes the 100%)", "\u2014 E-greedy: Defines the exploit/explore nature of the agent. 0 means the agent is completely greedy and will always select the best action available. 1 means the agent is completely random and could select from any available actions. To understand more about epsilon-greedy, I would suggest going through my earlier post, Reinforcement learning with multi-arm bandit.", "\u2014 Run/Stop: Let the agent play inside the gridworld. Toggles the switch.", "\u2014 Reset: Go back to the initial settings and dynamics.", "\u2014 Show/Hide policy: Toggle the visibility of policy direction arrows.", "\u2014 Show/Hide Highlight: Toggle the visibility of the current state\u2019s highlight.", "Let take some examples to understand this better.", "Example 1: The first example could be \u201cThe Beer Game\u201d from my earlier post about reinforcement learning with Q tables. I would suggest going through the post to get a basic idea about the Q tables. So the world looks like this,", "And we want the agent to learn to always go to the state with beer rather than the one with a hole. Let\u2019s recreate this in our interactive grid world,", "Finally, the grid world looks like this,", "Example 2: Let\u2019s take one example from Udemy\u2019s Artificial intelligence course. The world looks like this,", "The expected state reward (V) in the above image along with the directions (policy) are learned after going through multiple iterations of training. Let\u2019s try to replicate this world as well,", "Finally the grid world looks like this,", "Compare this with the one shown in the course\u2019s slides, its exactly the same!", "The project is far from over! There are many things that I want to add to this, but I guess they will come with time. The current version may have some bugs, hence in case of any unwanted behavior please resort to the final options \u2014 refresh the page and report issue at GitHub :) Other than that, please go ahead give it a try.", "[1] Udemy\u2019s Artificial Intelligence A-Z\u2122: Learn How To Build An AI", "Your home for data science.
