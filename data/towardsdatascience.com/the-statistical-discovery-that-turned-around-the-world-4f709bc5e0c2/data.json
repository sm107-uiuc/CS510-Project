But during its first appearances in the 18th century, it did not receive the necessary attention, unlike today..."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["As humanity is stepping into the era of advanced super-intelligent technology, several domains are booming as never before. One such domain is DATA SCIENCE that regularly makes use of the very fundamental and profound concept of the CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM (CLT).", "When I started exploring data science, I wondered if the hype for CLT is real?Is it really that mind-boggling a discovery? As I started delving more and more into this field, I found an answer to this question, which many of you must have come across too. But, to get to the answer, it is important to understand what is CLT and what it conveys. You don\u2019t need any in-depth knowledge of statistics to understand this article. If you know what is mean, variance, and standard deviation, you are good to go. If not, I would say just google these terms and you will be ready to comprehend the gist of this article.", "Before we understand CLT, it is important to get familiar with some fundamental concepts that form its basis. So let us begin with Population and Sample.", "There is nothing fancy to these terms. Let us say we want to know what is the average salary of an adult Indian. You go and enquire every Indian adult, i.e. approximately 770 million people, and calculate their average salary. In this case, we have observed the whole \u201cpopulation\u201d with not even a single person left unobserved. Consequently, we can say that the population includes all the possible elements that form a set of data.", "A measurable characteristic of a population, such as a mean or standard deviation, is called a parameter.", "We denote the population mean as \ud835\udf41 and the population Standard Deviation as \ud835\udfbc", "Well, as we have defined what is a population, I don\u2019t think I will have to explain why observing the whole population is impossible under practical circumstances. Hence, the best way we can get an idea about the population is to take a bunch of random people from the population. This random group is known as a sample. I am focusing on the word \u2018random\u2019 because it is crucial that all n objects of the sample are equally likely to be chosen.Imagine if my sample consists of a bunch of software engineers working in Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc. This will not be a precise representation of the whole population. In such a case, we will have a skewed sample. Such a situation is undesirable.", "A measurable characteristic of a\u00a0sample, such as a mean or standard deviation, is called a statistic.We denote the sample mean as X\u0304 and the sample standard deviation as S.", "Great! Now its time for the most important concept that forms the basis for CLT:", "In real-life scenarios, data scientists are dealing with huge volumes of data. Plotting data on a graph makes it easy to understand and to define techniques for measuring its attributes such as mean, variance etc. To understand Normal Distribution, it is important that we understand how graphs are plotted for their relative frequency. The below histogram is drawn for a random sample of 200 software engineers in the USA. The x-axis shows the salary intervals in thousand dollars and the y-axis shows the relative frequency(or Probability) of each interval.", "0The thing to note here is that this works only for a small dataset. When we work with larger data having millions of entries, the interval becomes smaller and smaller. At one time, the interval becomes relatively so small that it can rather be seen as a curve. Have a look at below animation:", "The curve that you see at the end of the animation is the visualization of a distribution where the data points can take on any continuous value. This curve is known as the density curve and the distribution is known as the Normal Distribution(or Gaussian distribution or Bell Curve). It has numerous characteristics that make it unique and useful. A lot of phenomena in the universe follow this distribution. To sense an intuition as to why the distribution shape is such, look at it this way: there are very few students in a class who score very less and a very small number who score very high. The student marks are normally distributed. Similarly, in many other cases, exceptionally high or low values(known as outliers) are rare whereas most of the data is symmetrically distributed bell shape.", "Let us go through some important properties of a normal distribution:", "These properties make normal distributions immensely useful. In my opinion, normal distribution is a magical tool. This magic is mainly because of the magician:", "As we have done till now, we should understand this topic with an example. Consider a large dataset: the population of India. Suppose we want to calculate the mean height of the people of India. Well, as we have already discussed the concept of a population, we cannot observe every data point and calculate its mean. But, what I can ask you is to collect a random sample of sample size = 5 from the population( i.e. just select 5 random people from the population and measure their heights). That\u2019s easy, isn\u2019t it? Suppose 250 people are reading this article right now and all of the readers collect a random sample of sample size = 5. So, now we have 250 samples of sample size = 5.", "Great!Now, calculating the mean of each sample will give us 250 sample means. Now, if we plot these 250 mean values on a frequency distribution, this is what we get:", "I hope you can see the approaching normal distribution. Another amusing result is that the mean(X\u0304) of the above distribution of sample means approximates the Population mean(\ud835\udf41). It means that without analyzing the entire population, we could approximate the mean of the population.", "What if we increase each random sample size from 5 to 25 and see what simulation turns out to be:", "Yes, a more normal distribution(i.e a lesser deviation of the data points from the mean)!!! And this distribution becomes more and more normal as we increase the individual sample size. (Note that we did not increase the number of random samples, i.e. the number of readers of the article are the same, but now each reader collects the sample of size 25 rather than 5). Every time we follow the above steps for any dataset, the distribution of sample means will always be normally distributed! What a wonderful result!", "The distribution of means of the samples shown above is known as the Sampling Distribution of the Sample means(X\u0304).", "Before concluding, I should show you the final simulation when the plot approximates a perfect normal distribution:", "From the above result, it is clear that the sampling distribution of the sample means is more normal when the sample size = 25 than when it was = 5.", "The beauty of CLT is that it works even with a non-normally distributed population. The population may look something like this:", "Or actually, anything that you can imagine. The point is that we don\u2019t need to know what is going on with the population and still we have the power to study it.", "Finally, it is time to craft the CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM in formal words.", "According to Investopedia, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution (also known as a \u201cbell curve\u201d), as the sample size becomes larger, assuming that all samples are identical in size, regardless of the shape of population distribution.", "When I first saw this result, I had some mixed feelings as this is a beautiful result but, does this work every time? So I am giving a link below of the simulation I have used. You should go and run the simulation under different population distributions, different sample sizes, and I am sure you will love it!", "Moving forward to the properties of the Sampling distribution:", "Population mean \ud835\udf41 = Sample means(X\u0304)", "Finally, it is time to see how and why does this discovery make our lives so much easier:", "Listing each and every use case is like counting stars in the sky. So I would rest my case!", "Congratulations on making it till the end! You did a great job. Keep learning and contributing to the community of Medium and to the realm of Data Science.
