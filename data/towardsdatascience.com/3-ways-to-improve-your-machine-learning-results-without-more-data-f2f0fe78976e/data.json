But as always, getting what you want is easier said than done.", "Most people will go with the default advice: get more data\u2026. But what if you can\u2019t?", "Perhaps the type of data you need is very expensive. Maybe it\u2019s just plain difficult to acquire. And what happens if you get the data, re-train your model, and find that your model hasn\u2019t got any better?", "You need an alternative to boost your ML model\u2019s accuracy.", "Hyperparameters in Machine Learning are user-controlled \u201csettings\u201d of your ML model. They influence how your model\u2019s parameters will be updated and learned during training. Of course, the output of your model depends on its learned parameters, and its learned parameters are constantly updated and determined during the training phase. That updating is controlled by the model\u2019s training, which is in turn influenced by the hyperparamters! Thus, if you can set the right hyperparamters, your model will learn the most optimal weights that it possibly can with a given training algorithm and data.", "Finding the best hyper-parameters is usually done manually. It\u2019s a simple task of trial and error, with some intelligent guesstimating. You\u2019ll simply try as many hyperparameter settings as you have time for, and see which one gives you the best results. You can narrow your search space just by having some rough idea of what good parameters might be. That\u2019s a matter of domain knowledge, insight into your data, and experience with ML.", "Find the best hyperparamteters you can and you might just boost your model\u2019s performance by a few percentage points!", "Scikit learn has a nice hyper-parameter search module.", "Ensembling is the ML technique of combining the predictions of multiple models at once. The idea is that the combined knowledge of these models will give a more accurate final result than the knowledge of any single one of them. It\u2019s a very intuitive technique used very commonly in Kaggle competitions.", "To build an ensemble, simply train multiple different ML models on the same data for the same task. At inference time, you will apply all of the models to your input individually. If your task is classification, you can combine the results using a simple per class voting scheme or take the prediction with the highest confidence. For regression, just average out the results. Ensembles are an extensively field-tested and real-world-proven technique to boost prediction accuracy. Give them a try!", "Scikit learn has a nice ensembling module.", "Feature engineering involves the careful selection and possible manipulation of your data\u2019s features. The purpose of this is to feed your model only the most optimal form of input. If you can consistently give your model only the parts of the data it needs to make accurate predictions, then it doesn\u2019t have to deal with any extra noise that comes from the rest of the data.", "If you apply Principal Component Analysis and find that one of your features have very low correlation with the output, then you probably don\u2019t need to be processing it. Some features are going to be intuitively not useful, such as the ID or perhaps recording date. Or maybe you only want certain features to be considered in the first place.", "To give your model the best your data has to offer, do some data exploration to find out what information and features are actually needed for predictions. Often times, you\u2019ll find that your dataset comes with some extra features that are either redundant or don\u2019t contribute to the prediction at all.", "Follow me on twitter where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!", "Your home for data science.
