While I am finishing up my marketing automation/analytics internship, the tenure marketing analyst I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with has a very strong technical background, and has taught me some things I never would have thought of.", "When I started my journey into analytics and data science, I had a very small tech stack. Not to say that knowing a million languages and tools will help, but the tools I had experience with had very little relationship to analytics and data science. Now every tech stack is different and valuable in its own way, however, I wanted to provide some perspective on different tech stacks I\u2019ve seen from colleagues of mine, as well as my own!", "Many of you will see that my tech stack is not the most advanced thing in the world. I am not an AI expert or machine learning guru, as I am still learning, and will be for quite awhile, even after college graduation. What I have learned, however, has been able to help me so far, so I hope to give some direction to anyone who is self-teaching themselves or is moving from a business discipline into analytics and data science. Let\u2019s get into it!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time data professional, I am simply relaying my experience from my summer internships and personal practice. This is not meant to tell you what exactly you need to know,rather, this is to give you some practical advice from experiences I\u2019ve had. For advanced technical information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in some advice to help you get started in analytics, keep reading!", "This is all you need to get started! You don\u2019t need to know Python right off the bat or a NoSQL database. Something I learned the hard way is that you need to know things like how to ask questions, how to look past the numbers, and how to think like a data professional before you start coding and modeling. Every great musician learns basic music theory before they learn their instrument, as do data professionals learn the trade before the tools. After I toned back my many lessons in many different tools, I brought it back to these three tools. I\u2019m going to be honest with you all as well, these are probably the three most commonly used tools in entry-level analytics. Most of the professionals who do the modeling and machine learning at my internship are at least 7\u201310 years into their careers, and that is only their specialty. All the analysts and data scientists at my internship use these three tools in some capacity. You can do all your analysis, ETL, and database management with these three tools. Now are they the fastest or most fun? Personally I like SQL, but for the most part, it isn\u2019t as exciting as Python or other advanced tools. These tools, however, are a great way to get started learning basic concepts!", "After you spend some time getting to know the different concepts that go into analytics and data science, such as mathematics, statistics, workflows, and asking the right questions, then you can start implementing tools like Power BI, and the fan favorite, Python. When I first started learning Python, a mentor of mine said, \u201cPython is an incredibly powerful tool, but can also be incredibly overwhelming. For data science, learn the basics, and then start learning the different packages one at a time. Python makes sense when you see how different elements come together to make one great language\u201d. So for me, I picked up the basics of Python, such as the syntax, loops, data types, etc. After that, I started working on Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy. These would be the three packages I recommend learning first, as they are simple to learn, but powerful to use as well as being used in a lot of the work you will do.", "\u201cPython is an incredibly powerful tool, but can also be incredibly overwhelming. For data science, learn the basics, and then start learning the different packages one at a time. Python makes sense when you see how different elements come together to make one great language\u201d", "I would like to start with a word of caution: you do not need to know every one of these tools! Excel, Tableau/Power BI, Python, and SQL are the main tools for analysts and data scientists, as well as a part of my own tech stack. I would not incorporate anything else into your stack until you have solid knowledge and experience with those tools. That being said, once you feel you have a grasp on said tools, then would be a good time to add something else depending on what you think you\u2019ll need. Are you going to be working in databases? A NoSQL tool like MongoDB would be a good tool to start learning. Data Warehousing? Snowflake is a good choice. ETL or machine learning? Spark is a popular favorite. For me personally, I will be diving into Snowflake a little more because I know I will be working with data warehousing starting out in my career. Notice that I didn\u2019t say I\u2019m learning all three new tools, just one. As you find use cases for different tools, that would be when you start picking more up. \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it\u201d, is a real thing, so don\u2019t fall into the trap of having the biggest tech stack! Companies would much rather you have three tools that you know really well rather than ten that you don\u2019t know anything about.", "As you can see, I\u2019m not a machine learning expert or database guru. I have some tools in my tool belt, but I still have so much to learn. I put this here, however, to show you that once you get started, you\u2019ll get on a roll and be adding things as you go. I didn\u2019t necessarily learn these tools just to learn them though, I learned each of them because I was either going to be in a situation where that tool was needed, or I was in a situation where that tool was the only thing I could get. Don\u2019t get bogged down in the different tools you want to learn, learn the process and craft of analytics and data science, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about!", "Hopefully this was helpful in some way! This was not meant to tell you exactly what you need to learn, rather, this was meant to give you a map where you can chart your own journey. Take it slow, learn one tool at a time, and pick up different tools as you need them. I promise that if you go slow, the process will be enjoyable and fulfilling. Slow and steady wins the race! Be sure to practice the skills on personal projects and coding challenges so you can solidify what you learn. So take a deep breath, fire up your web browser, and get to learning! There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know about this world, especially during COVID-19, and the world needs the help of analysts and data scientists to understand and make sense of the different problems facing us.
