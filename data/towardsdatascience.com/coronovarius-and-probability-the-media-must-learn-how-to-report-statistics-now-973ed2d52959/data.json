Whether it\u2019s an allergy-sufferer, or a victim of coronavirus (\u2018covid\u2019), the \u201cunderlying symptoms\u201d phrase is used to lessen fear. Being an unfortunate combination of both a hypochondriac and a statistician, whenever I see a news article like this I immediately skim to find the relevant line and think to myself \u201cphew, I\u2019m okay then\u201d. Of course this is incredibly self-centred thinking. But as long as unconditional probabilities are reported in the media, the public\u2019s (well certainly my) sense of personal danger is heightened.", "To better explain the problem I\u2019m talking about, we\u2019re going to have to look at the stats a little bit, I\u2019ll keep it as basic as possible here, later we will go into a bit more detail.", "Let\u2019s say we want to predict the probability of a die landing on the number 6 when thrown, we want to know:", "Which is read as \u201cthe probability that a die equals 6\u201d. Now say we want to predict the probability of a die landing on the number 6, given that we know (for whatever reason) that it must land on a number greater than 3. Then we want to know:", "Where the vertical line \u201c|\u201d, means \u201cgiven that\u201d.", "The difference between these two equations is that the first is unconditional \u2014 we want to know the probability of an event occurring given no other information \u2014 and the second is conditional \u2014 we want to know the probability of an event occuring and conditioned on (or \u201cgiven\u201d) some other condition or event.", "Where this really makes a difference is when we start talking about Bayes\u2019 Theorem (or Bayes\u2019 rule). Be warned: here lies maths and stats, feel free to jump ahead to \u201cTime to Change\u201d if you\u2019d rather never look at an equation again.", "Bayes\u2019 Theorem is used to calculate or update a conditional probability based on other information available. The equation is:", "In words: the probability of an event A occurring, given some event B, is equal to the probability of event B occurring given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, and divided by the probability of event B. A bit of a mouthful, so let\u2019s instead look at an example.", "We will call A the event: death by coronavirus (see where I\u2019m going with this?), and B the event: being under the age of 65. Now we have:", "P(Dying from covid given being under the age of 65) = P(Being under the age of 65 given died from covid) \u00d7 P(Dying from covid) / P(Being under the age of 65)", "And with some algebra to tidy it up:", "where we read C as dying from covid, and A being someone\u2019s age.", "So given the stats that are being thrown around in the news, let\u2019s see if we can find a more relevant risk of dying. We need to find:", "Warning: My numbers aren\u2019t going to be too exact here.", "We know from studies and reports that the current estimated mortality rate is 3.4%\u00b3, so", "According to one website\u2074, 8% of the population is over 65, which means", "Now the harder part is to work out the probability of being under 65, given death from covid. At this point, we have to turn to the raw data. The data cannot tell us the exact mortality rate, P(C|A<65), because we don\u2019t know who does and doesn\u2019t have the virus, i.e. there could be many unreported cases. (This is also a problem with P(C) but I\u2019m ignoring that for the sake of this example). However, the data can tell us exactly P(A<65|C). We will use data from a recent study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u00b9. According to this study,", "This figure is actually for P(A < 60|C), but it\u2019s good enough for us. So putting this all together we have", "So, if you\u2019re under 65 the probability of dying from COVID-19 is actually only around 0.7% by our calculations (which are in line with more accurate estimates\u00b2).", "I\u2019ve demonstrated how easy it is to obtain calculations that are actually relevant to the reader. The above example is only relevant to 92% of the population, the other 8% are equally as important. The example conditions the probability of death on age, but underlying-health may be equally as important. The probability of dying given no underlying health conditions is actually 0.9%\u00b2. Of course, ideally, we would have a big model taking into account all of age, underlying health conditions, and other relevant background information, but at that point, we\u2019re entering the realms of more advanced statistics that go beyond the scope of a short article.", "I am fed up, frustrated and scared.
