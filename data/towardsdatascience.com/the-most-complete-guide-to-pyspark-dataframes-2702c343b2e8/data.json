The scenario might also involve increasing the size of your database like in the example below.", "Such sort of operations is aplenty in Spark where you might want to apply multiple operations to a particular key. But assuming that the data for each key in the Big table is large, it will involve a lot of data movement. And sometimes so much that the application itself breaks. A small optimization then you can do when joining on such big tables(assuming the other table is small) is to broadcast the small table to each machine/node when you perform a join. You can do this easily using the broadcast keyword. This has been a lifesaver many times with Spark when everything else fails.", "If you want, you can also use SQL with data frames. Let us try to run some SQL on the cases table.", "We first register the cases dataframe to a temporary table cases_table on which we can run SQL operations. As you can see, the result of the SQL select statement is again a Spark Dataframe.", "I have shown a minimal example above, but you can use pretty much complex SQL queries involving GROUP BY, HAVING, AND ORDER BY clauses as well as aliases in the above query.", "There are many ways that you can use to create a column in a PySpark Dataframe. I will try to show the most usable of them.", "The most pysparkish way to create a new column in a PySpark DataFrame is by using built-in functions. This is the most performant programmatical way to create a new column, so this is the first place I go whenever I want to do some column manipulation.", "We can use .withcolumn along with PySpark SQL functions to create a new column. In essence, you can find String functions, Date functions, and Math functions already implemented using Spark functions. Our first function, the F.col function gives us access to the column. So if we wanted to add 100 to a column, we could use F.col as:", "We can also use math functions like F.exp function:", "There are a lot of other functions provided in this module, which are enough for most simple use cases. You can check out the functions list here.", "Sometimes we want to do complicated things to a column or multiple columns. This could be thought of as a map operation on a PySpark Dataframe to a single column or multiple columns. While Spark SQL functions do solve many use cases when it comes to column creation, I use Spark UDF whenever I need more matured Python functionality.", "To use Spark UDFs, we need to use the F.udf function to convert a regular python function to a Spark UDF. We also need to specify the return type of the function. In this example the return type is StringType()", "This might seem a little odd, but sometimes both the spark UDFs and SQL functions are not enough for a particular use-case. I have observed the RDDs being much more performant in some use-cases in real life. You might want to utilize the better partitioning that you get with spark RDDs. Or you may want to use group functions in Spark RDDs.", "Whatever the case be, I find this way of using RDD to create new columns pretty useful for people who have experience working with RDDs that is the basic building block in the Spark ecosystem. Don\u2019t worry much if you don\u2019t understand it. It is just here for completion.", "The process below makes use of the functionality to convert between Row and pythondict objects. We convert a row object to a dictionary. Work with the dictionary as we are used to and convert that dictionary back to row again. This might come in handy in a lot of situations.", "This functionality was introduced in the Spark version 2.3.1. And this allows you to use pandas functionality with Spark. I generally use it when I have to run a groupBy operation on a Spark dataframe or whenever I need to create rolling features and want to use Pandas rolling functions/window functions rather than Spark window functions which we will go through later in this post.", "The way we use it is by using the F.pandas_udf decorator. We assume here that the input to the function will be a pandas data frame. And we need to return a pandas dataframe in turn from this function.", "The only complexity here is that we have to provide a schema for the output Dataframe. We can use the original schema of a dataframe to create the outSchema.", "Here I am using Pandas UDF to get normalized confirmed cases grouped by infection_case. The main advantage here is that I get to work with pandas dataframes in Spark.", "Window functions may make a whole blog post in itself. Here I will talk about some of the most important window functions available in spark.", "For this, I will also use one more data CSV, which has dates present as that will help with understanding Window functions much better. I will use the TimeProvince dataframe which contains daily case information for each province.", "You can get rank as well as dense_rank on a group using this function. For example, you may want to have a column in your cases table that provides the rank of infection_case based on the number of infection_case in a province. We can do this by:", "Sometimes our data science models may need lag based features. For example, a model might have variables like the price last week or sales quantity the previous day. We can create such features using the lag function with window functions. Here I am trying to get the confirmed cases 7 days before. I am filtering to show the results as the first few days of corona cases were zeros. You can see here that the lag_7 day feature is shifted by 7 days.", "Sometimes it helps to provide rolling averages to our models. For example, we might want to have a rolling 7-day sales sum/mean as a feature for our sales regression model. Let us calculate the rolling mean of confirmed cases for the last 7 days here. This is what a lot of the people are already doing with this dataset to see the real trends.", "There are a few things here to understand. First is the rowsBetween(-6,0) function that we are using here. This function has a form of rowsBetween(start,end) with both start and end inclusive. Using this we only look at the past 7 days in a particular window including the current_day. Here 0 specifies the current_row and -6 specifies the seventh row previous to current_row. Remember we count starting from 0.", "If we had used rowsBetween(-7,-1) we would just have looked at past 7 days of data and not the current_day.", "One could also find a use for rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow) where we take the rows between the first row in a window and the current_row to get running totals. I am calculating cumulative_confirmed here.", "Sometimes we may need to have the dataframe in flat format. This happens frequently in movie data where we may want to show genres as columns instead of rows. We can use pivot to do this. Here I am trying to get one row for each date and getting the province names as columns.", "One thing to note here is that we need to provide an aggregation always with the pivot function even if the data has a single row for a date.", "This is just the opposite of the pivot. Given a pivoted dataframe like above, can we go back to the original?", "Yes, we can. But the way is not that straightforward. For one we will need to replace - with _ in the column names as it interferes with what we are about to do. We can simply rename the columns:", "Now we will need to create an expression which looks like the below:", "The general format is as follows:", "It may seem daunting, but we can create such an expression using our programming skills.", "And voila! we have got our dataframe in a vertical format. There are quite a few column creations, filters, and join operations needed to get exactly the same format as before, but I will not get into those.", "Sometimes it might happen that a lot of data goes to a single executor since the same key is assigned for a lot of rows in our data. Salting is another way that helps you to manage data skewness.", "So assuming we want to do the sum operation when we have skewed keys. We can start by creating the Salted Key and then doing a double aggregation on that key as the sum of a sum still equals sum. To understand this assume we need the sum of confirmed infection_cases on the cases table and assume that the key infection_cases is skewed. We can do the required operation in two steps.", "We first create a salting key using a concatenation of infection_case column and a random_number between 0 to 9. In case your key is even more skewed, you can split it in even more than 10 parts.", "This is how the table looks after the operation:", "2. First Groupby on salt key", "3. Second Group On the original Key", "Here we saw how the sum of sum can be used to get the final sum. You can also make use of facts like:", "You can think about ways in which salting as an idea could be applied to joins too.", "Spark works on the lazy execution principle. What that means is that nothing really gets executed until you use an action function like the .count() on a dataframe. And if you do a .count function, it generally helps to cache at this step. So I have made it a point to cache() my dataframes whenever I do a .count() operation.", "When you work with Spark you will frequently run with memory and storage issues. While in some cases such issues might be resolved using techniques like broadcasting, salting or cache, sometimes just interrupting the workflow and saving and reloading the whole dataframe at a crucial step has helped me a lot. This helps spark to let go of a lot of memory that gets utilized for storing intermediate shuffle data and unused caches.", "You might want to repartition your data if you feel your data has been skewed while working with all the transformations and joins. The simplest way to do it is by using:", "Sometimes you might also want to repartition by a known scheme as this scheme might be used by a certain join or aggregation operation later on. You can use multiple columns to repartition using:", "You can get the number of partitions in a data frame using:", "You can also check out the distribution of records in a partition by using the glom function. This helps in understanding the skew in the data that happens while working with various transformations.", "Sometimes you might want to read the parquet files in a system where Spark is not available. In such cases, I normally use the below code:", "This was a big post and congratulations on you reaching the end. These are the most common functionalities I end up using in my day to day job.", "Hopefully, I\u2019ve covered the Dataframe basics well enough to pique your interest and help you get started with Spark.
