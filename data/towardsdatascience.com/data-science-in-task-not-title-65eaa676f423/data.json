Fair warning: this article is more to inspire others. The advice I do end up giving works for me, and hopefully, it works for someone reading this.", "Hello World! I have news for you; I am a data scientist. Or at least I consider myself to be. The definition of a data scientist has been solidifying over the years in large part to high profile AI and ML startups who have pioneered job descriptions and team structures. I, however, do not work on one of those teams. I don\u2019t even work in one of those companies nor see one of those teams in my company. I consider myself to be a data scientist because I munge, study, model, analyze, create visuals of, and explain data to both internal and external stakeholders. It sounds like a lot when I write it out, but I\u2019m willing to bet that many of us perform the same or similar work without the data science moniker. We are data scientists in task but not title.", "I didn\u2019t make it here by any conventional path, and I seriously doubt there is one. Data science is about following one\u2019s passion for exploration and learning on a daily basis. That constant self-driven growth is what slowly takes us from where we started to where we are today, data science. Both as a field and as the people in that field, no one learned all they needed for data science from school. In fact, school just gives us a foundation. I\u2019ve worked with individuals who have backgrounds in areas like biomedical testing, computer science, operations research, statistics, and psychology. Even I started in music education. So how did I develop my own path and what did it take to get from music teacher to data scientist? Passion.", "I still remember the feel of raw maple drumshells. The waft of glue and wood was so distinct and soothing when I changed a drumhead. I also remember the twisting knots in my stomach when I couldn\u2019t keep up with the rest of the band. I wasn\u2019t a bad performer, but I wasn\u2019t great. My love and passion was in teaching. Seeing the understanding click and the joy streak across a child\u2019s face was what kept me at it for 5 years.", "I approached music, drumming, and percussion like an engineer. Perhaps that desire to slow it down and study every fragment held me back when I played, but it set me apart when I sat beside a student. I could explain grip, tension, and feel in a myriad of ways that slowly bridged those gaps in understanding that sometimes feel impassable. I was happy, truly happy when I was teaching. So what happened? Ambition.", "It wasn\u2019t enough for me to give private lessons all my life or teach at a small school somewhere. I wanted to be a big fish in a big pond. AAAND\u2026. queue the next phase in life. I floundered! I became a nobody in a sea of somebodies. I spent the next year as a valet, but I never let my passion die. On my breaks and moments of silence I continued to read a book that had been a wonderfully odd cornerstone of a research paper I wrote on brain based education, i.e. neuroscience applied to teaching.", "In a few months I found myself being accepted to a university for a Master\u2019s Degree in psychology with a focus in neuroscience. It was surreal. I thought I had somehow stolen someone else\u2019s spot (the acceptance letter read \u2018Harold\u2019), but in reality my professor chose to take me on because of my music background. His research focused on kids with dyslexia and how they process auditory information. He was looking for a musician to provide a fresh perspective to his work. I fit perfectly! I finally found a group of people who wanted to scrutinize details of behavior like engineers, the same way I had approached music before. This phase of behavior focused study would prove useful later when dealing with stakeholders but was not my ultimate catalyst into data science. That honor goes to the humble regression class. Regression ended up being my introduction to a world that, much to my surprise would consume my every thought.", "Statistics clicked with me. It made sense to me and made sense of the world. I switched to the most niche field, Quantitative Psychology, and I was once again happy, truly happy. That constant self driven growth and determination to not fall behind my peers (many of whom had statistics in their bachelors) forced me to read additional textbooks and articles just to understand my assignments. Luckily, my professors were very encouraging of ideas, questions, and criticisms. Soon I made a habit of all three. I asked lots of questions, proposed alternative theories, and tried to apply new statistical methods to well established fields. I felt at the time that many of them were stupid questions (and in hindsight many definitely were), but I knew that putting myself out there like that helped me grow. Those two years helped me find what I was good at and taught me how to teach myself.", "Upon graduating I would finally be set loose upon the world. Armed with raw passion and a small amount of refined talent, I was going to redefine the way the world looked at everything. Or so I thought until my old friend Ambition set me up to be humbled once more as an entry level analyst. I used the smallest fraction of all that I had been taught. Means, maximums, and minimums ruled the world, a series of bar charts passed for a client presentation slide deck, and IT was our data munger. It worked. The company made money, but I didn\u2019t feel like I contributed just by doing what had always been done.", "It\u2019s been a hard road since stepping into the corporate world. I won\u2019t make a long post any longer by recapping this phase of life. Fortunately, I don\u2019t have to in order to make my point. I didn\u2019t grow up wanting to be a data scientist (also it wasn\u2019t a thing when I was growing up). I didn\u2019t go to school for data science. I started with following my passions. Next I leveraged my talents, and then allowed my constant self-driven desire for growth to take over. Still I walked out into the world as prepared as anyone after school. I had a foundation.", "Over the past 5 years, I have been allowing that constant self-driven growth to define me and the quality of work that I deliver. It\u2019s that drive that allows me, as a regular analyst, to build soundex clustering algorithms to match physicians in manual entry data, redefine in-market-timing models using anomaly detection autoencoders, and implement openCV to recover information out of images of advertisements. School never taught me any of that. I taught myself how to be a data scientist, and I\u2019m willing to bet that I\u2019m not the only one who taught themselves to dream, build, and deliver like a data scientist without the title.", "So, here is my final advice for those in love with data science who feel like they are on the outside looking in.", "1. Find something you\u2019re passionate about.2. Find where your talents make the most impact.3. Grow and develop where one and two meet.", "Go out there and consume ideas from other fields or industries and apply them to yours. Take a few hours every Friday to work on or study a new idea because growth doesn\u2019t just come to you; you cultivate it. Data science doesn\u2019t just come to you either; you cultivate it every step of the way.", "Shoutout to all the analysts out there implementing big ideas. We are data scientists in task, not title.", "Your home for data science.
