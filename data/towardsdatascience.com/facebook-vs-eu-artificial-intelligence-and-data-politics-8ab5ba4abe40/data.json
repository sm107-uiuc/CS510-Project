It seems Facebook Data Policy is moving in the direction from a notion of liberal \u2018freedom\u2019 to what Nick Clegg proposes as \u2018reality-based solutions\u2019. Both which are equally vague.", "From a question of private to state power with a following confusion it would be interesting in this \u2018outro\u2019 or ending to look at an academic definition of Data Politics.", "Data Politics was defined in a report published December 2017 on Researchgate by Evelyn Ruppert , Engin Isin and Didier Bigo:", "We define \u2018data politics\u2019 as both the articulation of political questions about these worlds and the ways in which they provoke subjects to govern themselves and others by making rights claims.
