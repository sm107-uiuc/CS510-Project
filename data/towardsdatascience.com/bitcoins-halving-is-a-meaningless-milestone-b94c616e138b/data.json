There were countdowns, live-streamed video events and chants of \u201cwhen moon?\u201d It cracked the mainstream news and is regarded as the biggest event in crypto. The halving has driven seemingly every bitcoin owner on the face of the Earth into making enthused price predictions and posting them online.", "All of this is categorically insane. Worse, it is built on a lie, or at least a piece of purposeful misdirection on the part of Bitcoin\u2019s major boosters, who should know better.", "There are just as many bitcoins today (18,375,000) as there were yesterday, before the halving", "Let\u2019s recall what the halving actually does. It\u2019s very simple: it halves the block reward for bitcoin miners, from 12.5 new BTC to 6.25. This changes the economics of mining significantly, by making mining much less lucrative. Some miners might stop altogether, hurting Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate.", "And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all the halving does. It slows the rate that new BTC are produced. It does absolutely nothing to change the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply in real terms. Unfortunately, most pundits and Bitcoin boosters are promoting the opposite. Let\u2019s deconstruct this misdirection bit by bit.", "The typical narrative for the Bitcoin halving goes something like this:", "Hopefully the misdirection apparent in this narrative is clear by now. There are multiple meanings of the word \u2018supply\u2019, and too many in the Bitcoin community are implying that the absolute supply \u2014 that is, the number of bitcoins in circulation \u2014 is dropping. This is just not true. There are just as many bitcoins today (18,375,000) as there were yesterday, before the halving. Actually \u2014 there are slightly more \u2014 that number continues to increase! It is just doing so at a slower rate.", "The popular misinterpretation of \u2018supply\u2019 has huge consequences for the way the cryptocurrency community thinks about the halving. The real consequences are those I laid out above: miner economics, hash rate \u2014 comparatively technical and hardly bullish for the price of Bitcoin. This makes for an oh-so-boring narrative.", "Instead, the Bitcoin community prefers a distorted version of events where the halving, somehow, changes the cryptocurrency\u2019s fundamental supply and demand. Given that the supply of BTC does not change whatsoever, this requires a herculean level of mental gymnastics. And yet many Bitcoin \u2018influencers\u2019 are up to the dubious task of trying to justify the hype:", "Pomp, with the biggest cult following in Bitcoin community, really leads by example here by butchering the economics.", "Pomp gets the new daily supply of bitcoin (the tiny number of bitcoins mined each day) confused with the daily supply of bitcoin in absolute terms (ie, how many people wish to sell BTC on any given day). The latter definition is the only one that makes sense if you are comparing with daily demand for bitcoin (ie, how many buyers wish to buy bitcoin on any given day), but Pomp gets the two totally mixed up.", "The white trend line above tracks a very popular and entirely hypothetical \u2018Stock to Flow\u2019 model which tracks BTC\u2019s evidently inevitable rise to $1,000,000. As you can see, the key characteristic of this model is how the bitcoin price is meant to \u2018jump\u2019 every four years at the time of the halving.", "Mysteriously, the BTC price did not follow this theorist\u2019s lovingly made-up trend line in neon green, and did not crack $10,000 \u201cthis time tomorrow\u201d.", "None of this is to say that the halving has no consequences. It really does affect the bottom line of Bitcoin miners. But it\u2019s very strange to see this construed as a bullish event or a milestone for cryptocurrency \u2014 if anything, the risk of miners pulling their operations for lack of profits might be a threat to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work security. Anybody touting \u201ceconomic\u201d evidence that the halving will see the BTC price explode should be treated with great scepticism.", "The halving is nothing more and nothing less than a pre-programmed event to make mining tougher", "On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that the sheer volume and hype built up around the halving produces its own impact. All of the feverish anticipation and coverage (including in mainstream news sources, which is rare) might drive a new generation of buyers to shiny cryptocurrency wallets, seeking to be part of the Bitcoin rocket ship before its preordained take-off. These buyers will have been brought in off the back of half-baked theories and dodgy economics, but ultimately any significant increase in the demand of BTC will raise its price.", "But while such an increase would undoubtedly be put down to the mathematical magic of the halving and its non-existent supply shock, the real answer is precisely the opposite. Bitcoin\u2019s supply will have stayed the same, and it is increased demand that pushed up the price.", "This is the tragically unexciting truth for Bitcoin in general. While so many seek the safety of \u201cinevitable\u201d price increases through reduction in supply, that does not actually reflect how Bitcoin works or what Satoshi envisaged.", "The halving is nothing more and nothing less than a pre-programmed event to make mining tougher and flatten the curve of bitcoin production. If BTC does end up \u201cmooning\u201d, it will come from surging demand of the asset, not the reduction of mining profits.", "If you are interested in the impact of crypto and blockchain, you will like my new publication Technocracy. I\u2019ll be regularly writing about how technology is changing society, like my most recent piece about how the Coronavirus is making mass surveillance our new normal.", "Your home for data science.
