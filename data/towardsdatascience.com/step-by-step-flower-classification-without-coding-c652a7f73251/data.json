But if you go to the doctor, to the lawyer\u2019s or to the farmer\u2019s, no intelligent machine is significantly helping their core activities yet. Without making a judgment, this seems a little weird.", "Little access to new technology and shortage of experts are issues that are far from being solved. However, there are plenty of data analytics use cases for traditional professional categories, academic researchers and subject matter experts.", "The good news is that part of the state-of-the-art technologies used to elaborate AI applications today are publicly available. The rise of open source libraries and deep learning frameworks have made the spread of such technologies possible. With transfer learning we can train performing deep learning models with fewer images or text data than ever before. This means that doctors could use on their X-ray images the same models used in self-driving cars. If you\u2019re interested, you may have a look at how Fast.ai and Hugging Face work.", "However, the access to these frameworks is still limited to people with coding skills. Thus, the unbalance between the maturity of the technology and its accessibility by potential users generated an increasing vibe for no-code AI.", "Of course, by definition, being no-code makes it less complicated. As it is less complex than coding AI applications, it doesn\u2019t have the same reach and power.", "In no way can a no-code platform perfectly replace a well assembled team of data specialists today, or tomorrow.", "The major limit of no-code AI is its strictness. The no-code programs are not tailored to customers\u2019 needs and may not support the workload required for a specific problem. Another limit is the difficulty to use business knowledge to improve performance or impose constraints.", "Beside its limits, the attention towards no-code solutions has definitely been rising in the past years. You can find a detailed review of established providers here.", "In this article, we will try out Giotto on a flower classification project. Giotto is a no-code, cloud based platform that allows users to develop, deploy and share AI applications built on their own data problems quite easily. It is organised in five steps (from data selection to deployment) and the user is given the possibility to choose some of the parameters or to automate the entire process. To date, it supports image classification problems, but additional data types and tasks are said to be coming soon.", "No-code AI does not mean magic AI : providing good data is still a priority, otherwise the model performance would easily degrade.", "In this example, we performed a classification task for 102 species of plants using images of their flowers. The goal of the classification is to be able to correctly assess a plant\u2019s species by uploading a picture of its flowers in the program.", "The dataset consists of 5400 images of flowers, with approximately 50 images per class, for a total of 102 classes. Given an image, the problem is to correctly classify its class, i.e. the flower species. The data is organised in subfolders, with each subfolder contains images of a separate/different class. To be able to use Giotto, it is crucial that such a folder structure is respected (picture above). The data is available over here.", "After the login and project creation, we are prompted to select the data type and task. For our application, we selected images and image classification.", "Just after importing the data, we can have a quick look at it in the visualisation step.", "Deep learning models work nicely, but they are known to be data hungry. Even if we make a big step towards solving the issue with transfer learning, a model will usually perform better with a larger quantity of task-specific images. One trick used in data science is to perform modifications on the original images to artificially increase the size of the data set. With Giotto, the available modifications include cropping, zooming, brightness, rotation and more.", "Without trying to be a Captain Obvious, a brighter daisy is still a daisy. As long as we try to differentiate daisies from other flowers, feeding the model with the original daisy AND a brighter daisy should be increasing the number of daisy examples the model can learn from. Thus, this should also improve its performance in most cases.", "Moreover, in some cases data augmentation may also benefit the model by removing systematic noise from the data. Imagine if you train the machine with a dataset where all the daisies face right and all the sunflowers face left. Once the machine has learned, if you give it an image of a sunflower facing to the right, it may tell you it is a daisy. The rotation (flip) tool avoids this, giving the machine flowers facing both sides.", "Even if it is very tempting to choose all the transformations for your data, it is not always the best idea. For example, if you\u2019re classifying something for which colours are important, working on the brightness may lead to a lower performance.", "In our case, we selected all of the available data augmentations, as none of them were detrimental to the model\u2019s execution.", "In the next visualisation step, you can have a look at a sample of the modified images (picture above). In case a transformation looks bad, you can always come back and remove it.", "In Model Selection, there are two main choices to make: the model type and the hyperparameters. Currently, Giotto respectively supports different resNet sizes and a range for the number of epochs.", "The resNet size is basically the number of layers your network will have. For example, a resNet 34 would stand for 34 layers of neurons. In general, \u201cthe deeper, the better\u201d applies for the model choice, provided that you feed the model with enough data. However, a larger network may also lead to larger running time and costs.", "The number of epochs is the number of times the entire data set will go through the neural network. Or, in other words, the number of times the network will \u201csee\u201d the data. Giotto comes with a cool early stopping rule: if the performance doesn\u2019t improve from one epoch to the next, the training is stopped.", "Finally, you can select the metric that best fits your problem requirements. Among the possible choices we have Accuracy, AUC, F1-score and more.", "As for all the steps, if you have no idea of what parameters to choose, you can just automate the selection and go to the results.", "In our case we selected a resNet34 with 10 epochs.", "Once the model has finished running, you can visualize its performance. It\u2019s important to take some time to meticulously check all the details here.", "There will first be a summary of the task which basically describes the data used. Then comes the model summary, which recapitulates the parameters of the model that were previously chosen. Finally, we have the actual performance of the training such as the accuracy, the hardest images to classify and the confusion matrix. It\u2019s also possible to download summary of this page in PDF format.", "In our case, It took only 7 minutes for the machine to train with our settings. Results were satisfactory, with a 95% accuracy measured on a validation set of 1180 images.", "Now that the model is trained, you have two choices. You can download it as a Docker image and use it offline, or you can deploy it in a user-friendly web app that you can easily share with other users. Once deployed (web app or Docker), the model can be used to classify unseen images.", "In our case, we deployed the model on a web app that you can access here (password: Loveflowers8).", "We have shown that\u2019s it\u2019s possible to achieve satisfactory results on an image classification task in a few minutes, without writing a single line of code. The result is a web app that can be used on new pictures and shared with other users.", "No-code AI will probably never replace data scientists. However, it remains a dependable and user-friendly alternative for people who lack access to state-of-the-art technologies in AI.", "Your home for data science.
