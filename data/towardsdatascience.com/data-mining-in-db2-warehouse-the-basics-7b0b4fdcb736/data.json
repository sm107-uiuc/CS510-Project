As with other in-database initiatives, the idea is to bring and concentrate the modeling and inference efforts as close as possible to where the core business data resides. Besides the benefits this co-location provides in terms of performance and scalability, the use of SQL to train, validate and score data mining models enables an easy integration of these artifacts with the corporate transactional and analytical processes. You can learn more about in-database data mining features and benefits in my previous story.", "The objective of this paper is to position IBM Db2 Warehouse as a reference database platform to develop and deploy data mining workloads. It covers the main features of the data warehouse engine, with special focus in the analytical routines available, an overview of the model management framework and the extensions points in order to leverage Spark, Python or R in the same common platform. It should serve as a starting point for future stories around specific modeling functions and scenarios.", "Db2 Warehouse [1] is an analytics data warehouse platform developed by IBM. Built upon IBM\u2019s Common SQL Engine, Db2 Warehouse is available on cloud (IBM Cloud and Amazon Web Services) as a managed service, or as Docker image for custom deployment and easy scale out (Figure 1). Key features include:", "The development and deployment of data mining applications in the database is one of the most significant features of Db2 Warehouse.", "Training a machine learning algorithm means extensive database interactions because data has to be repetitively fetched in each training epoch. This process involves multiple SQL statements, which in turn can create many send and receive network operations (and the associated CPU cost) if training is done in an external application. However, if training is implemented as a routine executed in the database, all these SQL statements, including those writing to result tables, are encapsulated into a single send and receive operation: network traffic is minimized, more data can be processed and training performance is improved. This is one of the main benefits of in-database data mining approaches.", "Db2 Warehouse provides more than 125 built-in analytical routines [2], covering the different steps of a data mining solution workflow: data exploration and understanding, transformation, modeling, validation and scoring. Most of these routines are in the form of stored procedures and user-defined functions. In the first case, invocation is made through a CALL statement to the stored procedure, and in the second as a part of a SQL SELECT.", "These routines are part of each database catalog in the form of a SQL PL module, SYSIBMADM.IDAX, that also contains supporting data types and variables. They can be classified in six main categories.", "The goal of data exploration is to understand the data that will be modeled by analyzing different statistics and identifying distributions, but also to detect possible quality problems that can be resolved by data transformation functions before the modeling tasks.", "With confirmatory data analysis you can test hypothesis and examine data from several groups, verifying independence, correlation and significance.", "The data transformation category contains routines to convert the data structures to be analyzed in order to make them more suitable for further analytical processing. They can be easily chained with exploratory and modeling routines in order to conform training pipelines that can be also scheduled.", "These machine learning methods detect patterns and co-occurrence relationships in datasets without pre-defined categories and minimum user supervision.", "Supervised learning methods comprise classification and regression functions, depending if the target variable is categorical or numerical. All of them implement modeling and scoring modes.", "Diagnostic functions provide methods to assess the accuracy and quality of classification and regression models during the validation phase.", "Figure 2 represents a typical classification model pipeline, covering data exploration, data preparation, training and validation steps. Listing 1 details each step of the pipeline in terms of the analytical routine (stored procedure) used, its functionality and the arguments required.", "The input dataset to the pipeline contains the results of the chemical analysis of 13 constituents present in several wines belonging to three different cultivars. The goal is to identify the correct cultivar based on those constituents.", "The idea is that the invocation of this procedures can be chained and packed inside another routine or compound statement that can be invoked as a whole, adding additional logic, error handling, auditing or execution permissions. Also, it is possible to leverage the integrated Db2 scheduler to define and automate tasks that execute pipelines like this one.", "Machine learning algorithms generate data mining models that are stored in the database. A set of administrative routines are providing in order to manage them, including security and permissions. The model catalog is located in the SYSTOOLS schema and it is comprised of four tables that store different model metadata (Figure 3):", "Besides requiring specific privileges, model catalog tables should not be accessed directly. For this reason, several routines for metadata management are providing in different categories:", "In short, Db2 Warehouse provides a complete SQL API for metadata management. As with the rest of analytical routines, you can interact with these functions though SQL scripts or external applications that support stored procedures calls. Additionally, most of these functions are available in the Db2 Warehouse web console interface.", "Besides running in-database data mining functions from within SQL, there are additional options in order to expand the analytical capabilities of the Db2 Warehouse database environment.", "Database functionality can be expanded by distinct types of routines. In any case, a routine implements in-database logic, meaning applications are executed in the same process than the database, with minimum network operations and reduced processor costs. The result is an important improvement in the performance of data-intensive processes and SQL execution. As described before, Db2 Warehouse already provides a full set of built-in analytical procedures. However, it is possible to expand the analytical capabilities by writing user-defined extensions. Several options are available:", "In addition to other database objects, user-defined routines can be obfuscated in Db2 Warehouse, so they can be deployed to the database without exposing the application logic. This is important for solution providers and developers that want to protect their intellectual property.", "Db2 Warehouse includes an Apache Spark cluster that is highly integrated with the database engine. In this way, it is possible to deploy, launch and monitor Spark applications that directly read data from the database, process this data in parallel in the cluster, and then write the results back to the database. There are four possible methods to manage jobs in the integrated Spark cluster:", "Since Spark executors are co-located with the database nodes, the access latency to the data is minimized (Figure 4). Data is transferred using shared memory through inter-process communication, so there is a significant speed gain specially when processing big datasets.", "Db2 Warehouse provides several components and extensions for accessing databases from Python applications:", "Similar to Python, R programming in Db2 Warehouse is based on several packages:", "Db2 Warehouse is a high-scalable platform where data and analytics are co-located on the same place. By leveraging the relational database engine and the SQL language, data mining workloads can be deployed where the data already resides, avoiding extractions to specialized external systems.", "Equipped with more than a hundred of analytical routines, covering data exploration, transformation and machine learning algorithms, Db2 Warehouse also provides extension capabilities with an integrated Spark cluster and specialized Python and R libraries.
