Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is all over the media, and everyone wants to be involved in the technology race. Progress during the last few years has been absolutely tremendous, and you have probably heard claims such as \u201cAI is the new electricity\u201d and \u201cAI will completely revolutionize our society\u201d. I will not comment on those statements, but what we can all safely agree on, is that there is definitively a lot of interest concerning these technologies. However, all this attention begs the important question: can it really live up to the hype?", "Within certain areas, the technology has caught up to, and even surpassed the hype. For example, within image recognition, the task of identifying objects and extracting information from images, AI is now going beyond human level performance (i.e., machines are actually getting better than humans in identifying objects and images).", "When applied correctly on the right use-cases, AI solutions can offer great value to your business. However, with all the attention and hype around AI and ML, it becomes very important to be clear about how and when these technologies should be used.", "Referring to the \u201cGartner hype cycle for emerging technologies\u201d in the above figure, we see that \u201cAI /Deep Learning\u201d are located all the way at the top of the hype cycle. The pros about this, is that there is a lot of attention concerning the possibilities these technologies offer. But, at the same time, one needs to be aware that there in some cases can be a mismatch between expectations and reality. This makes it ever more important to go beyond the hype and show how AI/ML and data analytics can be applied correctly in order to solve business relevant cases and provide real value.", "Why do we suddenly have this hype around AI? AI and ML have been around for a long time, but there are some key factors that explain why these technologies have really started to kick off during the last couple of years.", "One crucial factor is of course the amount of available data. Access to huge amounts of data is one of the key ingredients that makes ML so powerful. The amount of available data has been growing in an exponential pace, both in terms of the number of devices recording data and also the connectivity between them through the internet of things (IOT).", "Of course, having access to vast amount of data is one thing. Another is being able to process these data in order to extract useful information. The access to cheap and powerful computing resources has been vital to drive progress within AI and ML. As a visual example of the tremendous development in computing power, let us have a look at the figure above. On the left, we have an image of (parts of) the NEC earth simulator, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer about 15 years ago. Whereas today, you can buy an ordinary gaming computer and essentially have access to the same amount of computing power.", "The complementing factors of access to Big Data and massive computing power has made it possible to process data on a scale that was not feasible just a few years ago. With the added benefit of open access to much of the research by tech giants such as Google and Facebook, we now have a very good starting point to solve new and interesting problems.", "Going beyond the hype and actually build solutions that provide real value to your business, there are several important ingredients to consider. The technical aspects concering algorithms, computers and data is one thing, but in order to build good solutions you need cross-functional collaborations.", "Domain knowledge: On the one hand, you need someone with domain knowledge about the problem you are trying to solve. What are the possibilities and limitations within a system, and how can the solution be applied in practice?", "Data Science: You also need the capabilities within Data Science, which involves everything related to analytics, statistics, signal processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning. Essentially, methods and techniques to extract and utilize patterns and information in your data", "Software engineering: Software engineering skills are crucial for building good data driven solutions. This involves setting up infrastructure for harvesting and processing data through proper pipelines and managing access to data, and in the end building functional and user-friendly software tools for the end users.", "The essential thing is that you need to successfully combine all these ingredients in order to build good products.", "Machine learning is one of the major subfields of AI, and one where there is currently a lot of progress in developing new and better solutions. Without going into the technical details, ML is essentially all about extracting valuable information from data. Data, in this context, could be anything from text, video, images, sound, sensor data, etc. Typical ML solutions could range from models that analyze and classify images and video, monitors the \u201chealth state\u201d of complex industrial equipment through sensor data or predicts the future sales forecast for your business. (We will get back to some concrete use-case examples towards the end of the article)", "It is important to keep in mind that deep learning is not magic, but based on mathematical models that process information in e.g. images (after all, images are just a collection of numbers as seen by computers).", "The term \u201cartificial neural network\u201d comes from the association with how information is processed in the brain. ANN models do not try to replicate the human brain, but they are loosely inspired by mathematical models of \u201cneurons\u201d, one of the building blocks of neural information processing (hence the name neural network).", "The layered structure of these artificial neural networks (illustrated in the above figure) is why we refer to this type of modeling as \u201cDeep Learning\u201d. The deeper layers of the model (left part of the figure) typically extract information about sharp edges and basic shapes, whereas the upper layers (right part of the figure) detect finer and more detailed structures.", "Learning these models how to correctly classify images is a time consuming and computationally demanding process. We essentially present the model with examples of correctly classified images, and the model then tries to classify new images by itself. Initially, the predictions are just random guessing, but by showing the model a high enough number of images, and correcting it every time it makes a wrong guess, it eventually learns to extract the relevant information in order to classify them correctly.", "What is amazing, is that we do not have to tell the model what to look for \u2014 it learns these features by itself through experience (the reason we refer to this as \u201cmachine learning\u201d).", "Progress in this field has been astonishing in recent years, mainly due to access to vast amounts of data and cheap computing power. Performance for many tasks is now beyond human level (i.e., machines are actually getting better than humans in identifying and classifying objects and images). This, of course, has many very interesting and useful applications we will get back to shortly.", "We often think of \u201cintelligence\u201d as the ability to perform tasks we typically associate with human intelligence. One such task could e.g. be the creative ability to generate art or music. Interestingly enough, even for these types of creative \u201chuman\u201d tasks we are now seeing AI that perform surprisingly well.", "As an illustration of this, I show an example above where an AI model was trained to generate images in the style of the famous Norwegian painter Edward Munch. Given a trained model, we can then use pictures of new scenery as \u201cinspiration\u201d for the \u201cAI-artist\u201dand replicate that in the painting style of the human artist. Works surprisingly well, don`t you think?", "The above example is perhaps not very useful (although entertaining). However, it nicely illustrates the ability of the underlying technology to extract meaningful information from images, which in turn can be very useful for other applications.", "To show the large span in topics we work on, I have picked a few examples of how ML can be used in real-world scenarios. These examples range from using data analysis and ML for condition monitoring of heavy-duty industrial equipment to computer vision for quality assurance and various image recognition and object detection tasks. You can also read about some of our other exciting projects here.", "The above case is for a typical production company, which could e.g. involve the fabrication of complex equipment or controlling a process plant. In general, anything where the end product is some kind of produced unit.", "The simplified view illustrated in the above figure is to make use of all available information through sensor data and uncover relationships between measured variables and production quality. Does variable \u00abx\u00bb affect the production quality? Given current operating conditions, what is the risk that my product will be defect? Which part of the production is critical to optimize in order to improve product quality? These are some of the questions we might answer through proper utilization of available data.", "As a concrete example, we can e.g. consider the use of sensor data for condition monitoring of a compressor. In this case, we monitor sensor data (temperatures, pressures, vibration, ++) and the ML model learns what is \u201cnormal\u201d based on accumulated experience. The model continuously look for anomalies in the recorded data and signs of upcoming failures/breakdowns. If behavior looks suspicious based on measured variables, the model can generate alarms or initiate preventive measures.", "Early warning of upcoming failures is of great value for condition-based maintenance and planning of repairs etc. Making use of such solutions can help avoid sudden breakdowns due to early warnings that allows for preventive measures and controlled shutdown of critical equipment. If you are interested in learning more about how ML can be used for condition monitoring, you can have a read in the following article", "The above picture showcases an example where this technology has been applied within quality assurance. In this case, the model analyze images looking for certain defined characteristics such as corrosion, damages, cracks, bad welds etc. Perhaps not as entertaining as generating art, but definitively very useful for many industrial applications.", "Another example is the application of object detection for monitoring of fish health in fish farms. This is a task which is very challenging today, since the fish is mainly unaccessible for direct visual inspection under water. A new innovative solution is to make use of underwater cameras and AI solutions for automatic image and video analysis. This allows for extracting, in real-time, important information on fish health and wellbeing. This is great news, both in terms of animal welfare and the fact that healthy fish are more profitable for the fish farm owners.

Emerging technologies can definitively be an enabler to achieve this, but focusing on the business side is crucial to succeed with new initiatives and projects.", "To build good products and innovative solutions, collaboration between different areas of expertise is key. The best solutions emerge when domain experts and software/analytics expertise collaborate to bring out the best of what emerging technologies can offer.", "If you are curious about how to get beyond the hype to real-life applications, feel free to reach out for a chat about how technology and software solutions can help solve your business needs.", "Did you find the article interesting?
