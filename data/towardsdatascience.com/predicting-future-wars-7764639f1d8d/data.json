And you are right, they spring from an intricate array of political, economic, and historical reasons without forgetting the thick coat of randomness, thus they should be dealt with caution. Even political experts keep bickering about what led to conflicts, sometimes decades after the event. Conflicts may be Black swans, inherently unpredictable game-changing events (even though experts often claim to have found obvious warning signs in hindsight). But it doesn\u2019t mean we cannot assess the atmosphere leading up to war by using machine learning.", "Using economic indicators to forecast conflicts is not a new idea, a lot of research has been done on this question \u00b9 \u00b2. The results are promising, but they use data at a given year to predict the state of a country during the same year, which is a bit counter-intuitive. If you already know the economic state of the country, then why do you need to \u201cpredict\u201d if it is at war? The information is already available. This forces them to use projections provided by organizations such as the UN to apply their models on. It makes their predictions reliant on them. Here, only past and present data are used to predict the state of a country in the near future.", "To link the indicators to the conflicts, the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset\u00b3, which lists all armed conflicts from 1946 to 2018 is used. Conflicts are broken down into different types depending on their degree of lethality and what kind of groups are opposed. For the features, economic and social indicators, in the form of yearly time series, mainly from the world bank are used. The target features are obtained by adding variables that indicate if a country is going to be in a conflict in the span of the next five years. Here, we skip the phase of preprocessing, for a more detailed description, see the report. The final dataset consists of 12 900 rows (60 years * 215 countries).", "With a multivariate time series, the Pearson\u2019s correlation is not suitable, the current conflict state can be a function of past values of other variables. That is why the Granger Causality test is applied. It determines how a time series influences another. An aggregated version by year is used to compute the test.", "The minor conflicts are strongly affected by the debt, the account balance, and the rents from natural resources. The conflicts, in general, are strongly influenced by the infant mortality rate which is an indicator that poverty triggers conflicts. The interstate conflicts are triggered by the GDP and the Account balance. There is also a strong link between foreign direct investments and the onset or emergence of new conflicts. These observations suggest that the economy has an impact, but different aspects of the economy link to different kinds of conflicts.", "The best results were not obtained with models specific to time series (VAR models) but by treating every year for every country as a data point. A random forest with 100 trees and a maximum depth of 15 achieved the results shown below.", "The features used to discriminate are shown below.", "The most influential features for the model are the Corruption, the infant mortality rate, and the Natural resources rents. This means that the model\u2019s predictions are based on regime type (corruption), poverty (Infant mortality), and dependence on resources (Natural resources).", "Finally, the fun part, data from the latest years (2018 and 2019) is fed to the model to see what country in the world will enter in a new conflict in the next five years (2019\u20132024). The results are shown in the map below.", "Many of the countries that are given a higher probability of facing a new conflict have already experienced turmoil. However, some countries like Pakistan and Indonesia, which are relatively stable, have a high probability of having a new conflict in the near future. Iran, which has recently been under immense stress from sanctions and the recent political atmosphere, has also high probability of entering a new conflict compared to others.", "If only the major conflicts are considered i.e. the wars, we get these predictions.", "In this case, only Syria and Somalia, both already in a very unstable state, get a high chance of facing a new war in the years to come.", "Even though wars are far from a deterministic system, machine learning is a useful tool to evaluate critical periods in a nation\u2019s history.", "The full project can be accessed here.", "Your home for data science.
