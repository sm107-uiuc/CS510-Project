My partner in crime for this project has been Andrew Sproul, who just like me has lots of passion for Data Science, ML / AI and the Fantasy EPL.", "This week we\u2019re going to keep it short and sweet since we\u2019ve already described our approach and major updates in the previous Blogs above.", "Top 100 players in the world did really well last weekend compared to the overall average score of 48! Still there were a few top100 players with scores in the 50\u201360 range, so if you scored near or above that you can still feel pretty good about yourself.", "Also, it is interesting to notice that the majority of the Top100 players fall into the 800\u2013820 range of total points for the season so far. It\u2019s only the Top 10 players that fall above the 820 total points mark, with the Top 2 players ahead of the pack with > 850+ pts.", "While we\u2019re on the topic of the Top 100 players in the world let\u2019s look at who the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations for GW11.", "Two interesting new names here are Martial and Pulisic, with also Maddison being picked up by lots more Top100 players and moving to #4 preferred pick.", "It\u2019s pretty obvious now that people are finally getting over the Pukki hype and he has dropped to #5 choice also his price dropping to 6.7M now (is Pukki the Bitcoin of the Fantasy EPL \u2014 all short term hype no long term value? \u2014 only time will tell\u2026). Another interesting change from last week is that Jimenez jumped to #3 quite aggressively, most likely dictated by his form and Wolves\u2019 perceived easy program.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "Still 3\u20134\u20133 is the top formation chosen, aiming to optimize the total points gained from their attacking players, who typically have a higher chance of getting assists, goals, and bonus points overall.", "Sadly our prayers to squeeze some last minute value from Yarmolenko and Cresswell didn\u2019t work, and we had to get rid of these \u201cloosing assets\u201d. Unfortunately, our bold investment in West Ham players from 3\u20134 weeks ago didn\u2019t pay off, so that has been hurting our overall ROI badly. Still we had a decent week with 54pts (above AVG of 48) and would have gotten a lot more from Traore and Saiss if Villa didn\u2019t get that 95th minute goal vs Wolves\u2026:( The good news is we picked a decent captain for a 3rd week in a row \u2014 Tammy Abraham with 8x2 = 16pts. Didn\u2019t leave that many points on the bench either, so overall we maximized our Expected ROI this week, which feels good for a change :)", "Let\u2019s start with the Adjusted Opponent Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Brighton, Palace, Everton and West Ham are the only teams with above 75th % FDR scores, with Villa and Newcastle right at the cutoff. The way our algorithm is written, it will not be recommending buying players from these teams this week. Teams with relatively easy schedules (if there can be such a thing in the EPL :P) are Arsenal, Southampton, Leicester, Norwich and Liverpool , so picking up new players from these teams could pay off over the next three 2\u20133 games.", "The data below comes from an independent site that updates latest injuries much more frequently than the Fantasy Website:", "Let\u2019s look at the top players by ROI and by the pts_per_90min Stats Next:", "Interesting to see Ramsdale, Schmeichel and Foster moving closer to the top.", "Interestingly we don\u2019t see any of the big name midfielders here due to their prices being DOUBLE the average of the midfielders listed above, who have been performing quite well, given their low prices, making their total ROI much better than the likes of Salah and Sterling etc.", "When it comes to just looking at points per 90mins of play time, without taking price into consideration, we can see some of the top scoring midfielders on the list, showing that they are still great assets, whose value has already been priced in by the market, and thus yielding a much lower ROI than some of the undervalued and over-performing midfielders from the ROI chart.", "Reminder that our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 75th %) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as currently optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "Looks like a pretty balanced team to us, with a whole 2.4M in the bank to experiment with and try different configurations of players.", "As far as our own team is concerned, we finally got rid of Cresswell and Yarmolenko and got Soyuncu and Tielemans in their place. We wish we had money for TAA, but we didn\u2019t want to spend too many points on subs, so we will try to get him or Robo somehow over the next few weeks.", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example, if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 25% of the total possible game time. For example, total possible minutes = num_weeks * 90 mins = 12* 90 = 1080. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 1080/4 = 270 minutes as active on that team.", "Things changed at the top after Liverpool\u2019s win over City, and City using a few new players in rotation due to injuries, bringing City\u2019s overall team ROI down to 4th place and pushing Liverpool to #2. We can also see Chelsea, Wolves and Man Utd getting closer to the Top 5 after a few consistent performances over the last 2\u20133 games.", "The bottom looks similar to last few weeks, with Arsenal and Spurs still struggling increase their overall team ROI and avg_pts_per_player.", "This week we will be modest and only want to ask the Fantasy Gods for at least a hattrick and an assist from our captain \u2014 Auba :) He has been an OK return on investment so far, but with the high price of 11M, we need to see some more goals from him soon to improve his total ROI and justify keeping him on our team in the long run.", "As always \u2014 thank you for reading and good luck this weekend!", "Your home for data science.
