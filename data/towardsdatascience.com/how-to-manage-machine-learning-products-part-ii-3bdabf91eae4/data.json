Developing ML products involves more experiments and iterations. Therefore, as a PM, you need to give engineers and scientists enough space and flexibility to explore before deciding on the path going forward. But how do you help your team navigate these uncertainties? How do you go about defining the business problems and metrics while allowing your team to explore?", "ML is a tool, a means to an end. Don\u2019t build an ML product if the problem you are solving doesn\u2019t require ML. Start with identifying the problem, the customer pain point that is in great demand (business potential) and solvable (technical feasibility). You can do a market sizing exercise to estimate the business potential. Then the next question is: how do we know if ML can help address our user problems. There are numerous ML applications but, to the core, ML is best suited for making decisions or predictions. We can categorize ML applications into a few types.", "You should avoid using machine learning in products if:", "Once you find the right problem to solve, the next critical task is to clearly define the requirements. Developing ML products is a highly iterative process. It might be tempting to skip proper planning and dive right into seeing what models can do. However, if you do so, you will likely end up wasting lots of time with no concrete results.", "For ML products, humans don\u2019t program the rules; machines do. It is more experimental and has to be treated differently than the conventional divide-and-conquer software engineering approach. Often times it\u2019s hard to predict what will work and what won\u2019t work. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to give engineers and scientists more room and time to explore before deciding on the path going forward.", "As a product manager, you can help your team stay focused during such an extensive exploration process by:", "(1) Define an objective function: what\u2019s the desired outcome that your model is trying to predict? Or are you trying to identify patterns in data? Are there any \u201cground truth\u201d that you can compare the outcomes of your models to? For example, if you design a model to predict the weather, you can validate the performance of your model by comparing the forecast to actual weather data.", "(2) Define performance metrics: How do you measure the success or failure of your products? It\u2019s not always straightforward to set acceptance criteria. For example, how do you measure the performance of a translation model against a human translator? Sometimes, you will need to see the initial results of the models and then decide on the criteria. But it\u2019s important to take test criteria into consideration early on and constantly test the model until you find the right model that delivers satisfactory results.", "(3) Test the models early and frequently from end to end: You can think of ML models as black boxes. You define inputs and outputs that you want your model to generate without necessarily understanding what\u2019s going on in the black box. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to build end-to-end prototypes and test the models early and frequently whenever possible. Start with simple prototypes that can help you test key functionality and then iterate on it. Avoid starting with a comprehensive end-to-end solution at all costs.", "One important thing to note is that model accuracy by itself is usually not a good measure. Instead, consider measuring precision (true positives/all positive predictions) and recall (positive predictions/all true positives). As Wikipedia explains it: Precision is about how many selected items are relevant and Recall is about how many relevant items are selected. There\u2019s no rule of thumb that would apply to all situations. You need to decide on the tradeoffs based on your business cases.", "Training ML models often requires lots of high-quality data. Deep Learning outperforms older algorithms when it\u2019s trained with a large amount of data. Hence, it\u2019s extremely important to outline your data acquisition strategy from day one. You can buy data, partner with other companies, gather data from your customers, generate data internally, or hire a third party to generate or label data for you. You need to consider what your competitors do, what your customers and regulators think, as well as corresponding feasibility and cost for each of the strategies. It\u2019s not the responsibility of data scientists to figure out your data strategy. It\u2019s a strategic business decision that product managers, executives, and key stakeholders need to define.", "If you are a startup, think twice about the sector you want to enter. Are there industry giants dominating most of the data? For example, you probably don\u2019t want to compete with Amazon on purchase history or Google Maps on location data. Try to find some niche market that no one company dominates the market yet.", "Are you able to build a defensible and sustainable data pipeline? How about compliance with your users\u2019 privacy policies? Familiarize yourself with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) if your company operates within the EU and other data protection regulations. For example, under GDPR, companies need to make sure that personal data is not only legally gathered but also protected from misuse or exploitation. Therefore, as a PM, you need to take data protection safeguards into consideration from the early stage of product development.", "Make sure that you discuss with your ML team to figure out what and how much data you would need. Involve other stakeholders like legal and operation, too. Developing ML products for the physical world such as robotics and self-driving cars poses even more challenges. Make sure that you leverage simulation and pay attention to research areas including sim to real, data augmentation, transfer-learning, and meta-learning for ways to bring down your needs for massive data and accelerate your training process.", "In most cases, you are actually building more than an ML product. To make it a complete and production-ready product, you need a user interface, software to execute model predictions, and/or hardware components. You won\u2019t have a successful product if you focus too much on building the ML model and overlook user experiences, for instance. You need a multifunctional team including not only ML engineers and scientists but also data engineers, software engineers, UX UI specialists, and/or hardware engineers. You also need to work with backend engineers to ensure that the infrastructure is there to support the ML team.", "Try to minimize the interdependencies and clashes between different functions or teams. As previously mentioned, the nature of ML makes it radically different from conventional software programming. For example, while daily stand-up meetings might be useful to keep the software engineering team productive, it might not be the best practice for the ML team. That\u2019s why ML likely requires not only technical but also organizational changes. As a PM, you can help other teams understand why and how building ML products is different and help address potential conflicts. You should also try to communicate uncertainties inherent to ML to other stakeholders in your organizations.", "Communication is critical not only with internal teams but also with customers. The performance of ML products improves over time. It\u2019s likely that customers will not get the perfect results in the beginning. Is this acceptable for your users? How to mitigate the risks for your users and guarantee an acceptable baseline performance? How to design your product to optimize user experiences?", "If you want to make the case for investing in ML features, consider the following:", "Sometimes best practices for managing software products don\u2019t necessarily apply to ML products. Here are a few things I usually remind myself of:", "Bastiane Huang is a Product Manager at OSARO, a San Francisco based startup building software-defined robotics.
