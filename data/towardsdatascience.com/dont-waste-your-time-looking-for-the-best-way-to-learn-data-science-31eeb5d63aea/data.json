Businesses want to be on the data science train to keep up with the ever-evolving technology and improve their operations. Thus, there is a huge pool of jobs in the field of data science. More and more people want to get on the train and start working in this field because:", "It is like a chain reaction. Businesses adapting data science create jobs that drive people to work in this field. These people need to be educated which motivates some other people to create learning resources. In this post, we will focus on the \u201clearning resources\u201d part of the story.", "The amount of resources to learn data science is overwhelming. There are two main reasons that cause this situation:", "There is so much to learn on so many different platforms. This can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how we handle it.", "When I started learning data science, I had some questions that were demotivating me. I would like to list some of those questions here:", "And there are some more questions. You might have similar questions and hesitate to start. I don\u2019t have answers to those questions. But my suggestion is to stop wasting your time looking for answers.", "Once you start and take the first steps, you will discover some of the answers. You will also see that there is not a clear answer to some questions. However, this should not stop your learning process.", "Another very important thing to keep in mind is that you cannot just learn everything. For instance, NLP is an entire field by itself and requires in-depth training and practice. If you want to specialize in NLP, you may focus more on NLP-specific tools and frameworks.", "There is always more than one option!", "When you start leaning towards a specific subfield of data science, some tools and frameworks become prominent but we usually have more than one option. For instance, R might be a better fit for statistical analysis than Python. However, Python also has powerful third-party statistical packages such as statsmodels. I\u2019m not trying to cause any more contradictions. I just want to point out that there are many options to learn data science.", "I also want to mention different types of resources. It is actually good to have an overwhelming amount of resources. We have the freedom to choose from different options. There are videos on youtube about almost any topic related to data science. ArXiv contains a gigantic collection of scholarly articles on data science. Numerous platforms offer data science certificates such as Coursera, Udemy, and edX. And, of course, blogs are extremely efficient to learn specific topics. For instance, we can find an article on almost any topic on Medium.", "I started by completing a certificate, IBM Data Science Specialization. It was very helpful in the sense that the topics were organized and structured. It also provides a general overview of the field of data science. I suggest starting with a basic and comprehensive resource like that one. Then you will easily build your own learning path. You don\u2019t have to collect lots of certificates on any topic.", "Last but not least, maybe the most important one, is doing projects. They are what get you ready for the job. Projects consolidate different skills into one. They also serve as a showcase to display your skills.", "Do projects after the basics are covered.", "Data science has lots of applications in different industries. The goal of businesses is to create value out of data. Thus, learning the algorithms or tools to analyze data is not enough to land a job. You should start doing projects related to the area you want to work in. Doing projects will not only help you obtain a more comprehensive knowledge but also bring more optimal tools and frameworks to your plate. Depending on the project, certain tools will outperform others and better fit to your style. Here is a list of my 5 reasons to do projects:", "To sum up, it doesn\u2019t really matter how you learn. If you are passionate about learning data science, the path you follow does not make a difference. Whatever fits your learning style will do the job. The most important thing is to start your journey and, of course, do projects after you cover the basics.", "Thank you for reading.
