A catscatter function built over matplotlib.pyplot object and using pandas to visualize relationships between your categorial variables as if it were a scatter plot. (I know, there\u2019re no correlations here, but it looks like it and its built on a scatter plot, right?).", "I work as a Data Analyst using a bit of Data Science and a lot of Data Visualization. Last December a coworker gave me for Christmas the book \u201cKnowledge is Beautiful\u201d which I loved. Its Data Visualizations are amazing and really complex. I like to read it when I want to get inspired.", "At the same time, I work for a VC fund, where frameworks and relationships are really important. Showing relationships between categorical variables is not always an easy thing due to their \u201cstring\u201d nature.", "These two situations motivated me to create and use a catscatter function. This function is based in scatter plots relationships but uses categorical variables in a beautiful and simple way. Actually, the visualization is closer to an \u201cadjacency matrix\u201d than a \u201cscatter plot\u201d: it means that we are not interested in where the markers are to find correlations but on which categories are connected to each other, or which ones are more connected to something than to something else. They can be seen as a kind of \u201cgraph\u201d relationships. For that purpose it was important to not only plot the markers in the intersections between features but to draw horizontal and vertical lines in the background to follow easily the connections.", "The function is built for Python over Matplotlib and Pandas. It has the following inputs:", "There\u2019s no output. The object is not closed so it can be initiated or changed by the user before and after.", "Imagine you invite some of your friends to have dinner at home. You can build a catscatter to see everyone favorite food and buy what\u2019s more suitable for all of them. You need a DataFrame containing the relationships between your friends and food. For example, you know that Ignacio loves Hamburguers but also likes Pizza, so you built a relationship between \u201cIgnacio\u201d and \u201cHamburguer\u201d with a grade \u201c5\u201d and a relationship between \u201cIgnacio\u201d and \u201cPizza\u201d of grade \u201c3\u201d. You do the same for everything you know about your friends and plot a catscatter.", "Here you can see that Pizza is the most liked food, but if you are inviting Bea and Peter maybe ordering Salmon Tataki is the best option. Don\u2019t waste your time buying fruit. For Marc, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve only had desserts with him, you should invite him to a dinner to gather more data!", "This example is the same than the one before but bigger and more colorful.", "At my office we wanted to know which EU Seed Investors are more active in which Industries. I gather information about all the seed rounds between 2015 and 2019 in Europe and prepare a dataset with the number of deals each Investor made by Industry (if no deals there\u2019s no row). The number of deals is how strong or weak is the relationship between the Industry and the Investor.", "We had 700 Investors and 600 Industries, but for this visualization I only leave the top 100 Investors and top 50 Industries more active. At my office we created two posters that you can find here and here.", "In the one displayed here, you can see that \u201cHigh-Tech Grunderfonds\u201d made deals in almost all of the top sectors, but with more focus on \u201cInformation Technology\u201d and \u201cSoftware\u201d. Also \u201cInnogest Capital\u201d and \u201cInbox Capital\u201d have made nearly the same number of deals, but \u201cInbox Capital\u201d is generalist and \u201cInnogest Capital\u201d focused only on \u201cEcommerce\u201d and \u201cFashion\u201d. We can see also that \u201cAdvertising\u201d is not really common but \u201cSoftware\u201d is, and there\u2019re Investors that focus on \u201cMedical\u201d but not on \u201cTravel\u201d", "I can\u2019t share the df used for the last one, but I hope it helps seeing the potential of my little piece of code at a bigger scale.", "If you want to try catscatter here\u2019s the code for you! \ud83d\udc47", "What do you think? Do you find it useful? What other ways do you have to plot relations between categorical features?
