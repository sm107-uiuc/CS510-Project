At its core, it\u2019s highly technical and mathematical. But you can\u2019t begin to scratch the surface of machine learning if you can\u2019t understand technical properties in a non-technical way. For example, if you go for a data scientist interview, you\u2019ll inevitably be asked, \u201ccan you explain underfitting and overfitting concerning machine learning?\u201d. They\u2019re not looking for you to pull out graphs; instead, they want to know you understand the concept. So, what exactly is underfitting and overfitting in machine learning?", "Let\u2019s start with an easy to understand example. Let\u2019s say you train your dog to raise its paw when you wave your left hand. You\u2019ve got a smart dog, and he learns it quickly and gets it right every time. However, there\u2019s a problem. When your friend tries to emulate your left-handed wave, your dog looks blankly at them. Confused, you demonstrate the trick again, only this time you use your right hand. Your dog is still staring blankly, but why? It turns out your dog only learned how to do the trick when he sees your left hand make the motion. Additionally, he only learned to do it when you make the gesture, so he will never respond to your friend, no matter what hand your friend uses. This is overfitting.", "Put simply, overfitting is when you have a machine learning model that tries to adapt itself too much to the data that you have. It occurs when a machine learning algorithm or statistical model captures the noise of the data and shows low bias but high variance. In machine learning, bias refers to the error that occurs from overly simplistic or faulty assumptions. So a high bias means the algorithm has missed significant trends among the features. In a high variance situation, the model fits the data very well but isn\u2019t good at working with new data sets because it captured all of the randomness in the training data. To put it another way, it happens when the model or algorithm fits the data too well for the model to be effective at its goal.", "As you may have guessed, underfitting is the opposite of overfitting. It\u2019s marked by low variance and high bias. Instead of the model following the training data too well, it ignores the lessons and fails to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. For example, the model might see many zebras with stripes but it doesn\u2019t understand that all zebras have stripes.", "Generally, underfitting is talked about less than overfitting because it\u2019s much easier to detect. If your model is underfitting, then you should spot it easily and be able to correct it quickly before moving forward. By contrast, overfitting often isn\u2019t spotted until later down the line. Still, underfitting can\u2019t be ignored. To avoid overfitting or underfitting, you should use validation and cross-validation to assess predictive accuracy.", "In some areas, overfitting and underfitting could be harmful. Think of a model trying to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign. You definitely wouldn\u2019t want it to overfit and make false predictions.", "So now that you understand the concept of overfitting and underfitting, you know the importance of detecting them when they occur and avoiding them when possible.", "Your home for data science.
