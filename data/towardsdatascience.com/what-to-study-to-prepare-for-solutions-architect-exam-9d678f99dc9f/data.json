Great choice! One of the ways to achieve it is to pass an appropriate certification. At the moment, the most popular are AWS Solutions Architect, Azure Solutions Architect, and Google Cloud Architect. Getting certified verifies that you acquired certain knowledge and you are able to design complex systems. I am going to guide you through the necessary basics for preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect exam. However, those basics can be successfully applied for other certifications.", "Becoming a solutions architect is not an easy task. It requires being a good engineer in the first place. That means you already know algorithms well and know how to apply them efficiently. A good developer has experience in designing systems with complex architecture. Take some time preparing well for it and focus on the following basics.", "This is the essential pillar in any cloud system. No matter what is behind the scene in the cloud \u2014 real physical server or virtual environment. The things which are important for us are a dedicated place to run the app and an ability to handle the workload properly. Therefore, it is key to understand the concept of provisioning different types of computation systems. If the application consumes a lot of computing resources, then the system should have enough CPU and RAM. If the application performs many I/O operations, then the system needs to have a focus on provisioning that. Understanding the necessity of the application helps to define the requirements for the system. For example on Amazon, Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) is a service providing computing capacity. It has various types of instances to satisfy different demands. Making a proper choice can also save costs.", "Apart from that, scalability issues might appear once the user base increases. Here comes the concept of auto-scaling. It increases the number of computing machines automatically if there are not enough resources. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is the service in AWS for that. And when more and more machines come to duty, the traffic should be equally distributed between them. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is another service in AWS to help with this challenge.", "When the application is simple, it is possible to turn it to serverless. It means neither servers nor load balancers will be provisioned. Everything is handled by the cloud that scales up and down automatically based on traffic. The application can be a function or a chain of functions. The cloud system is responsible to execute them hence the name serverless. Amazon Lambda is the service to execute those functions.", "There are many various types of storage available \u2014 object storage, block storage, or file systems for different OS. Each of them serves its own purpose and application. As a solution architect, you should be able to select a proper one to satisfy the requirements, guarantee good performance, and make it cost-effective.", "Object storage (in AWS it is S3) is used for simple objects such as videos, images, documents, etc. It provides high durability of the data and can be used as a place for assets of your application.", "Block storage (AWS EBS) is high-performance storage with block-level structure. This type of storage can be attached only to one machine at the same time. But there is an option to detach it and use it later on another machine.", "File system storage (AWS EFS) provides a common structure like files and folders. It is good for scenarios when shared access to the data required within a computation fleet. It acts as a network drive and can be used at the same time by multiple consumers.", "should have a clear understanding of how data are organized in databases. Before choosing a database ask yourself the following questions:", "There are different database types: relational and non-relational. It is crucial to select a proper database for the solution as it defines performance and scalability in the future. With relational databases, the data are more structured and that enables us to run different kinds of queries. Non-relational databases organize saving and querying data in a different way (for example as a key-value store). That makes it easier to perform scaling horizontally.", "Next thing is to choose if it is serverless or not. Serverless databases are maintained and scaled by the cloud automatically. DynamoDB from AWS is a serverless non-relational database where data is organized as key-value storage. For relational databases, AWS offers RDS with different engines along with Aurora and Aurora Serverless (both proprietary databases from Amazon).", "Besides that, you have to keep in mind how many read and write operations will be made. For example, if a database is being read by many other departments in an organization, then consider using read replicas. In case, there are a lot of reads of the same data, then caching frequent requests with Elasticache is your option.", "Understanding of what is a public and a private network. In distributed systems communication is organized over the network. Limiting access to specific resources in a network with Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is a powerful tool. Moreover, it is an essential part of a secure solution. For sure nobody wants to have public access to the database. Instead of that, the database should be in a private network and should allow inbound traffic only from the defined sources.", "Dedicate some time to learn how TCP/IP protocol works, check different network topologies. That should bring light on how to build a system with a single entry point to the Internet, how to allow outbound traffic only, and how to protect from different attacks and have a stable resilient solution.", "Amazon has a rich set of services for networking. There are only a few of them: subnets, security groups, VPC, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Web Application Firewall.", "I tried to collect the basics necessary for preparation for the AWS Solutions Architect exam. No matter what your current goal \u2014 get ready for any certification or expanding the knowledge further, being able to establish resilient and scalable architecture is a strong skill with a good pay off.", "Your home for data science.
