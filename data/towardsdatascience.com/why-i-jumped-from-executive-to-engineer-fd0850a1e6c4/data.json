Hawking, Black Holes and Baby Universes", "Remember trying to find your first job? Every recruiter wants experience. As an entry-level applicant, you don\u2019t have any. Eventually, somebody might take a chance on you based on how you interview, your grades, or some intangible quality they perceive in you, the first-time job seeker.", "For many of us, including me, chance events have an outsize impact on career trajectory. Evidence in peer-reviewed studies backs this up. My lucky break was getting to work at a start-up that needed help with just about every business function. This was my opportunity to learn on the job and figure out where I could specialize and build a focused career.", "The difficulties and distractions of demanding day-to-day work meant that it took me years to really be honest with myself as to what I wanted to do and the risk I\u2019d need to take to do it. I distilled my own experience down to three reasons why I changed career tracks, and how circumstances of my own chance involvement with the startup world helped me to develop a much better understanding of my own strengths and weaknesses.", "\u201cHow did it get so late so soon?\u201d \u2015 Dr. Seuss", "When I was finishing up my MBA at San Diego State University in 2009, I only had a vague idea of what I wanted to do next. I\u2019d spent a considerable amount of time living and working in China, including a semester at Sun Yat-Sen University\u2019s business school, so I thought \u201cinternational business\u201d sounded cool as a next step. Instead, I hooked up with a startup pharmacy automation company in the San Diego area as a marketing intern.", "My role quickly evolved into a full-time position as the company\u2019s Swiss army knife. One early project was managing the first pilot installation of our robotic inventory system. That meant spending 7 days per week, 10\u201312 hours per day on site managing the customer relationship, logging test results, doing ad-hoc data analysis, and learning SQL on the fly. I\u2019d never had any exposure to tech before, and had to acquire new skills and tools almost overnight in order to just be able to do my job.", "Over the next ten years I started our initial strategic marketing push and built up the marketing tech side myself, functioned as a product manager, built up our SaaS infrastructure to support operations, acted as a technical sales lead, performed frequent ad-hoc data analysis, wrote SQL-based workarounds, hired and built up the technical implementation and support teams, managed IT projects, and managed key account relationships. I also increasingly devoted more and more time to individual contributor projects, mostly because there were things I wanted to get done that we simply didn\u2019t have the bandwidth for on the dev side. So I kept picking up more and more tech skills, especially in data science and software engineering. I loved all of it, especially the way I could rapidly put into practice what I\u2019d learned.", "I eventually got promoted to Executive VP, and our growth really started to accelerate late last year. Then I decided to quit.", "\u201cIt is not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?\u201d \u2015 Henry David Thoreau", "For a long time, whatever my title was didn\u2019t matter or really have any bearing on what I was doing day-to-day. Anyone who has ever worked in a typical startup environment can probably relate. If I was SVP of Desk Chair Upholstery, I would still be on the road at tradeshows, working on analytics projects, building web applications, managing complex technical implementation projects, hiring and firing, etc. We were always anemic on support staff, without dedicated resources for HR or IT. That doesn\u2019t matter so much when you\u2019re small, but it becomes critical with growth and the need for standardization.", "For me, I got to the point in 2018 where I was putting in a regular work week on organizational tasks and management, then almost another work week on top of that to keep up with individual contributor projects. We had neither the budget nor internal inclination to support what I was doing individually with additional resources. I found myself with a full-time job and a hobby, which was also part of my job. This was completely unsustainable in the long run.", "The sheer volume and complexity of work that I was confronted with either managing or handling myself caused other problems. Working hard is intrinsic for me, but I could not devote enough time to any one task, and I started worrying that I could not live up to my own (admittedly high) standards.", "\u201cWherever smart people work, doors are unlocked.\u201d \u2015Steve Wozniak", "I was also increasingly finding myself immersed in analytics and data science, both at work and in what spare time I had for self-education. I love bootstrapping new skills, and I spent hours working through learning modules on DataCamp and doing katas at CodeWars. But I had nobody else at my company with similar interests or skills, and tended to be met with blank stares when I would describe a current project or solicit feedback. This led to another problem, which was a persistent feeling that I was being undervalued, and was working with other senior leaders who couldn\u2019t really assess my performance because they had no specific technical competence to do so. This was not their fault or even a shortcoming, it was rather a question of the specific priorities of the business and allocation of limited resources.", "I wanted to be somewhere that really valued applied data science, data governance, and was actively seeking to drive value based on thoughtful applications of business analytics. When I was contacted through LinkedIn by one of the managing partners at a Dutch IT and analytics consultancy, I was ready to make the leap. I didn\u2019t care about titles, but I did want to be somewhere with like-minded professionals I could learn from and who felt the same way I did about the value of data when analytics projects are done correctly.", "Joining a consultancy as a data engineer and scrum master was absolutely the right move for my own professional aspirations and desire for personal growth. I have no regrets about my decision. In the end, the hardest part was summoning the nerve to leave my corporate home of 10 years and take the risk that I was in touch with what I really wanted in my career.", "I signed up for their paid service several years ago, and never looked back. It\u2019s a fantastic way to keep skills current and get exposure to data science methods in both R and Python.", "Nothing substitutes for hands-on experience, but if you want to sharpen skills and learn new ones in data science or software development, it\u2019s a fantastic service.", "I felt like I needed a more immersive experience to tie everything I was learning ad-hoc together, so I signed up for the Firehose Project\u2019s bootcamp about a year and a half ago. They paired me with a coding mentor, and I devoted evenings and weekends for almost a year to working through their curriculum.", "Ken Mazaika is the guy behind it, and his methodology really worked for me.", "Your home for data science.
