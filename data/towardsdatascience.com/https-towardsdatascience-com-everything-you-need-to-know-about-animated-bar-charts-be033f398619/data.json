There are usually 3 variables involved in making an animated bar chart, one of which is, more often than not, the time variable. The remaining two variables are", "The following are some of the examples of the animated bar charts (images from Google, credits given to the owners):", "In this article, I would address two key points:", "Of course, you can find a lot of different sources online on how to create an animated bar chart. There are various tools available to create such a barplot like Tableau, Power BI, Visme, Flourish and so on. However, more often than not, these tools are not available for free. Therefore I would like to introduce how to do it in R, a free statistical software available for everyone.", "Creating an animated barplot in R is not something new. You can definitely find a lot resources online on how to do this in R. However, just like many of my other articles, I would like to give you guys a simple yet detailed step-by-step guide (with some explanations and screenshots of how the data looks like in every step so that everyone can follow easily even without actually downloading the data and trying it on your own).", "If this sounds like your cup of Joe, let\u2019s get started!!", "We all love data story telling. However, it is not always easy to produce a graph/chart/plot that can tell a story and at the same time visually appealing to a great mass of audience. Since we want to provide much information and yet the same time not to bombard the viewer with too much information with one chart/plot, why not then create an animated visualization that combines all plots together?", "The animated bar chart helps us visualize the change in trends over time, these type of charts are very popular, especially on social media as they provide a holistic data story/insight in a concise and easy-to-understand chart.", "In this article, I will look at the nationalities of international students enrolled in Australian universities from 2002 to 2018 and see, throughout the years, what the top 10 nationalities are. The dataset is available here. Click \u2018Get the data\u2019 and then you are done.", "This is how the raw dataset looks like:", "The column \u2018Month\u2019 consists of 2 categories: Aug and Dec. Since the data for Aug intake is only available in 2019, I decided to use the data for Dec intake instead because the data is available in Dec from 2002 to 2018. So it is easier to create animated barplots. Note that in the end we only need 3 columns, namely Year, Nationalities and Students. That is enough to produce an animated bar plot. The final dataset would look like this:", "The process of cleaning the raw dataset to get the final dataset like above is straightforward and easy, with the use of Filter function and then delete the irrelevant rows and columns. I will not go through how to do it because it is not the main point of this article. If you have any difficulties doing it, let me know in the comment section. You can also import the raw data into R first and then use \u2018tidyverse\u2019 package to clean the data. However, since most of us open the downloaded file in Excel, why not just keep cleaning the data there :)?", "For now, let\u2019s assume we have obtained the final dataset that has only 3 columns. I would name it \u2018Dec Intake.xlsx\u2019.", "Now let\u2019s import this data into R, simply use read_excel () function", "Since we would like to create a barplot in such a way that for each year, only the top 10 nationalities are shown, we need to tidy the the dataset above a bit with \u2018tidyverse\u2019 package.", "Let me explain the code a bit:", "We now have a clean dataset ready for plotting. Let\u2019s move on to the next step.", "Let\u2019s create a new variable called \u2018anim\u2019. The following is the entire code for this section:", "Do not be taken aback by the codes above! They are actually quite straightforward, if you are familiar with the syntax in ggplot2. If you are new here, that\u2019s ok too because this article is for beginners. I will now explain every line of the code above.", "Here to create barplot, one can use geom_bar(). However, here I would like to introduce geom_tile(), which is to create tiles in the plot. This is particularly useful when we are handling 3 variables, namely Country, Students and Time. For geom_bar(), it is usually more useful if we work with 2 variables. Here is the helpsheet which I find extremely useful. You can also refer to it for more information.", "Now, why \u2018Students/2\u2019 and not just \u2018Students\u2019, or \u2018Students/3\u2019 and so on? Well let\u2019s just test them out:", "At this point, you must probably know why I chose Students/2 as an argument. Next part of the code would be:", "These 2 lines of codes allow us to determine the size of the labels, namely, Nationality names and The number of students.", "Here is the full list of themes in ggplot2 package. The source explains every single element that I used in the chunk above. So it really depends on how you want your animated bar plot to look like. For me, again, I would like my plot to look simple, so you can see that I put most of the arguments as element_blank(). So you can customise your themes whichever way you prefer.", "But I would like to draw your attention to this part:", "The first and third number show the top and bottom margin.", "The second and fourth numbers show the right and left margin.", "There is no fixed margin. Everything depends on the scale of your plot. In other words, this is trial-and-error process. For example, if the name of the country is long, you may want to increase the margin a bit so that it can fit into the frame. The above combination of margin (1,4,1,8) was obtained after a few trials.", "Cool! Now that we have static plots. Let\u2019s create transition to make animated chart.", "You can also use: enter_fade() + exit_fade() to make the transition smoother. For more information about the arguments, you can refer to the \u2018gganimate\u2019 package guide here. However, in my opinion, you do not need to use all the arguments introduced in the package. Just a few arguments like those I introduced here would suffice.", "For full list of arguments, you can also refer to the guide here.", "That is it! Hope you guys enjoyed and picked up something from this article. Next time when you guys encounter the animated trending barchart online or anywhere, I hope you all can feel confident in generating such a chart with a simple and free tool like R.", "If you have any questions, feel free to put them down in the comment section below. Let me know what kinds of dataset you guys use for this kind of chart. Thank you for your read. Have a great day and happy programming!!!", "Check out my other articles on Exploratory Data Analysis in R , Random Forest and Forecasting if you are interested in learning more about R!", "Your home for data science.
