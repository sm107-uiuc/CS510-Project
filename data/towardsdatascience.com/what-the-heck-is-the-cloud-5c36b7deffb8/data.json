Absolutely not. The cloud is incredible and brings a whole new world of opportunity if we choose to view it that way.", "Companies are migrating to the cloud at an unprecedented rate. You have the choice to either embrace, get ahead of it, and join them on their cloud transformation journey or be blind to it and get left behind.", "But first, we must have a baseline knowledge of what it is and how we can use it to improve our IT lives.", "This article will leave you with the knowledge you need to, at least, have a friendly conversation about the cloud.", "To understand all of the basics of \u201cthe cloud.\u201d", "I will first define a term that I hope you keep in mind for the rest of this piece. Then I will give you a history lesson on the foundation of cloud computing.", "We will then dive into how you managed your IT infrastructure before the cloud, what cloud computing looks like today, who the major players are, and how you can become a cloud expert.", "A relevant term to learn while understanding the cloud is abstraction.", "The act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations.", "When I first learned the idea of abstraction in computer science, an example of a gas pedal was used.", "When you are trying to make an automobile move forward, you don\u2019t care about what\u2019s going on inside the engine.", "You don\u2019t care about the throttle linkage that controls a valve that regulates the ratio of air intake and fuel injection to the engine.", "No. You press the gas pedal; the car moves forward. That\u2019s it. The underlying complexity is none of your concern. The gas pedal is simply an abstraction.", "In computer science and IT, in general, you will find the term abstraction everywhere. It\u2019s one of the three central principles of Object-Oriented Programming. But regardless of where you see it, it will always be used to represent a process for reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.", "The same is valid for understanding the cloud. The cloud aims to mask an incredible amount of underlying complexity to help you do your job more efficiently.", "Back in 1963, MIT was presented with a 2 million dollar project to create the first computer that can be used by two or more people at the same time.", "In 1969, the idea of the \u201cIntergalactic Computer Network\u201d was founded by J.C.R Licklider. An idea that everyone on the planet connects using one network. This ideology was the precursor to the \u201cInternet,\u201d an essential piece of the cloud.", "It wasn\u2019t until the 1990\u2019s when the idea of \u201cvirtual machines\u201d started to become relevant, and we were able to access complete operating systems over the internet. Of course, this was all due to the founding of the World Wide Web in 1991.", "In 1997, the term \u201ccloud\u201d was coined by Professor Ramnath Chellappa of Emory University to describe what we know of today as \u201ccloud computing.\u201d", "Finally, in 2002, Amazon stepped into the game. They launched their first public cloud.", "But not until 2006 was EC2 released from Amazon. The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) would allow users to rent virtual machines and use this service to develop applications from start to finish.", "This advancement would be the beginning of what we know today as cloud computing.", "Let me explain how you would host your IT infrastructure before the days of cloud computing.", "There are two types of traditional hosting: dedicated and shared.", "With this type of hosting, you are solely responsible for managing the hardware required to run your business.", "\u201cDedicated\u201d means buying all the physical components and the real estate it takes to house all of these components.", "This type of hosting comes with limitations. You lock into a predefined amount of bandwidth, CPU, RAM, drive space, etc.", "Anytime you want to scale, you have to order a new server, wait weeks or sometimes months for it to come, pay somebody to install and maintain it, and then manually configure it.", "These hardware concerns are a lot to worry about if you are a software company hoping to focus solely on writing software and innovating.", "This type of hosting is more common among small and medium-sized businesses.", "In this model, you are renting computing space from somebody else. You use one of their servers to host your site.", "A drawback to this? There are likely other sites hosted on the same server. If one day somebody else\u2019s traffic increases significantly, it could harm your site\u2019s performance.", "Shared hosting gives you less control over your website. Also, you are still paying for a finite amount of storage and processing power.", "Back to the concept of abstraction.", "Cloud computing enables us to not worry about any of the physical aspects of hosting our business. All the underlying complexity that comes with managing your IT infrastructure is taken care of by a cloud service provider.", "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).", "The important information to pull from this definition is that cloud computing offers us on-demand computing resources. This typically happens over the internet on a pay-as-you-go type model.", "No longer do we have to physically manage our underlying infrastructure. This means we don\u2019t have to:", "The speed at which our business can now scale is unprecedented. Never before have we had the ability to go from planning to production so quickly.", "It\u2019s broken down into three types: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Let\u2019s take a look at each:", "Infrastructure as a Service is when the infrastructure layer is abstracted. This allows us to manage our infrastructure with a virtual interface. If we want to add a load balancer or a server or any piece of hardware, we just click a button, and it\u2019s done.", "No longer do we have to order these components and install them ourselves.", "A popular example of IaaS is AWS\u2019s EC2 service.", "Platform as a Service is when the cloud provides a space to create and manage applications. This may include an operating system.", "This enables us to develop software without having to build and maintain the infrastructure needed.", "A popular example of PaaS is Google\u2019s App Engine.", "Software as a Service refers to being able to get any software where you want it when you want it. It is a software licensing and delivery model where the entire package is delivered over the internet.", "A popular example of SaaS is Microsoft\u2019s Office365.", "A couple of names you should be familiar with in the Cloud Computing space:", "Among the three highlighted (these are known as \u201cthe big 3\u201d cloud providers) AWS is currently dominating the market share. According to Larry Dignan from zdnet.com, AWS owns 60% of the market share, Azure owns 31% and Google Cloud Platform has 9%.", "Below are some notable examples of Platform as a Service (PaaS) tools:", "Let\u2019s take a look at some of the top Software as a Service (SaaS) providers:", "This piece was written during the global pandemic COVID-19. At the same time, I am working on getting certified in AWS as a Cloud Developer. While you are quarantining, take advantage of any new free time you may have.", "AWS, Microsoft, and Google offer certifications for all levels and all roles within IT.", "Become certified in cloud fundamentals, as an architect, as a developer, operations, networking, security, machine learning, data analytics, databases, and even more.", "The best way to learn about the cloud is to get hands-on experience. A great resource I found in assisting my learning is A Cloud Guru. They provide many fantastic labs for you to work through.", "Some resources I used during the research phase of writing this piece:", "A Brief History of Cloud Computing", "What Makes a Car Go When You Step On The Gas?", "Your home for data science.
