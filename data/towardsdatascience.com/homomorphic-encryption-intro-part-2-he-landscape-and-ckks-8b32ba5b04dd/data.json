The result of the computations on encrypted data can then be sent back to the data owner, which will be the only one able to decrypt the encrypted result.", "More formally, a ring homomorphism h between two rings R and R\u2019, satisfies those two properties :", "This means that if we have an encryption homomorphism e, a decryption homomorphism d, such that d(e(x)) = x, and a function f, which is a composition of additions and multiplications, then we can have the following scenario :", "HE schemes first started with RSA, which provided an homomorphic scheme, but only with homomorphic multiplication. This was the first Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), which are schemes with only one operation enabled. The other classes of HE schemes would be Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), with a limited number of operations, and the most interesting one, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which allows an arbitrary number of evaluations.", "Several HE schemes have been proposed since RSA such as Paillier in the paper \u201cPublic-Key Cryptosystems Based on Composite Degree Residuosity Classes\u201d for PHE, but it was only with the work of Craig Gentry that a first FHE scheme was proposed in his PhD thesis \u201cA Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme\u201d.", "Gentry\u2019s breakthrough was done by introducing bootstrapping to SWHE. The idea is that a SWHE encrypts a plaintext into a ciphertext by adding noise. Operations can be done on the ciphertext, but at the cost of increasing the noise, and if too many operations are done, decryption will provide wrong results. Gentry\u2019s boostrapping technique allowed to remove the noise in a ciphertext, and therefore allow unlimited operations on ciphertexts.", "While bootstrapping gave a theoretical framework for FHE, it was too inefficient to be used in practice. Since then, more practical schemes have emerged such as BGV and BFV for integer arithmetic, and CKKS for arithmetic on real numbers.", "For the rest of this series on HE, we will focus on CKKS, a leveled homomorphic encryption scheme, which means that addition and multiplication are possible, but a limited number of multiplications is possible. While bootstrapping is available in CKKS, this operation is still costly, and makes it less usable in practice.", "We will now focus on the CKKS scheme here. This section will cover the basis of CKKS, and we will see in later articles how we can implement it.", "The figure above provides a high level view of CKKS. We can see that a message m, which is a vector of values on which we want to perform computation, is first encoded into a plaintext polynomial p(X) then encrypted using a public key.", "CKKS works with polynomials because they provide a good tradeoff between security and efficiency, compared to standard computations on vectors.", "Once the message is encrypted into c, which is a couple of polynomials, CKKS provides several operations that can be performed on it, such as addition, multiplication and rotation.", "While addition is pretty straightforward, multiplication has the particularity of increasing a lot the noise kept in the ciphertext, therefore to manage it, only a limited number of multiplications are allowed. Rotations are permutations on the slots of a given ciphertext.", "If we denote by f a function which is a composition of homomorphic operations, then we have that decrypting c\u2019 = f(c) with the secret key will yield p\u2019 = f(p). Therefore once we decode it, we will get m = f(m).", "This gives us a high level view of how CKKS works, and we will see in the next articles how to implement the crypto-primitives necessary to implement such a scheme, which are:", "We saw how HE works in general, what are the different types of HE schemes, and had a preview of the CKKS scheme for approximate arithmetic on real numbers.", "This gave us a high level view of what HE really is, and will pave the way for the next articles where we will dig into the code and implement CKKS from scratch.", "I hope you liked this article, and get ready for the next article where we will see how we can encode vectors into polynomials in a homomorphic setting!", "If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me on Linkedin , you can also find me on Twitter !", "Your home for data science.
