You can check out the prediction for previous Game Week and how it fared against the actual performance here.", "Expected Goals or xG is the parameter used for prediction. If you are interested in understanding the algorithm for prediction, I recommend that you check out this article where it is explained in detail.", "After 7game weeks, 6 points separates the top 13 teams there are no clear title contenders as of now. The league is highly competitive and there are no unbeaten sides. The competitiveness of the league cannot be better summed up than by the following quote by the Special One:", "You win one game and you are 2nd, 3rd or 4th. You lose 2 points you are 7th, 8th or 9th. The Premier League is beautiful!-Jose Mourinho", "After 7 gameweeks, the defending champions who are back to the number one spot on table, looks to be the best attacking side averaging around 2.5 xG per game. The Reds create more than 0.5 xG per game more than the Spurs who are at the second position. Leicester, Aston Villa, Leeds and Everton are the other teams who create more than 1.5xG per game.", "Crystal Palace, Sheffield United, Wolves and Burnley who rely on defensive style of play are struggling with creativity not even able to create 1 xG per game. West Brom is in a very precarious position struggling with creating chances to score as well as containing the opposition attack.", "When it comes to expected Goals Conceded per game, there is not a great difference between the teams. Most teams concede between 1 to 1.5 xG per game. Only Fulham, Man United, West Brom and Leeds conceded more than 1.5xG per game.", "Based on xG Scored and xG Conceded, teams can be grouped into 4 quadrants as shown in the above graph. The horizontal dotted line shows the average xG scored per game. Teams above the horizontal dotted line are strong attacking sides and the teams below weak in attack.The vertical dotted line shows average xG conceded per game, teams to the left of have strong defence and the teams to the right have week defence.", "The Reds, despite their defence not being as great as that it used to be in the previous season, manage to top the delta-xG chart, thanks to Salah and Co.\u2019s attacking prowess.", "Before proceeding to the predictions, let me clarify that this is a very simple algorithm just based on past xG, so only baseline performance can be expected. The sample size is very small and also a lot of other important factors are not considered. The algorithm will evolve in the future incorporating more factors as the season progresses. The algorithm also fails to predict high scoring games.", "Prediction accuracy of the method has been improved over the Gameweeks. In the last gameweek, the algorithm was able to correctly predict the direction of 9 out of 10 matches.", "Predictions for Game Week 8 are provided in the table below. The absolute value of GD shows the competitiveness of the match. The higher the value, more one sided the match is expected to be and higher the accuracy of prediction. The lower the value of GD, the more the match could be anybody\u2019s game. Positive value of GD means Home win and Negative value means Away team win.", "The highlight of this game week is the Super Sunday Match between Liverpool vs Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. The algorithm, even though it cannot factor in the change in tactical approach of Klopp and Pep, predicts it to be a high scoring match. However, the expected Goal Difference indicates Liverpool would leave Etihad with all the 3 points. The Gunners are also expected to lose at home in their upcoming match against the Villans. West Brom vs Spurs is predicted to be the most one sided match, with Kane and Co. expected to steamroll over the shambolic West Brom defence.", "The Toffees are expected to come back to winning ways, after two consecutive defeats, in their home match against the Red Devils. The Foxes, the Blues, the Hammers and the Seagulls can also expect home wins.", "Saints vs Magpies and Eagles vs Peacocks are expected to be anybody\u2019s game with Ralph Hasenhuttl and Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s sides having a slight edge over their opponents.", "In the Game Week 8 our prediction was in the right direction for 6 out of 10 matches. However the predictions were not very accurate, only 3 predictions were withing 0.5xG accuracy.Predictions were most accurate for Arsenal vs Aston Villa. For Chelsea vs Sheffield match the predictions were off by almost 2xG, Chelsea was expected to create more chances. However such a great domination was not estimated. The only real \u2018upset\u2019 of the weekend was Everton vs Manchester United match, our prediction was a comfortable win for the Toffees at home, but Man United pulled out a great performance to snatch all the 3 points, thanks to individual brilliance of Bruno!West Ham vs Fulham match, the prediction was Hammers dominating the match the result was also 1\u20130 in favor of David Moyes\u2019 side. However, the Cottagers created more chances thanks to a penalty kick awarded in their favor which Lookman missed. Pep vs Klopp is a highly unpredictable fixture, our prediction for the Super Sunday clash between the giants was slightly in favor of the German. The match ended up in a draw after a closely contested match. Man City created more xG than the Champions, thanks to a penalty kick awarded in favor of City which KDB shot wide of the post! If that penalty was not awarded, our prediction was very precise.", "Your home for data science.
