Oh\u2026 right. It is a pandemic.", "You and I are living a historic moment, this year 2020 will be highlighted in the history books as the 2020 pandemic event that changed the world forever. Our generation is part of a modern plague that may be created because of us tearing apart the planet, or maybe it was designed in a lab or maybe just the wrong pangolin meet the wrong pig, and let\u2019s call it faith. You are free to choose what to believe but there is a fact beyond any doubt: Life as you know it will change a lot. Coronavirus also known as SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay in our economy, in our habits, in our fears and in the air(?).", "But hey not everything is bad! There is good news! Remember the other pandemic event everyone is talking about \u201cThe Spanish Flu\u201d or \u201c1918 flu pandemic\u201d that killed around 500 million people? Well we are far more advanced technologically speaking, we have artificial intelligence, faster communications, social media, a better understanding of breakouts, antibiotics, and of course the capacity to create a vaccine and distributed around the world to eradicate the virus just like we did with other viruses.", "The problem is that to create a vaccine takes a lot of time, once clinical trials show that the vaccine is effective, producing a large amount of it can take around four years. That timeline includes designing, building, qualifying and licensing a manufacturing facility, and then producing adequate amounts of the vaccine to get to market.", "Now 4 years sounds like a long time to \u201cget back to normal\u201d this is why people are talking about the #NewNormal or #TheNextNormal meaning you can keep on with your life or business but with some considerations or measures such as social distancing, hands hygiene and the use of face mask. Some of these measures are not even a suggestion, they have become law and for a very good reason, they can help to slow down the contagion and save hundreds of thousands of people.", "Once someone gets infected virus particles become suspended in the bodily fluids in our lungs, mouth, and nose. Then when an infected person coughs, they can send showers of tiny droplets filled with the virus into the air.", "Sars-CoV-2 virus has been found to survive in these droplets for at least three hours. But other unofficial studies suggest that the Sars-CoV-2 virus is still infectious for more than 16 hours after being suspended in aerosol droplets. It found the virus was \u201cremarkably resilient in aerosol form\u201d compared to other similar coronaviruses they studied.", "Also research shows the six-foot social distancing policy is not enough if even a light wind (around 2 mph) is present, droplets from a cough can carry farther than six feet.", "Then how can we enforce some of these recommendations? Well I strongly believe artificial intelligence can be a key element to enforce some of these measures, specifically computer vision can be used to identify risks efficiently.", "What is computer vision? And how does it work? I like this definition:", "\u201cComputer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects \u2026.\u201d", "Basically, you use image and video data to teach a computer to detect and recognize objects of interest. For example teach a system to spot if a person is wearing a mask or not.", "Think we can use this trained computer vision model to monitor streets, supermarkets and public transportation, parks detecting who is wearing a mask and who is not, identifying risks and mapping areas that may be a potential focus of infection. Let\u2019s see how does it look like a model trained to recognize \u201cface-mask wearing\u201d:", "I believe this use case has a couple of aspects to examine:", "(Either) Tactical: Take action as soon as a risk is identified like unmasked visitors. For example, an entrance to a mall, supermarket, schools, office building, etc. can be monitor 24/7 by cameras looking for people not wearing masks representing a risk for other people.", "(Or) Strategical, meaning gets as much information as possible and map high-risk zones where it is needed to deploy stronger controls, communications, and more effective enforcement. By generating decision making data governments and private organizations are able to optimize controls, save money, and provide a safer environment for people.", "Perhaps it seems a simple strategy to \u201cenforce wearing masks\u201d but everyone not wearing a mask is a liability for others, we must understand that by doing so we are saving lives.", "I believe a very strong ally in this battle is of course artificial intelligence and technology, people around the world are helping with apps, websites, analytics models, and incredible use cases to help because in the end we are all together in this. #StayHome #StaySafe.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
