To build on this, it will be nice to look through the proportion of non-chain to chain establishments.", "There\u2019s a large share (~2/3) of small players (non-chain establishments) in the current LA market.", "Cafes have a higher chance of being a chain establishment. In addition, around 1/3 (31.6%) of restaurants belong to chains; this is likely the reason why non-chains were well represented in the pie chart earlier.", "This figure parallels the findings of an in-depth study (5,000 surveys and more than 100 interviews) conducted by Allegra World Coffee, which indicated that nearly 4 out of 5 (78%) coffee shops are chain establishments \u2014 and that proportion is only growing.", "These figures suggest that in the long term, it would be more prudent to open a restaurant than a cafe.", "This visualization shows us that, with a median of 25 seats per establishment, chains lean toward having many establishments with a low number of seats (1\u201350 seats) \u2014 characterizes about 82% of establishments.", "So for the chain establishments, the few seat proportion for each establishment type falls near 80%, if not more, above that percentage.", "Notice that the graph shows that the \u201cmany seat\u201d proportion for establishment types, of which restaurants have by far the greatest share, where likely the reason of bringing the aggregate \u201cfew seats\u201d proportion down to 80%.", "Moreover, the few seats percentage for restaurants establishment indicates that there are many small chain restaurants in LA.
