There are many formal definitions but essentially a fraud is an \u201cart\u201d and crime of deceiving and scamming people in their financial transactions. Frauds have always existed throughout human history but in this age of digital technology, the strategy, extent and magnitude of financial frauds is becoming wide-ranging \u2014 from credit cards transactions to health benefits to insurance claims. Fraudsters are also getting super creative. Who\u2019s never received an email from a Nigerian royal widow that she\u2019s looking for trusted someone to hand over large sums of her inheritance?", "No wonder why is fraud a big deal. Estimated loses in business organizations soar up to 4\u20135% of their revenues due to fraudulent transactions. A 5% fraud may not sound a lot, but in monetary terms, it is non-trivial and outweighs the costs of not doing anything by a large margin. A PwC survey found that 50% of 7,200 companies they surveyed had been victims of fraud of some kind. A very recent study by FICO found that 4 out of 5 banks in their survey have experienced an increase in fraud activities and this is expected to rise in the future.", "Although many organizations took measures to counter frauds, it could never be eradicated. The goal is really to minimize its impacts. The benefits of this screening must be weighed against the costs, such as, investment in fraud detection technology and potentially losing customers due to \u201cfalse positive\u201d alarms.", "So the purpose of this article is to highlight some tools, techniques and best practices in the field of fraud detection. Towards the end, I\u2019ll provide a python implementation using publicly available dataset.", "Frauds are everywhere \u2014 wherever a transaction is involved\u2014 but credit card fraud is probably the most known case. It can be as primitive as stealing or using stolen cards, to aggressive forms such as account takeover, counterfeiting and more. Credit card frauds have always existed but the magnitude is only growing recently due to increasing online transactions taking place through credit cards every day. According to a Nilson Report in 2010, the amount of global fraud was USD 7.6 billion and is expected to cross a whopping USD 31 billion in 2020. In the UK alone fraudulent transactions losses were estimated at more than USD 1 billion in 2018.", "The other kinds of big fraud cases are ongoing in insurance industries. Some estimates suggest that as much as 10% of health insurance claims in the US can be attributed to fraud \u2014 which is a non-trivial amount of USD 110 billion annually.", "Insurance fraud is so widespread that there is an entire organization called Coalition Against Insurance Fraud and a journal called Journal of Insurance Fraud to scientifically study frauds in the insurance business.", "In the past (i.e. before machine learning became the trend) the standard practice was to use the so-called \u201cRule-based approach\u201d. Since every rule has an exception, this technique was able to only partially mitigate the problem. With ever-increasing online transactions and production of a large volume of customer data, machine learning has been increasingly seen as an effective tool to detect and counter frauds. However, there is no specific tool, the silver bullet, that works for all kinds of fraud detection problems in every single industry. The nature of the problem is different in every case and every industry. Therefore every solution is carefully tailored within the domain of each industry.", "In machine learning, parlance fraud detection is generally treated as a supervised classification problem, where observations are classified as \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cnon-fraud\u201d based on the features in those observations. It is also an interesting problem in ML research due to imbalanced data \u2014 i.e. there\u2019s a very few cases of frauds in an extremely large amount of transactions. How to deal with imbalance classes is itself a subject of another discussion.", "Frauds are also isolated using several outlier detection techniques. Outlier detection tools have their own way of tackling the problem, such as time series analysis, cluster analysis, real-time monitoring of transactions etc.", "Supervised ML algorithms: logistic regression, neural net, time-series analysis", "Unsupervised ML algorithms: Cluster analysis, Bayesian network, Peer group analysis, break point analysis, Benford\u2019s law (law of anomalous numbers)", "For this simple demo I am using a popular Kaggle dataset.", "The dataset has 31 columns. The first column \u201cTime\u201d is transaction timestamp, second last column \u201cAmount\u201d is transaction amount and the last column \u201cClass\u201d designates whether transaction as fraud or non-fraud (fraud = 1, non-fraud = 0). The rest of the columns, \u201cV1\u201d to \u201cV28\u201d are unknown variables which were transformed before making the data public.", "This is an extremely unbalanced dataset so we need to take a subsample by so called under-sampling.", "Note: Do not use accuracy score as a metric. In a dataset with 99.9% non-fraud observations, you will likely make correct prediction 99% of time. Confusion matrix and precision/recall score are better metric.", "Thanks for reading this through. A Jupyter notebook along with the python demo can be found in GitHub repo. I can be reached via Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
