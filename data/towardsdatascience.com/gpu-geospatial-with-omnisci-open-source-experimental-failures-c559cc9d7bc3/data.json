To get started I simply search for OmniSci in the docker registry and click \u201cCreate\u201d. I attach the GPU to the docker container and that is mostly it.", "As I am using the Open Source version there isn\u2019t much in the way of a UI so I SSH into my QNAP and connect to the docker container using docker exec -ti and start by loading some data", "Load Data you say? How old school.", "By this point, I am already feeling pretty put off. Much like Redshift, if you want to see the benefits of this database engine, you have to load data into it.", "I use the same dataset I have been using for the other tests, I whip up a DDL statement to create a table and then use the COPY command to pull in my Las Vegas dataset", "So this is my first disappointment, I haven\u2019t really had to load data into a \u201cdatabase\u201d for a while (BigQuery excepted) \u2014 much preferring to work directly on the columnar files such as ORC or Parquet.", "The process finished after 53 Minutes (Loading was from SATA drives)", "OmniSci first requires that I switch the session to GPU mode by issuing \\gpu", "Ok, so first thing first let's check to see the data has all loaded correctly, let\u2019s run a few count queries and then let's try with some real Geospatial stuff.", "As usual with any new Database engine there was a fair bit of Trial and Error, some things didn\u2019t work as expected and other fields required specific data-types that I wasn\u2019t aware of. Also, there were a number of arbitrary limits that whilst aren\u2019t deal-breakers are an annoyance, to say the least:", "Time Taken: unknown \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get it to finish (I gave it 3 hours)", "The container would max out its CPU but the GPU would sit there doing nothing \u2014 I assume this is because it is trying to shuttle information back and forth between the GPU and CPU or just tries to plan out everything on the CPU.", "I verified that the query planner was using the GPU using \u201cEXPLAIN SELECT\u201d but unfortunately either this Database platform requires much better hardware than I currently have or there is something else going on.Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem like it is actually processing anything. I will reach out to the OmniSci team to see if there is anything I can do.", "I am unsure what the problem is here \u2014 perhaps my query is not efficient for this platform, perhaps it would be better to do a join to the table rather than the method I am currently using. If I try it out and can get it to work I will update the article.", "I will also probably revisit this via their free trial hosted on a cloud service when I get some time, but frankly, if it can\u2019t even handle some basic point in polygon geospatial counts on my admittedly tired GPU, then I don\u2019t think it can really compete against other solutions that already manage it both traditionally.", "The hunt for a GPU Geospatial solution continues\u2026", "Your home for data science.
