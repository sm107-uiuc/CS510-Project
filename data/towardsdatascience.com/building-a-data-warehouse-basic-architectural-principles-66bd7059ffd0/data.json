However, such a large amount of resources sometimes can be overwhelming \u2014 or at least it was for us when we started to build our data warehouse.", "Originally, when we started shaping our data warehouse architecture, the first question we asked was: what is the right architecture for a Data Warehouse? Then, after some research, we realized there is no right or wrong architecture. It always depends on your needs.", "Nonetheless, there are some useful architectural principles recognized in the industry you should keep in mind when starting to build your data warehouse. Particularly, three basic principles that helped us a lot when building our data warehouse architecture were:", "After we started following such principles, the data warehousing process got a little bit easier. So, in this post, we want to share with you some things about such architectural principles and how they helped us to set up the architecture of our data warehouse. Furthermore, we want to share with you our first attempt to build a data warehouse in AWS.", "This principle follows the Separation of concerns principle. It is based on the assumption that every system should take care of a concern in a way that such concern should be encapsulated by the system itself.", "Particularly, data warehousing can be separated into four concerns that can be thought of as parts of a data pipeline: collect, store, process/analyze, and consume \u2014 check Siva Raghupathy\u2019s talk for more information. So, every system that is part of our data pipeline should encapsulate the responsibility of one of these four concerns.", "This principle is based on the Functional Data Engineering Paradigm, which is an attempt to bring the functional programming paradigm to the data engineering discipline.", "Implementing functional data pipelines is based on defining data processes on top of pure tasks. According to Maxime Beauchemin:", "\u201cA pure task should be deterministic and idempotent, meaning that it will produce the same result every time it runs or re-runs\u201d", "So, any extraction, transformation, or loading process should follow the standards of a pure task \u2014 check this post for more information.", "This principle is based on implementing a staging area on your data pipeline where data should be, ideally, stored in its original form \u2014 or close to its original form.", "We want to make our sources immutable, so data reproducibility can be ensured. According to Maxime Beauchemin, the immutable staging area principle is key to reproducibility, since, in theory, it ensures is possible to recompute the state of the entire data warehouse from scratch.", "Data pipeline architecture was designed based on the division of concerns stated by Siva Raghupathy: collect, store, process/analyze, and consume. The problem of building a decoupled data pipeline is that it can be complex to orchestrate, so in this way, we added this process as an additional concern to keep in mind when setting up the data pipeline architecture.", "We present how these five concerns shape our data pipeline architecture in the next image.", "The data pipeline architecture addresses concerns stated above in this way:", "Finally, the functional data engineering paradigm is implemented in the whole data pipeline. We ensure that all data processes \u2014 e.g., data loads and data transformations \u2014 are defined on top of pure tasks. So, in this way, we ensure that they are deterministic and idempotent \u2014 check this post for more information.", "We aim the information presented in this post allows you to simplify the data warehousing process.", "Particularly, we believe these basic architectural principles can help people to get started in their process. However, keep in mind the information presented in this post is a simplification of a part of the whole data warehousing theory.", "If you want to go deeper into the theory of data warehousing, don\u2019t forget to check The Data Warehouse Toolkit by Ralph Kimball. This is book is one of the most recognized books about data warehousing.", "Furthermore, here you can find some references that can help to understand some things that are out of the scope of this post:", "We hope you find useful this information.", "Thanks for reading until the end.", "See you in the next post!", "If you want to stay updated with my work, please join my newsletter!
