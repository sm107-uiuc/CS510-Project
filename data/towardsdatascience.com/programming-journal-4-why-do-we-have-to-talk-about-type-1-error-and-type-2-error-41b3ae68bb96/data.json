These concepts are normally being introduced when we study hypothesis testing. It is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics. However, everyone should understand this because it is also critical when we want to evaluate which model to use for better business decision making. And I want to show you why.", "Because it is a bit dull to explain the straightforward concept, I am going to use an analogy here to add some juice in there so that you will never forget this concept \ud83e\udd13", "Think about your boyfriend/girlfriend/imaginary partner. In a relationship, we know there are different types of lies. One type of it is white lies, which means you ask for a piece of information, but your partner tells you something that is not true because he/she wants to make you feel better. The other type of lies is hiding information. You ask for a piece of information but your partner just denies it.", "For this analogy, you can think of algorithms as lie detectors. Some algorithms are better at detecting one type of lie, compare to the other type. And we need to know which type of lie such algorithm is good at detecting. Why? because different types of lies or the same type of lies, under different situations, come with different costs.", "For example, for white lies, the cost of not knowing the lie of \u201cI love your cooking\u201d and the lie of \u201cI love you\u201d is completely different (of course for the liar, the consequences of being found out are also very different for the two lies). So in the second situation, you would want to use the algorithm that can detect white lies the best! Because this lie would cost you a lot.", "The same for hiding information. Your partner hiding the fact that he/she ate a bacon-mac-and-cheese burger while you two promised to go on diet together has a different cost from hiding the fact that he/she is seeing another person a.k.a cheating on you. So to detect this, you want to pick an algorithm that is specifically sensitive to this type of lie.", "In a model, we have predicted values (the values that our model gave us) and the actual values (or the observed values, the values that we observed from reality). The most straight forward way to measure how good our model is is to see how many times they were right about the actual values. When the actual value is true, we want our prediction to say true, and when it is false, we want our prediction to say false. Thus, there are two types of accurate answers and there are two ways a model can make a mistake.", "For terms like False Positive, True Negative, etc, if you find them confusing to remember, think about it this way: if it was a wrong prediction, then the term will start with \u201cFalse\u201d and if it was the right prediction, it starts with \u201cTrue\u201d.", "Connecting to our lying-in-a-relationship analogy, I\u2019d like to think about \u201cFalse Negative\u201d as denying facts because it is denying, and \u201cFalse Positive\u201d as white lies because the person proactively gives me a new piece of information.", "The reason is the same, it is because the cost associated with each type of error is different in different situations.", "For example, last week, I talked about how you can use logistic regression to predict which customers are more likely to move down the funnel so that you can focus your energy on targeting the most likely ones. Our logistic regression has 98% accuracy and we have 1000 potential customers. Thus, 200 customers would have the wrong classifications, in other words, our model \u201clied\u201d to us.", "Let\u2019s say we have some marketing materials to mail to our potential customers and we only send to the ones who we want to focus on targeting because each material costs us $100 to make. Thus, if all the 200 customers never interested in us but our model told us they will (False Positive: telling a lie to make us feel better) and we mailed the materials to them, then the cost for the company would be $20,000. On the other hand, if all the 200 misclassified customers were False Negative (hiding information from us), in other words, we didn\u2019t take any action on the ones that would have been interested in us, the financial cost would be $0.", "Nonetheless, though one costs more financially, it still doesn\u2019t make one better than the other for certain. I try to emphasize the importance of the situation again and again because very often costs are not just numerically, we also have opportunity costs and other hidden costs. For example, your consideration should be different if you were a B2B company compare to a B2C company because each deal size might be different so a loss of $20,000 means something differently; or it might be for your company, it is extremely hard to get customers to be interested in the first place, or it might be you normally only have 50 customers per year, or it might be the success rate of each funnel is different, etc., etc.", "If you google Type-1 and Type-2 error, many materials use cancer detection to demonstrate why it makes a difference to know the type. The emphasis of that example is to show the different costs associated with the different types. To be explicit, the cost of treating a healthy patient vs. the cost of not realizing someone had cancer. Here, I want to emphasize how in a different situation, even the same type of error has a different impact.", "The point here is, remember that the same type of lie has a very different cost in a different situation. It is the same in business. The same type of error will cost differently for different types of businesses, not to mention different types of errors.", "So next time, when your Data Team presents you with a model and the accuracy, ask them, which type of error is this model more sensitive toward? Then, understand the associated cost with your business problem before you pick a model!", "A weekly update from my side:", "I picked this topic to write about this week because I was spending time mostly on model evaluation, selection, and feature engineering. I realized that the position of Data Engineer requires a very thorough understanding of business and the business problem that the company is trying to tackle. I also started to wonder in the workplace, where many companies separate the position of data collectors (other departments), data engineers, and data scientists, how easily this setting can cause problems.", "I was also working on the Customer Churn rate project I mentioned in the last week\u2019s post. I am hoping in the following post, I can finish the project and uses it as a real example to demonstrate how two models can have the same accuracy but have a very different impact on a business because of different types of error.", "On the non-technical side. I applied for some jobs. And I realized that the cause of my anxiety and lack of confidence, which directly impact my productivity was due to the lack of experience in this field.", "For example, I was not sure if the technical skills that I have now are enough to start working as a data analyst or data engineering; am I competitive at all compare to other candidates? Can I spend more time preparing, self-studying, and doing projects and directly start as a data scientist? All the lack of knowledge made me uneasy because I felt that I am not being targeted enough.", "So, I decided to reach out to people and find the answers rather than sitting around and using my imagination to calm myself down. I summarized my top three questions and I ranked their priorities. I am also opening to general talks so that I can get to know the ecosystem of the whole field better and have an idea on my career progression path. You can see the screenshot below.", "I colored each question so that on my other pages where I listed the people who I plan to reach out to, I can put different colors besides their names. Thus, it would be easy for me to identify which color is lacking.", "I first started finding people through LinkedIn via my school\u2019s alumni network. However, because my school is a business school, the numbers of people who fit my profile were very limited. And guess what I did? I started to filter people through Toward Data Science haha.", "I conclude that people who write on TDS are more likely to be someone who likes sharing and it will give me a better chance of meeting people who entered the field unconventionally. And I have confirmed two calls in this coming week!", "I feel truly grateful for the fact that I have strangers helping me out. I can\u2019t wait for the day to come when I am the one who\u2019s giving help to others!", "Best wishes to May! Hope this month everything will get better :)", "Your home for data science.
