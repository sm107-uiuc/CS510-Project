In the 21st century, AI is used to augment industries such as business, education, construction, healthcare, transportation, etc. It is used to save lives, create next-generation technology and mainly to make our lives better. The applications of AI seems to be endless. Though it might seem that AI is a futuristic sci-fi technology that is ahead of our times, it\u2019s not stopping at personalizing your social media experience or automating monotonous tasks. If you think this is the pinnacle of the AI revolution, think again because the AI you see today is just the tip of the iceberg.", "Before we get into that, here\u2019s a little crash course on Artificial Intelligence, is simply defined as the ability for a machine to think and learn. The AI used today is called Narrow AI, narrow in the sense that it can only do a specific task as it was programmed to do and nothing else. The next \u201clevel\u201d of AI is Strong AI or the term used in the title of this article \u2014 Artificial General Intelligence. Strong AI is a hypothetical brain of a machine that has the intellectual capacity to perform tasks and understand speech at a cognitive level that is homogeneous to the human brain. In other words, a robot that can feel things the way we do, fall in love and do basically what we humans can do each day, a feat which is close to impossible for a Narrow AI system.", "This hypothetical AGI is monumental and could change the course of history. This is why investors are feeding companies millions of dollars and experts are working hard in hopes of turning this fictitious technology into reality. According to a report from Mind Commerce, investment in AGI is forecast to reach $50 billion by 2023.", "Speaking of investments, there are dozens of tech companies out there having a group of experts working on this very technology. Big Tech companies such as IBM and Baidu may be making quantum-leaps in artificial intelligence. However, there are four notable companies that are ahead of the race to the finish line of Artificial Intelligence. And the prize isn\u2019t a golden trophy, it\u2019s the holy grail of AI \u2014 Super Intelligence.", "Here is a brief look into each of them.", "Started in: 2015Based in: San Francisco, CaliforniaMission: Ensure that Artificial General Intelligence benefits all of humanity Goal: Be the first to create AGI, not for the purpose of domination of profit, but for the safety of society and to be distributed to the world equally. Founder(s): Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others. Investors: Microsoft \u2014 $1 billionRecent achievement: Created Open AI Five, a team of 5 AI bots that defeated the world\u2019s Dota 2 champions and a robot hand capable of solving a Rubik\u2019s cube.

Methodology to AGI: Unsupervised and self-supervised learning.", "Artificial General Intelligence is surely going to cause a disruption in our society. Its impact on our world will span across each and every industry, and we have to be prepared when that day comes. Even though AGI seems to be portrayed as dangerous and violent, the real danger comes from us.", "We, humans, are imperfect, and we tend to be ignorant of the consequences of our actions. Just look at how we are dealing with the existential risk of climate change, many parts of the world are already suffering from it but we are still in apathy. With AGI, a technology that has the power to end the human race, we are playing God and we have to be very careful in our actions. The risks are enormous and our race is at stake.", "To ensure that this technology will be used for good and not be misused in any way, rules have to be set in place to ensure AGI systems are 100% safe and the sentient AGI themselves will have humanistic values such as integrity and morality that will prevent them from harming humans.", "As long as the people involved in advancing AGI are responsible and are aware of the dangers of AGI, safe and efficient AGI systems can be created.", "Now that you\u2019re aware of the impact AGI will bring, try to learn about Artificial Intelligence and think of ways to apply it in your life. Having the skills and ability to apply AI into the real world will be crucial, whether you\u2019re just a college student or a CEO of a big retail company.", "If you\u2019re an enthusiast in AI, you can start by learning programming languages popular for AI. I recommend starting with Python as you can proceed to learn PyTorch which is a popular machine learning framework or you can learn JavaScript for TensorFlow, which is also a machine learning library.", "If you\u2019re a business manager and you want to see AI making a change in your company, start investing in AI by hiring Machine Learning engineers or Data Scientists. With AI in your business, you can increase sales, enhance customer experience, automate processes, do predictive analysis, detect fraud, and so much more.", "If you\u2019re a youngster dreaming of making a change in the world, with the goal of becoming an entrepreneur, I urge you to start with AI. Find your passion or a problem you want to solve and try to add the element of AI into it. For example, if you dream of designing a new clothing brand, why not make AI design it for you? Or if you want to help find the cure to brain diseases or cancer, use AI to find the novel cure.", "All in all, AI is not and should not be limited to the rich, its for all to experience with and be a part of the revolution in making the world a better place. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment and use AI to achieve the impossible.", "Thanks for reading and I hope you got an idea of what Artificial Intelligence is and which companies are leading in making it a reality.", "Here is a quote by Eliezer Yudkowsky, an American artificial intelligence researcher and writer:", "\u201cAnything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence \u2014 in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement \u2014 wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world.
