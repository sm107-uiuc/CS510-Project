Using absorbance units from NIR spectroscopy we predict the API level in the tablet. The API concentration in a tablet can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0. We apply PLS (Partial Least Square) and SVR (Support Vector Regressor) for the prediction of API level.", "NOTE: The metrics can be used to compare multiple models or one model with different models", "We can understand the bias in prediction between two models using the arithmetic mean of the predicted values.", "For example, The mean of predicted values of 0.5 API is calculated by taking the sum of the predicted values for 0.5 API divided by the total number of samples having 0.5 API.", "In Fig.1, We can understand how PLS and SVR have performed wrt mean. SVR predicted 0.0 API much better than PLS, whereas, PLS predicted 3.0 API better than SVR. We can choose the models based on the interest of the API level.", "Disadvantage: Mean is affected by outliers. Use Median when you have outliers in your predicted values", "The standard deviation (SD) is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set,. In contrast, a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a broader range. The SD of predicted values helps in understanding the dispersion of values in different models.", "In Fig.2, The dispersion of predicted values is less in SVR compared to PLS. So, SVR performs better when we consider the SD metrics.", "The range of the prediction is the maximum and minimum value in the predicted values. Even range helps us to understand the dispersion between models.", "R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that\u2019s explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. Whereas correlation explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable, R-squared explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable. So, if the R2 of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model\u2019s inputs.", "Disadvantage: R2 doesn\u2019t consider overfitting. For more details.", "There is a saying that apples shouldn\u2019t be compared with oranges or in other words, don\u2019t compare two items or group of items that are practically incomparable. But the lack of comparability can be overcome if the two items or groups are somehow standardized or brought on the same scale. For instance, when comparing the variances of two groups that are overall very different, such as the variance in the size of bluefin tuna and blue whales, the coefficient of variation (CV) is the method of choice: the CV simply represents the variance of each group standardized by its group mean", "The coefficient of variation (CV), also known as relative standard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It helps us in understanding how the spread is the data in two different tests", "Standard deviation is the most common measure of variability for a single data set. But why do we need yet another measure, such as the coefficient of variation? Well, comparing the standard deviations of two different data sets is meaningless, but comparing coefficients of variation is not.", "For example, If we consider two different data;", "Let us calculate CV for both datasets", "We can conclude Data 1 is more spread out than Data 2", "The relative squared error (RSE) is relative to what it would have been if a simple predictor had been used. More specifically, this simple predictor is just the average of the actual values. Thus, the relative squared error takes the total squared error and normalizes it by dividing by the total squared error of the simple predictor. It can be compared between models whose errors are measured in the different units.", "Mathematically, the relative squared error, Ei of an individual model i is evaluated by the equation:", "where P(ij) is the value predicted by the individual model i for record j (out of n records); Tj is the target value for record j, and Tbar is given by the formula:", "For a perfect fit, the numerator is equal to 0 and Ei = 0. So, the Ei index ranges from 0 to infinity, with 0 correspondings to the ideal.", "In statistics, mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. Examples of Y versus X include comparisons of predicted versus observed, subsequent time versus initial time, and one technique of measurement versus an alternative technique of measurement. It has the same unit as the original data, and it can only be compared between models whose errors are measured in the same units. It is usually similar in magnitude to RMSE, but slightly smaller. MAE is calculated as:", "It is thus an arithmetic average of the absolute errors, where yi is the prediction and xi the actual value. Note that alternative formulations may include relative frequencies as weight factors. The mean absolute error uses the same scale as the data being measured. This is known as a scale-dependent accuracy measure and, therefore cannot be used to make comparisons between series using different scales.", "Note: As you see, all the statistics compare true values to their estimates, but do it in a slightly different way. They all tell you \u201chow far away\u201d are your estimated values from the true value. Sometimes square roots are used and occasionally absolute values \u2014 this is because when using square roots, the extreme values have more influence on the result (see Why to square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation? or on Mathoverflow).", "In MAE and RMSE, you simply look at the \u201caverage difference\u201d between those two values. So you interpret them comparing to the scale of your variable (i.e., MSE of 1 point is a difference of 1 point of actual between predicted and actual).", "In RAE and Relative RSE, you divide those differences by the variation of actual, so they have a scale from 0 to 1, and if you multiply this value by 100, you get similarity in 0\u2013100 scale (i.e. percentage).", "The values of \u2211(MeanofActual \u2014 actual)\u00b2 or \u2211|MeanofActual \u2014 actual| tell you how much actual differs from its mean value \u2014 so you could tell what it is about how much actual differs from itself (compare to variance). Because of that, the measures are named \u201crelative\u201d \u2014 they give you results related to the scale of actual.", "Relative Absolute Error (RAE) is a way to measure the performance of a predictive model. RAE is not to be confused with relative error, which is a general measure of precision or accuracy for instruments like clocks, rulers, or scales. It is expressed as a ratio, comparing a mean error (residual) to errors produced by a trivial or naive model. A good forecasting model will produce a ratio close to zero; A poor model (one that\u2019s worse than the naive model) will produce a ratio greater than one.", "It is very similar to the relative squared error in the sense that it is also relative to a simple predictor, which is just the average of the actual values. In this case, though, the error is just the total absolute error instead of the total squared error.

If the predicted responses are very close to the true responses the RMSE will be small. If the predicted and true responses differ substantially \u2014 at least for some observations \u2014 the RMSE will be large. A value of zero would indicate a perfect fit to the data. Since the RMSE is measured on the same scale, with the same units as y, one can expect 68% of the y values to be within 1 RMSE \u2014 given the data is normally distributed.", "NOTE: RMSE is concerned with deviations from the true value whereas S is concerned with deviations from the mean.", "So calculating the MSE helps to compare different models that are based on the same y observations.
