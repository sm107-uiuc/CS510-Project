The above Venn diagram was originally published by SAS Institute but their diagram showed no overlap between Statistics and Machine learning which as I understand would have been an oversight. I have recreated the diagram to the best of my information and understanding. This Venn diagram puts forth the distinctions and the overlapping of all branches of Data Science so aptly.", "I like to believe that Data Science is now the umbrella term and all the others can be described as the branches of Data Science, each being different and yet so similar to other branches!", "Machine Learning VS Statistical Modeling: This is an age-old question which every data scientist/ML engineer or anyone who has started their journey in these fields encounter. While studying these fields, sometimes Machine learning feels so intertwined with the statistical modeling which makes us wonder as to how we can differentiate between the two or which label will be perfect for which model. Sure, Machine learning has become a buzz word nowadays but this doesn't imply that we start labeling our statistical models as Machine learning models because contrary to the popular belief, THEY ARE DIFFERENT! Let\u2019s learn about the differences in detail.", "The flow of this post will be:", "The field of study interested in the development of computer algorithms to transform data into intelligent action without relying on rule-based programming is known as Machine Learning.", "A statistical model is usually specified as a mathematical relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables. As such, a statistical model is \u201ca formal representation of a theory\u201d.", "Now that the boring wordy definitions are out of our way, let\u2019s dive deeper to understand the differences between these two domains.", "Statistical modeling came into advent centuries before Machine learning came into being around the 1950s when the first ML program \u2014 Samuel\u2019s checker program was introduced.", "All the universities around the world are now launching their Machine learning and AI programs but they are not closing down upon their statistics departments.", "Machine Learning is taught in tandem with computer science departments and standalone AI departments that deal with building predictive algorithms that are capable of becoming \u201cintelligent\u201d on their own by learning to \u201clearn\u201d from the data without any pre-specified rules as mentioned in the definition of ML above.", "Statistical modeling is taught in tandem with the mathematics department which focuses on building models that can first find relationships between different variables and then can predict an event that can be described as a function of other independent variables.", "This is an important point of distinction between the two domains.", "In Statistical modeling, we pay heed to a lot of uncertainty estimates (like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests) and we have to take into account that all of the assumptions have to be satisfied before we can trust the outcome from a particular algorithm. Thus, they have LOW uncertainty tolerance.", "For example: If we have built a linear regression model, we have to check that the following assumptions should be satisfied before we use the outcome of this model:", "Instead, if we have built a logistic model, the following assumptions have to be taken care of:", "In Machine learning algorithms, there are few or no assumptions that need to be taken care of. ML algorithms are far more flexible than statistical models as they don\u2019t have rigid requirements about collinearity, normal distribution of residuals, etc. Thus, they have HIGH uncertainty tolerance.", "Statistical models cannot operate on very large datasets, they require manageable datasets with less number of attributes and a decent number of observations. The number of attributes mostly never goes above 10\u201312 in a statistical model because they are highly prone to Overfitting (performing great on training dataset but floundering badly on unseen data because it has fit really close to the training dataset which is an unwanted scenario)", "Also, Most of the statistical models follow Parametric approach (Example: Linear regression, Logistic regression)", "Machine Learning algorithms are learner algorithms and to learn they need lots and lots of data. thus, they require data with a huge number of attributes and observations. The greater, the better! ML algorithms in a way require Big Data.", "Also, Most of the machine learning models follow Non-parametric approach (K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision trees, Random forest, Gradient boosting methods, SVM, etc.)", "This mainly depends on the factors explained below. We\u2019ll go through the points in theory followed by examples.", "Statistical model should be your go-to-choice if:", "Machine learning may be the better choice if", "For Example: If you work with a credit card company and they want to build a model to track customer attrition then they would most likely prefer a statistical model which will have 10\u201312 predictors which they can interpret and veto according to their business domain knowledge, they won\u2019t appreciate a black box algorithm in this scenario because the need for interpretability drives higher than the accuracy of the prediction.", "On the other hand, if you are working for a client like Netflix and Amazon who want to build powerful recommendation engines, then in this scenario the need for accuracy in results is higher than the interpretability of the model, thus, a Machine learning model will suffice here.", "With this, we reach to the end of this post.", "You can read more about the difference between Data Mining and Machine Learning and the complete details of Top 4 machine learning algorithms in my following posts:", "Watch this space for more on Machine learning, Data Science and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
