The importance of branding! I was not going to write anything about it, but I was triggered when I listened to Ken Jee\u2019s interview on the TDS Team podcast \u2014 and that\u2019s for positive reasons.", "It\u2019s important we make the distinction between what a product, brand, and branding are, so we get a better understanding of the point I am trying to put across.", "\u201cBroadly, a product is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a want or need, including physical goods, services, experiences, events, persons, places, properties, organizations, information, and ideas\u201d (Kotler & Keller, 2015)", "From this definition, we may state that a product is something that is offered for sale, which may be a service or item (or both). There is a cost in manufacturing a product, hence there is a price to acquire a product, but the price that is charged for a product depends on many factors such as, the market, the quality, the marketing, and the segment that the product targets.", "To make this more conceptual, think of water as a product. We all know that water is a free resource which is a necessity for human survival, however, we may refer to it as a product because it has been commercialized since it may be sold.", "Although all water looks the same, not all water is priced the same. The same product could be sold for different prices and people will still purchase a more expensive bottle of water because of something called a brand.", "\u201cA brand is an identifying symbol, mark, logo, name, word, and/or sentence that companies use to distinguish their product from others.\u201d (Source: Investopedia)", "If I say to you \u201cJust Do It\u201d, what do you think of \u2014 Hopefully the answer you said is Nike. The idea or image you have in your mind when you think of certain products or services may be considered as the brand. However, be sure to note that the brand is not just an emotional attribute, instead, it is the combination of physical attributes (e.g. \u201cThe top has a comfortable fit\u201d) and emotional attributes (e.g. \u201cJust do it\u201d) since these factors are triggered when we are exposed to the name, logo, etc.", "This distinction is important as it is much more common for a product to be copied by someone else, but a brand remains unique. For instance, you may have the exact same Data Science skills like me, but you are not me \u2014 and vice versa.", "To summarise what a brand is, we may refer to it as being the gut feeling about something.", "\u201cBranding is the process of communicating a unique selling proposition, or differential, that sets a product or service apart from the competition.\u201d (Source: Small Business)", "In other words, branding is how we give meaning to something by crafting a brand in the mind of the consumer. It serves as a method to help people identify and experience a brand, and provide them with a reason to select their products over another, by clearly defining what a particular brand is and is not.", "In business, the goal of branding is to attract and retain loyal customers and other stakeholders by ensuring the product is delivered in a manner that aligns with what the brand says it does on the cover.", "The objective is to attract and retain loyal customers and other stakeholders by delivering a product that is always aligned with what the brand promises \u2014 in other words, a marketing tool.", "To relate this back to ourselves as a Data Scientist, we may think of the product as our skills. Many people may have the exact same skills as us, but they are not you, hence you provide a different meaning to the product (the skillset) \u2014 i.e. Kurtis makes you want to become indispensable as Data Scientist, whereas (Fill in a name) makes you want to master Deep Learning. The branding aspect may be thought of as how people would identify and experience your brand, for example, you may have heard of Machine Learning Mastery, but you may be less familiar with Jason Brownlee who is the creator of Machine Learning Mastery.", "Now we have the definitions out of the way, the next step is to explain why branding is important in Data Science and for this section, I have 2 key reasons why building a personal brand as a Data Scientist is important in my opinion;", "Ever since I embarked on my job hunt journey, there is one thing I am noticing more than anything\u2026", "The term \u201cData Science\u201d is extremely broad.", "What is regarded as Data Science by one company may be regarded as a Data Analyst by another, Machine Learning Engineer by the next, a Quant, or a Jack of all trades; Wherever you go, the definition of the role of a \u201cData Scientist\u201d may change\u2026 Sometimes, drastically!", "In part, I am now beginning to feel some empathy towards hiring managers, HR Departments, etc, because they are likely receiving tons of beautiful applications every single day which are totally unrelated to what it is they specifically want. Furthermore, let\u2019s not talk about the burden of the person who has to write the job description.", "It may be easy to write the job description of an analyst, but the lines become extremely blurred when you begin to define the qualities that you\u2019d want in a Data Scientist. To some extent, this confusion has even made writing the descriptions of other roles, such as an analyst, more difficult \u2014 I have seen analyst roles that require modelling skills, which may of sparked a virtual riot if the Data Science God\u2019s (just a fictional character, please don\u2019t google it) got a grip of it.", "I highly recommend you read \u201cData Science has become too Vague\u201d by Thomas Nield \u2014 It discusses the evolution of Data Science, and why Thomas believes we should dissolve the term \u201cData Science\u201d and be more specialized. I think he made some really good points.", "\u201cHarvard created a void called \u201cdata science\u201d and everyone raced to fill it. SQL developers, analysts, researchers, quants, statisticians, physicists, biologists, and a myriad of other professionals rebranded themselves as \u201cdata science\u201d professionals.\u201d \u2014 An extract from Data Science has become too Vague, Thomas Nield", "Given the Identity crisis we are facing in the Data Science field, personal branding comes in to alleviate one from the crowd into the \u201cexactly what we were looking for\u201d category.", "For instance, if you are apart of the Data Science community on LinkedIn, you\u2019ve probably heard of Kate Strachnyi. You are never going to look at Kate\u2019s profile and think \u2018Hmmm\u2026 She is exactly who we\u2019ve been looking for to solve our credit card fraud detection problem\u2019 because all she ever talks about is Data Visualisation.", "Now, that is not to say that Kate can\u2019t do modelling (of which I truly do not know), but I sure well know she can build a wicked Dashboard! And a company that is looking for someone to build intricate dashboards will instantly see Kate\u2019s personal branding and know exactly what she is about.", "In the same way, I don\u2019t believe Microsoft will call Andrew Ng to come and build an interactive Dashboard for them because going off his Coursera courses, of which are some of the best courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, he\u2019s probably bloody well good at problem formulation and modelling (as well as other things).", "Essentially, your Personal Branding will clear up the fog around the definition of a Data Scientist because you have already defined where your strengths lay.", "I must say, it is an ego tickle when a PhD Student sends you a direct message telling you of how much your work has inspired them. However, beyond the lovely messages (and the occasional hate mail), the opportunities are endless.", "\u201cWhere there is unlimited upside and very little downside, take the risk!\u201d", "No doubt in the beginning things will be slow. It may take 7, 8, 9 or 10 months to gain traction, but somewhere down the line (even sooner for some really exceptional people), your inbox will be flooded with opportunities and connection request \u2014 I am talking from experience.", "To put things into perspective, I recently was a guest on a podcast (hopefully it would be released in earlier Janurary) and if you told me this would happen at the start of the year, I\u2019d of scoffed at you whilst I failed to interpret the results of a Decision Tree.", "Branding yourself will put you in uncomfortable positions that will force you to grow quicker than if you shy\u2019d away.", "Aside from the opportunities, recall above we stated \u2018a brand remains unique\u2019, and that is because you defined the vision and your values.", "If you think of some of the most successful companies in the world today such as Apple and Nike, who have both reaped the benefits of having a strong brand. They rarely delve into the logistics of a product and what it does. Heck, I can\u2019t tell the difference between the last 6 iPhones but I still got one and many others are still buying their products.", "Your brand, which describes where you are going (your vision) and what you value, is what will attract people to you!", "Admond Lee wrote a great piece that details the upside of creating a personal brand and discusses more in-depth about the success of companies due to their brand\u2014 Why You Should Build Your Personal Brand as A Data Scientist.", "Yoel Zeldes wrote a good blog that serves as a good starting point for building a personal brand \u2014 How to Build Your Personal Brand as a Data Scientist", "Personal branding is important and more people, including companies, are acknowledging the current environment. It is expected of you to have some sort of online footprint that leads back to your work as a \u201cData Scientist\u201d, if you do not have this, then I advise you to begin working on it.", "On that note, I\u2019d recommend you read \u201cThe most Important Data Science Project\u201d", "Thank you for reading to the end.
