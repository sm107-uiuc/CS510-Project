I have either used these the most frequently out of others or have worked with others who have commonly used them as well. There are a few unique tools that are quite beneficial that not everyone may not know about additionally that I will be discussing later on. I will give some use cases for my examples so you can see why these tools and languages are so valuable. I have previously written about some of these tools and languages, so in this article, I will add more information as well as new information.", "Keep on reading if you want to know more about the top tools and languages for Data Scientist, as well as why you should be using them.", "I have used Python the most, with R and SAS programming tied around in second place. Especially in academic settings is where I have used both R and SAS. I also found some good use out of them in my beginning Data Science roles. For SQL, I have used this in about every role for both Data Analytics and Data Science purposes.", "With each role, I see more and more Data Scientists using Python. I think the reason for this growth and focus on one particular language is that this language is scalable in a business, while also prone to more collaboration opportunities.", "For example, when I work with Python, I am more likely to be able to collaborate with not just other Data Scientists, but Machine Learning and Software Engineers as well.", "If I were to use R and SAS, I would most likely have to refactor my code so that it could be interpreted and ingested by a software process and system that already exists in the business. Of course, each company is different, and some prefer R or SAS over Python in their stack. Also important to note is that in most of my interviews, Python code was preferred by the interviewers.", "I have found the most use of this language when practicing Data Science for the first time in an academic and research setting. However, when I was working professionally with R, I had great benefit from its focus on statistics and testing. If you want to work on significance testing, unique visualizations, and A/B testing, then R may be preferred.", "My experience with SAS was similar to that of R. I benefitted from SAS when conducting experiments and significance testing. It also has some incredibly unique and powerful visualizations with summary statistics, like Q-Q plots, residuals, histograms, and Cook\u2019s D.", "SQL is widely used by Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Intelligence Analyst, Software Engineers, and Data Engineers. I highly recommend having a basic understanding of it for your Data Science career. It is similar to Python in that it is a cross-functional method of communicating out metrics for your business.", "For visualization tools in Python, I use these the most. Matplotlib and seaborn go hand-in-hand, while tqdm is a simple way to describe your code loops by showing a progress bar.", "Matplotlib [4] is a useful tool and popular library for creating beneficial visualizations from your data that can even be interactive. I usually incorporate this library when developing charts, plots, and histograms for quick analysis. Sometimes you need to create the visualization for yourself, and not for other people, like stakeholders, so a more complex tool like Tableau is not necessary for these situations.", "If I want to create more visually appealing graphics, I use Seaborn [5]. There are more options with this library, and you can describe your data with more statistical vigor. The graphics made in Seaborn also remind me of some of the SAS graphics that are automatically created when calling certain functions like the diagnostic plots for regression models.", "If you are as curious and obsessed with checking the status of your Python loops as I am, tqdm [6] is for you, too. You can visually see live updates of your progress, so you can know how much time you have before it is done, and can let you know how long you can focus on something else.", "These tools are widely used for good reason. They are essential to Data Scientists who use Python.", "For simple and powerful Machine Learning, sklearn [8] is the way to go \u2014 also known as scikit-learn. Here are some of the highlights of sklearn:", "NumPy [9] is also simple to use and can be utilized for dataframe computation, which is the foundation of a lot of Data Science analysis.", "Common functions of NumPy include, but are not limited to:", "I would say most Data Scientists use pandas because it is at the start of your project where you perform Data Analytics on your data, while the most important part is that you can develop a pandas dataframe. These dataframes are ingested by several other libraries so that you can perform Machine Learning algorithms on them more easily.", "Some useful parts of pandas [10] include, but are not limited to:", "If you use Jupyter Notebooks frequently, you can add nbextensions [12] that make your notebook more organized. In your Jupyter Notebook, you can add nbextenions with the following code:", "Here is what your notebook will look like after you restart your kernel/exit out of your terminal and retype jupyter notebook in your terminal to relaunch it. The above screenshot shows all of the possible extensions that you can add by clicking on them. You will also need to exit out of your notebook and reopen it to see the changes applied. I recommend Codefolding and Codefolding in Editor. Here is an example of what my notebook looks like before the codefolding extension:", "As you can see, this function looks normal, but the following image is after the codefolding is applied.", "But what happens after you click on those arrows? They collapse the function. Now imagine you have a long function or dictionary that is several hundred lines long and you have to scroll up and down, making it stressful to look at your own notebook. This codefolding extension will surely give your notebook a much cleaner look. Here is what the function looks like collapsed:", "I hope this tool was unique. I know the others can be somewhat over discussed, but there are always incoming Data Scientists who may have never heard of any of these tools. But for me, this specific tool was new to me recently even after years of coding in Jupyter Notebook.", "Tableau [17] is also a well-known tool, however, some Data Scientists may only be using custom coding to create their visualizations. Google Data Studio [18] is less commonly used, but it is even easier to use than Tableau and it is free.", "This tool is incredibly useful for especially Data Analysts and Product Managers. It can also be beneficial for Data Scientists who either want to perform exceptionally well-visualized exploratory data analysis, as well as creating dashboards that display your Data Science model metrics.", "Google Data Studio is easy to use and you can start off by connecting a data source, whether that be from a live SQL platform or from a CSV file. Here are some charts I previously made that can serve as an example of what you could possibly create with your own data. The data I used is dummy data. Here are five examples of visualizations that you could make:", "Google Data Studio includes plenty of ways that you can visualize your data whether it is before your model or after your model.", "Here is another group of visualizations that you can make as well:", "Another great feature about using this tool is that you can make it interactive by scrolling over charts and graphs, as well as clicking on dropdown menus within your dashboard. These dashboards are also easy to share and save. As a Data Scientist that can prove to be beneficial when sharing your dashboards with stakeholders who will later on use them by themselves.", "We discussed some top tools and languages for Data Scientists. I hope that you have learned some new things about them if you already use them currently or if they are completely new to you in general. Additionally, I have included some more unique or lesser-known tools like tqdm, Jupyter nbextensions, and Google Data Studio.", "As a Data Scientist, you will encounter various projects that will require a wide set of tools and languages. It is critical that you learn some, and become an expert in others. Your toolkit is what will set you apart from other Data Scientists, as well as make you a more competitive applicant for interviews and a more collaborative employee.", "To summarize, here are the top tools and languages for Data Scientists:", "Thank you for reading! I appreciate your time. Feel free to comment down below and start a discussion on common tools and languages you practice as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. Please see the references as well for quick links to documentation on these Data Science tools.", "[4] Matplotlib 2002\u20132012 John Hunter, Darren Dale, Eric Firing, Michael Droettboom and the Matplotlib development team; 2012\u20132020 The Matplotlib development team.", "Your home for data science.
