Now, we are ready to start the exploratory data analysis.", "Exploratory data analysis consists of analyzing the main characteristics of a data set usually by means of visualization methods and summary statistics. The objective is to understand the data, discover patterns and anomalies, and check assumptions before we perform further evaluations.", "At the beginning of EDA, we want to know as much information as possible about the data, this is when the pandas.DataFrame.info method comes in handy. This method prints a concise summary of the data frame, including the column names and their data types, the number of non-null values, the amount of memory used by the data frame.", "As shown above, the data frame contains 13551 observations and 22 variables.

This makes sense because Saarland is a sparsely populated state with no large cities.", "As shown below, Munich (607) is the city with the most EV charging stations in Germany followed by Hamburg (535) and Berlin (519). Cologne takes fourth place at the ranking; however, it has far fewer charging stations (134).", "In fact, more than 12% of the charging stations in Germany are located in Munich, Hamburg, or Berlin as shown below.", "A charging station can have multiple charging points.

On the other hand, ultra-rapid charging points of 150kW and 350kW are less common; however, you can find more than 450 of them across Germany.", "The following pie plot shows the percentage of charging points according to the power output.", "As you can observe, 78.28% of the charging points in Germany have a charging power of 22kW. Ultra-rapid chargers (350kW) represent only 1.24% of the total charging points, being the maximum charging power installed in Germany.", "Ultra-rapid charging points are those that have a charging power larger than or equal to 300 kW. As we have seen above, there are only three different power outputs which meet this requirement: 300, 320, and 350 kW.", "The following block of code shows that 6 charging points of 300 kW, 10 of 320 kW, and 328 of 350 kW are in operation in Germany, which makes a total of 344 ultra-rapid charging points.", "As we have mentioned before, a charging station can have multiple charging points.

Additionally, we observe that most stations with ultra-rapid chargers were installed in 2019.", "The first EV charging station in Germany was installed in July 2008, and it was not until 10 years later, in March 2018, that the first station with an ultra-rapid charger (>300 kW) was installed.", "First, we use the pandas.DataFrame.groupby function. This function involves some combination of splitting the object, applying a function, and combining the results.", "We obtain a multi-index data frame, since grouping by two columns will give you two indices. We select one column (e.g. operator) as all the columns provide the same information (count). Then, we use the pandas.DataFrame.unstack function. This function pivots the innermost index level to a new column level. The result is a data frame (date_cities) where the columns represent the cities and the rows the commissioning date, being the values the number of charging stations put in operation in a particular year and city. As we want to analyze only the largest cities in Germany, we select the corresponding columns in the data frame (date_cities_10).", "The data frame above contains the number of charging stations put in operation in a particular year and city. As we are interested in the total number of charging stations by city over the years, we have to calculate the cumulative sum, replacing previously null values by 0. Then, we use the plot function to create a multi-line plot where each line represents a city.", "As shown above, the total number of charging stations in K\u00f6ln, Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, D\u00fcsseldorf, Dortmund, Essen, and Leipzig grows slowly over the years. On the contrary, the rate of growth in Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich has become much larger since 2016.", "The best way to analyze geospatial data is by using maps. Folium is a data visualization library that allows generating Leaflet web maps directly from your Python code. First, we need to install it, since the Folium package is not part of the Python Standard Library. To do so, we run the following command in the Windows Terminal:", "After installing and importing Folium, we can generate a map object with the folium.map() function. The location argument allows us to center the map in a specific location (in our case Munich). We can also provide an initial zoom level to zoom the map into the center.", "The map generated is interactive, meaning you can easily zoom in and out.", "The data frame contains the latitude and longitude where the charging stations are located. We can plot circle markers at these locations using the CircleMarker() function.", "The following map shows where charging stations are located across Munich. As you can observe, the charging stations are quite evenly distributed across the city. However, there are more stations in the center of the city than on the outskirts.", "In the image above, you can observe that some markers are more opaque than others, meaning multiple stations are located at the same point (overlapping circle markers).", "As we previously mentioned, a charging station can have multiple charging points. The number of charging points of stations in Munich follows the following distribution:", "We can customize the radius and the color of the marker according to the number of charging points as follows.", "As you can observe, most of the stations have two charging points (purple dots). The stations with 4 charging points (blue dots) are located on the outskirts of Munich.", "The data frame contains one column indicating the type of charging station: (1) normal, or (2) fast. A charging station is considered fast if it has at least 1 charging point with a power output larger than 22kw as shown below.", "In the following map, normal-charging stations are represented with blue markers. On the contrary, fast-charging stations are depicted in red.", "As shown above, most stations are normal, meaning all charging points have a power output lower than 22kW. There are only 10 fast-charging stations in Munich. Arabella Park (and surroundings) is the location with more fast-charging stations (5 in total).", "Now it is your turn!
