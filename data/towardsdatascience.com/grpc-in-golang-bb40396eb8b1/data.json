There are numerous posts online discussing the advantages of gRPC and comparing it with REST, so I am not going to make redundant comments on this point. My understanding is that gRPC inherits the functionality of REST and extended it with faster, lighter and more flexible service. In this post, let\u2019s take a glance of gRPC and implement a simple service using Golang.", "(Note: make sure your GOPATH is correctly set up so that your packages and project will be under GOPATH/src )", "Comparing to traditional REST API, where the client communicates with the server by specifying a bunch of constraints, like sending to a specific url \u2014 localhost/api/v1/hello , localhost/api/v1/doSomething and specifying what kind of operations like PUT, POST, GET, \u2026 I think gRPC in a way abstracts the idea and defines the communication by simply calling functions in which messages are defined in protobuf format.", "With gRPC, client can directly call a function in the server, as you will see later, they actually share the same protobuf file. And a huge advantage from the image above is that server and client written in different languages can communicate with each other easily all based on that they share one protobuf file.", "If you are a bit confused so far about gRPC and protobuf, let\u2019s continue and implement a service and see how protobuf plays the role in the communication. In this post, we are going to implement a simple unary service, that is sending a request and receiving a response, of greeting. The client would send a request of its name and the server will return a string of Hello + client_name .", "Inside protobuf, it defines the services and messages that are available. Open a project with structure:", "So the service keyword defines a service, and rpc defines the functionality of the service. In this example, our helloService provides a Hello function that requires input helloRequest message and output a helloResponse message. If you are familiar with any programming language, we can roughly make the analogy: service => class , rpc => function and message => global variables .", "Go to your terminal and run:", "the --go_out option specifies the output directory of the generated file and also tells that we need to use grpc plugins. The second part is the target file.", "The result gives you a hello.pb.go file. If you look into the file, you will find the magic of gRPC is that all these informations are represented in go specific languages, and if you use other languages, the same protobuf will be represented in other specific language, and this is also why protobuf can cross-communicate between languages.", "The server takes in a request from client and response accordingly.", "In the main function, we register a server and let it listen on address 0.0.0.0:50051 , which is localhost and port 50051 is the port for gRPC connection.", "The function RegisterHelloServiceServer is auto-generated from the protobuf file we just wrote. If you look into the function, you would find that the second argument requires a struct type to implement the service interface \u2014 doing the \u201cactual work\u201d:", "The above code is generated in the hello.pb.go . To implement the server, the struct type needs to implement the function Hello inside the interface.", "Then in the implementation, it takes in the name from request and return a string Hello + name .", "Client sends a request and receives response.", "The code is straight forward, we create a client hellopb.NewHelloServiceClient dialling to port 50051 and send the request through function client.Hello . Note that all these functions are provided in the auto-generated file.", "Now try to understand again what the documentation said:", "In gRPC a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.", "The client.Hello is exactly what described above, as the client can directly call the function on sever side.", "With both server and client ready, let\u2019s run server first and then run client, and you would get result:", "This is the simplest usage of gRPC in golang, and certainly, there are many more other applications, especially that gRPC enables streaming call which allows both client and server communicate with each other in streaming format. Hope this is just a starting point and there are many more to explore.", "Your home for data science.
