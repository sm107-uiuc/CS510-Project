In other words, I will try to de-hype the crowd about the recent development in robotics. Concretely, OpenAI has claimed some pretty amazing results with learning to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube with a robotic hand. Disregarding their powerful advertisement machinery, how amazing are the results actually?", "The amazing result is not solving the Rubik\u2019s cube, obviously. It is the ability to handle the Rubik\u2019s cube with a relatively non-trivial robotic system. We are talking about the Shadow Dexterous E Series Hand:", "Actually the hand is the same hand from last year used to play a bit with this cube:", "So, in the end, we are still talking about rotating cubes.", "The difficulty of controlling the hand is that it has 20 degrees of freedom. Furthermore, holding the Rubik\u2019s cube in one hand and solving it is very difficult, even for a human for that matter (I can imagine though that it is fairly difficult to control 2 robotic hands at the same time though, reasons why will come later).", "There are many obstacles to solving this problem, as estimating the pose of the hand, keeping track of the cube, learning to rotate the cube and so on. The impressive thing is that they were able to do this on a real system based on camera input after training the controlling policy in simulation. In addition, the hand was able to adapt to sudden perturbations, i.e. toy giraffe touching it while rotating the cube.", "In a nutshell, one could cluster their approach into 3 important parts: computer vision (perception), reinforcement learning and domain randomization.", "Reinforcement learning works nicely when you can have controlled experiments. This means that you have a simulation that you can reset, execute fast. If you would try this on a real system\u2026 Well, good luck, maybe you can ask your grand-grand-grand-kids how the learning went, modulo some mild injuries to the robot and/or various objects/people around it because of its random explorative behavior.", "To transfer policies to real systems (assuming that we have a simulation of the system available) we can use domain randomization. It just boils down to applying perturbations to our existing simulations to create more simulations. In this way, we may be able to capture the complexity of the real world.", "This is not a very new idea, it goes a while back, actually, OpenAI used simple perturbations for domain randomization in their previous robotic hand paper, but based on the work of many before them. Alas, here is apparently something novel, \u201cAdaptive Domain Randomization\u201d. What is adaptive about it? Well, they claim they can generate increasingly difficult simulations for the policies by sampling them from a generative distribution that is learned. Alright, that seems logical, generative distributions are the thing in the 21st century and they made it work somehow. Nice, but\u2026", "We set this goal because we believe that successfully training such a robotic hand to do complex manipulation tasks lays the foundation for general-purpose robots. [1]", "Yeah, general-purpose robots\u2026 I wonder if it is reasonable to assume that we have simulations for all the situations that a general purpose robot can encounter. I\u2019ll let you come to your own conclusion, it is a rather philosophical question.", "So, because training would take too much time, they initialized different experiments (instances of simulations) with some kind of good starting policy. They accumulate a lot of data in parallel, which comes from different policies. It is a well known fact in learning theory that if your training data doesn\u2019t reflect the actual data distribution, your model is going to train poorly. For this reason, they employed the DAGGER algorithm for behavioral cloning to efficiently fit the starting policy. Nothing really new here.", "This task required a lot of computing power, let me repeat, a LOT of computing power. Just looking at these numbers makes my head spin. 920x32 CPUs??? All to control this 1 hand on 1 task. Then it makes you wonder\u2026 How much time did it take? Well\u2026", "We\u2019ve been training the Rubik\u2019s Cube policy continuously for several months at this scale while concurrently improving the simulation fidelity, ADR algorithm, tuning hyperparameters, and even changing the network architecture. The cumulative amount of experience over that period used for training on the Rubik\u2019s cube is roughly 13 thousand years, which is on the same order of magnitude as the 40 thousand years used by OpenAI Five [1]", "Well, that is pretty amazing. We need 13 000 years to learn to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube (actually not to solve it from scratch, but to employ a solver to solve it), nice :). Although, granted, main argument defending this kind of compute is that humans had a lot of evolution time, millions of years of evolution. Since we are building these systems, we should be able to speed up their learning by sharing some of our evolutionary experience, i.e. adding adequate priors so that we don\u2019t have to wait for 13000 years for our robot to learn how to mop the floor.", "As a matter of fact, even after all that training:", "Solving the Rubik\u2019s Cube with a robot hand is still not easy. Our method currently solves the Rubik\u2019s Cube 20% of the time when applying a maximally difficult scramble that requires 26 face rotations. For simpler scrambles that require 15 rotations to undo, the success rate is 60%. [1]", "All in all, I think that OpenAI\u2019s contribution is relevant in a sense that it shows how far computing power with some clever engineering can bring us. Actually, under the assumption of infinite computing power you can solve any problems. It is interesting to see what are we achieving with increasing processing power.", "On the other hand, I have to mention that this kind of research is not sustainable, and perhaps crunching so many numbers for solving a Rubik\u2019s cube isn\u2019t justified and is redundant. 13000 years, 64 GPUs, training for several months, these numbers have to go down.", "Your home for data science.
