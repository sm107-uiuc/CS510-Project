There are unicorns like Yuanfudao (k-12 education) and VIPKid (English Learning) based on online video tutoring in China. There is Vedantu in India that is catering to online tutoring. Singapore has a few smaller players like Tenopy serving in the same space.", "Because of the rise in online classes due to COVID-19, a lot of these startups have reported higher signups and some of them picked up big cheques from investors in recent times. Investors have FOMO ( Fear of missing out), hence as soon as they sense that there will be a rise in certain sectors they try to act fast.", "Today we will see a few ideas that could potentially be turned into new startups catering to the rise in online video tutoring/classes.", "In a normal class, there is a teacher who is supervising to see if students are paying attention or not. But in a live video class, it is impossible for a teacher to concentrate on the video feed of every student.", "Hence it is essential to automate the process of identifying distracted students from the video feed using computer vision algorithms and notify the teacher. Then the teacher can warn or send a gentle ping with the touch of a button to all the distracted students.", "Identifying distractions in a video stream is not well researched but there is considerable research done in identifying distracted drivers because of the rise in self-driving cars. Some of the research is directly applicable or applicable with minor modifications to the distraction detection of students in a class.", "You can also detect yawns and fatigue from the video stream to identify non-active listeners.", "Few pointers to distraction detection algorithms:", "Distraction Detection in a video feed", "With the rise in online classes, teachers are faced with a new challenge i.e to prepare presentations and slides to make the class more engaging. Traditionally most of the teachers still use a blackboard to teach. But with an online shift, they have an additional workload to prepare presentations.", "One way to ease their job is to automate the assessment creation part. You can use state-of-the-art Natural language processing algorithms to understand any text (chapter), identify important concepts, and create assessments (MCQs, True or False, Fill-in-the-blanks) automatically from the content.", "Few pointers to my own research on automation of assessments:", "You can also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect bullying in live online chat or identify unclear concepts/topics mentioned in the chat etc. Then the teacher can quickly review and explain unclear concepts again or mute a bully etc", "For curriculum designers and content authors, one of the main challenges is to create content based on certain learning objectives.", "Learning objectives are the expected goals of a curriculum after a student finishes it. In the above image, we can see how we can use AI to generate a new chapter on \u201cThe Nile River\u201d staring with the learning objectives 1) Understanding the importance of Nile River and 2) Understanding Egyptian civilization.", "We can automate the process by generating initial text and images just from the learning objectives given. The curriculum designer can further edit and finalize the content. Using state-of-the-art conditional text generation models in NLP (GPT-2 etc) and image generation models (GANs) achieving this is not impossible anymore. With enough data and research, we can establish a strong baseline.", "Few pointers to research in this field:", "Transformer Language model for controllable text generation", "I launched a very interesting Udemy course titled \u201cQuestion generation using NLP\u201d expanding on some of the techniques discussed in this blog post. If you would like to take a look at it, here is the link.", "Happy NLP exploration and if you loved the content, feel free to find me on Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
