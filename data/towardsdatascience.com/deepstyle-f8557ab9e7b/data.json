Back then, I was slowly getting to know the world of fashion and style: how to dress better and keep up with the modern trend. I started to watch catwalk shows of high fashion luxury brands that even a random person on the street knows. Dior, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermes, Georgio Armani, Cartier, Burberry, and much more. As I watch more, I began to be gradually immersed in the fashion world. The time came when I need to figure out a final project topic for my Computer Vision course, and I figured, why not create a Deep Learning System that will be able to generate good-looking and creative high-fashion clothing? That would be interesting to visualize right?", "And so my teammate and I created DeepStyle.", "In short, DeepStyle is the custom deep learning framework that has the ability to generate high fashion clothing items. It can serve as inspiration for fashion designers and also predict the next trendy items in the fashion industry. DeepStyle takes in trendy fashion images and create new items as a way for effective future trend prediction.", "Our research consists of two parts: building the high luxury fashion database and using AI to generate similar fashion items. For the first part, we will need a reliable source where we can gather all the high luxury fashion images from runways. But other than that, we also want to have a model that can identify the clothing and crop out the rest of the image, because ultimately, it\u2019d be weird if we are generating fake models and audience in the background \ud83d\ude02. After we crop the images to only contain the clothing item itself, then we can feed the images into another model which will be able to generate new clothing items from scratch. Cropping the image is essential to remove noise as much as possible.", "After a brief analysis of the thing we are trying to build, here is a rough framework.", "The first part of DeepStyle contains Faster R-CNN which is a real-time object detection model that has been proven to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy using its Region Proposal Network. You can read about the official paper here for more details. We will train our Faster R-CNN with the DeepFashion Database which is released by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.", "A quick intro to the DeepFashion Database: it is the largest fashion dataset to date, which consists of around 800k diverse fashion images with various backgrounds, angles, lighting conditions, etc. This dataset consists of four benchmarks used for different purposes, and the one we use for our project is the Category and Attribute Prediction benchmark. This benchmark has 289,222 clothing images and each image is annotated by the bounding box coordinates and corresponding clothing categories.", "After training the Faster R-CNN against the DeepFashion database, the network will be able to predict where the clothing piece is, given any test image. Here is where the Pinterest database comes in. We can build a scraper to scrape the high fashion runways of several large luxury brands from Pinterest and use those as test images for our Faster R-CNN. The reason why we chose Pinterest is because Pinterest provides a lot of clean and high-quality images and also is easy to scrape.", "After inference, the bounding boxes of the Pinterest images will be predicted and the rest of the image can be cropped out since we only need the specific item. We then finally pass it to our Fashion GAN, which will be implemented using DCGAN or Deep-Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. Another quick tutorial for GAN: A Generative Adversial Network basically contains two main components: the generator and the discriminator. The generator works hard to create images that look real while the discriminator tries to distinguish real images from fake images. Over time during training, the generator becomes better at generating real images while the discriminator becomes better at figuring what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake. The final equilibrium is reached when discriminator can no longer figure out whether the images produced by the generator is real or fake.", "The final result is the set of images produced by the DCGAN. And hopefully, they will look high fashion!", "To implement the Faster R-CNN, we are going to use the Detectron library provided by Facebook AI. The Detectron library contains code for implementing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, like Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Retina-Net, etc. The official library can be installed via the following steps:", "Install Caffe2, depending on your CUDA version", "2. For Caffe2 with CUDA 8 and CuDNN 7 support:", "After installing Caffe2, now go ahead and install the COCO API.", "Now, you can download the official repo and install Detectron.", "You can install Python dependencies by:", "You can verify that Detectron has been successfully installed by:", "For more installation details, you can refer to here.", "Note: Facebook AI recently released Detectron 2, which is the updated version of Detectron. I used Detectron back when I was working on the project, you can look into Detectron 2 if you\u2019d like.", "Next, we want to download the DeepFashion Dataset. You can read more about the dataset specifics from their main page. You can download the datasets from their google drive. The one we want is the Category and Attribute Prediction Benchmark which can be downloaded from here.", "In order to train a model using a custom dataset using Detectron, we will have to first convert the dataset into COCO format. COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, but also a standard format for object detection datasets. We can convert the DeepFashion Dataset into COCO format using the following code:", "COCO basically saves the outline of a dataset in a .json file that includes basic information about the object detection dataset. The most notable thing to note is the coco_dict['images'] and coco_dict['annotations'] that tells info about images and their corresponding annotations, respectively.", "After successfully converting the dataset into COCO format, we can finally train our Faster R-CNN model! Before that, we need to first choose the specific variant of the Faster R-CNN we want to use. There are plenty of end-to-end Faster R-CNN variants for us to choose from:", "Back then, I trained three different variants: R-50-FPN_1x, R-101-FPN_1x, and X-101\u201332x8d-FPN_1x. However, for simple illustration purposes, I will just show you how to train R-50-FPN as the steps are the same. You can get a list of the models Detectron support by accessing here.", "After we\u2019ve settled on using Faster R-CNN R-50-FPN_1x, we can head over to configs/12_2017_baselines/ to view the existing model configurations provided. We can find the one we want \u2014 which is named e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN_1x.yaml . There you can see and modify the model and training configuration according to our wish.", "Most important thing is to change the training and testing datasets to our DeepFashion dataset, which is already in COCO format. We can also change the solver parameters to those that we want. Mine looks like this:", "After we finish selecting our model as well as its configuration, now we are finally ready to start training this model! Depending on how many GPUs you have, you can start training by executing:", "After running either one of the commands above, the model specified as the --cfg will start training. The output which includes the model parameters, validation set detections, etc. will be saved under /tmp/detectron-output . For more training details, you can refer to here.", "Note: Because of copyright issues, the images above are not actually items in the Pinterest database but just for reference of what the items generally look like.", "Before we test how well our Faster R-CNN is at locating the clothing items, we need to first have our own test database. We can build a scraper that can scrape fashion runway images from Pinterest. Back then, we searched up the fashion shows from Fall and Spring 2017, 2018, and 2019. The list of brands we scraped included: Burberry, Chanel, Chloe, Dior, Givenchy, Gucci, Hermes, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Prada, Versace, Yves Saint Laurent. We ultimately scraped a total of 10,095 number of fashion images scattered across all those brands.", "As much as I\u2019d like to give out the scraper code for Pinterest, I don\u2019t have the code anymore :(. Since I no longer have access to the virtual machine where we used for this project back then. However, the scraper can be built easily with BeautifulSoup as Pinterest images are all static, and not dynamically generated using Javascript.", "Congrats on making this far! The next step would be to run our Faster R-CNN on the Pinterest Database. And after that, we can start building a DCGAN that will be able to take the clothing images and generate something nice and similar to them. Because this article is already pretty long, we will leave that for Part 2.", "Your home for data science.
