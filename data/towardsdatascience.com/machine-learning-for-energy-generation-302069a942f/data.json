It accounts for up to 25% of the cost per kWh. And fixing problems after they occur can be even more expensive.", "Machine learning can help you get ahead of this problem, reducing maintenance costs by catching problems before the turbine malfunctions. This is particularly important when wind farms are located in hard-to-access places, such as the middle of the ocean, which makes repair costs even higher.", "Real-time data gathered with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) can help identify possible malfunctions in the system far enough in advance to prevent failure.", "For example, we can use data from sensors found within the turbines \u2014 such as oil, grease, and vibration sensors \u2014 to train machine learning models to identify precursors to failure, such as low levels of lubricant. This method can predict failures up to 60 days in advance.", "Each year, human error accounts for as much as 25% of power plant failures. Along with the loss of up to 30 million megawatt-hours of energy generation annually, this causes service interruptions for customers, or worse \u2014 just think of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. It also means unnecessary costs associated with fixing the error and getting the system back online.", "To combat this, we can use machine learning to support decisions made by control room operators.", "Machine learning provides constant systems monitoring that helps you detect anomalies. We also automatically suggest an action plan to prevent the situation from getting worse. It can even deal with a problem before human intervention becomes necessary.", "This reduces the risk of human error due to distraction, lack of knowledge, or reaction speed \u2014 sometimes control room operators simply can\u2019t move fast enough to stop the problem.", "The sheer volume of data we have at our disposal these days is helping people make better decisions about how they operate businesses. Utilities are no different. The volatile nature of energy prices means that running a generation plant can be more or less profitable depending on something as simple as the time of day.", "But because the utilities market is so fast-paced, it can be hard to manually track all the data required to make these decisions.", "We can use machine learning to help. By feeding historical data on prices and usage into a machine learning algorithm, you can predict the best times to run their plant \u2014 and make more money. Machine learning can find times when usage is high but prices for the raw materials used to produce energy are low. These extremely accurate predictions creates an optimized generation schedule that maximizes profitability.", "Utility providers have a lot of options when it comes to sourcing where they get their energy \u2014 everything from renewables like wind and solar to fossil fuel and nuclear. When it comes time to sell power, these different sources are organized into a merit order based on price. This determines the order in which power from these various sources is sold.", "Because we have access to data from a wide variety of sources, we can use machine learning to analyze both real-time data and historical data. Machine learning algorithms are also better at taking into account all the different factors that influence the price -things like weather, demand, how much energy is available from the various sources, historical usage, etc.- to create an optimized merit order.", "This helps you make more informed decisions about where you\u2019re getting your power. This is especially helpful in markets where there is a lot of renewable energy, such as wind, because it\u2019s hard to guarantee energy availability from these sources.", "This article is part of a 3 part series of Machine Learning Applications in the energy industry:", "Your home for data science.
