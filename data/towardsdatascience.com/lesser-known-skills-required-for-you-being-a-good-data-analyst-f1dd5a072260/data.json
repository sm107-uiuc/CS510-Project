Apart\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["What does a data analyst do?", "A data analyst is someone who scrutinises information using data analysis tools. The meaningful results they pull from the raw data help their employers or clients make important decisions by identifying various facts and trends.", "Over the past five years working on data analytical roles across different industries, I have worked with some data analysts and I started to identify what a good data analyst should equip. Apart from some standard technical skills like SQL and visualization tools, there are some other skills necessary but not considered equally as technical skills.", "When one is asked about soft skills required for a data analyst, common answers are logical thinking, problem-solving skill, or attention to detail. I am not saying they are not important, however, my answer covers some skills that seem no one is mentioning. Below I will list out some uncommon answers based on my five-year experience in this role.", "You may question how could be possible to know the result without performing any analysis. This is true. I am not a psychic. Here I am talking about \u201cguessing\u201d, not telling. To achieve this, you need to know the data and business very well. For example, I worked in a commercial mobile department of a telecom company. Every week I needed to collect all sales records to calculate the weekly performance. As you may expect, the average revenue per each sales record was a steady number. Therefore before performing any analysis I already knew how the result should be.", "To be capable of guessing correctly, you have to know the domain range of attributes, like the age of customers, spending per sales record. This also represents that you need to deeply understand the business behind the data. You should not expect the average age of customers to be 40+ if you work in a social media company, but this can be the case if you work in a bank.", "This is somehow related to attention to detail. But in my point of view, this is a byproduct of the capability that I mentioned above.", "The reason for spotting an anomaly accurately is that you realize the result from your analysis is not even remotely closed to your expectation. If you don't have any guess before the analysis, you don't have a reference to compare and you thus have no idea if your analysis is accurate or not.", "Spotting an anomaly can be also demonstrated on viewing charts. As visualization is more important in a business, we all spend numerous of time building different dashboards for presentation. And since people inevitably make mistakes, spotting an anomaly is required before showing any result to the public.", "It is meaningless to only show one chart on a dashboard. As a result, you can check if all charts are synchronized with others, like ranges of distribution and changes over time/categories. You should not get any conflicting messages from different charts. If so, this is already a red flag on your analysis.", "While presenting conflicting messages is a red flag, showing the same pictures across multiple charts is also a red flag. This can happen when you wrongly group your categories, or wrongly setting parameters in your chart. How to check is based on the type of chart, for example, in a scatter plot you can check the distribution of scatters, any repeating outliners on the same position; in a bar chart you can check the magnitude of each category.", "How to explain your analysis? Tell a story", "It is more than a presentation skill. Storytelling is not only about how to present your analysis, it\u2019s also about how you understand your analysis.", "Stories are strange things. They are difficult to define, yet always contain the same elements: characters, a plot, and a journey. In a good story those three parts need to all be written well.", "Without characters, there is no way for a reader to access the story", "There should be a main theme throughout your analysis, no matter it\u2019s the sales of a company or the profile of customers. Your story should only focus on this character and this character alone. Otherwise, the audience will not follow your analysis and your work will be worthless.", "A story needs to go somewhere, it needs a reason to be a story. Plots can be simple or complex, wide-reaching or a brief snippet; as long as there is a plot.", "It is meaningless and a waste of time if there is no objective in your analysis. As I was told by my former manager, \u201cDon\u2019t do it for show.\u201d You need to know the reason for doing this analysis before any action. This does not only prevent you from derailing towards the goal but also helps you explain the meaning of your analysis.", "The characters progress through the plot, making decisions, and their choices affect what happens next. The story moves forward.", "The audience should receive a message from your analysis so that people can take action (or understand no action is needed). If there is no conclusion, there are two possible reasons: one is that your analysis is not deep enough; two is your analysis does not match with the objective. Either way, your work is not completed.", "Combining all three components, when you present your analysis, you can allow the audience to focus on a particular theme with a current situation that is needed to be solved.", "People often weigh more on technical skills and less on soft skills in data analytical roles. The problem is the number does not speak itself and there is someone to explain. This is what a data analyst also does, not just sitting behind a computer writing codes and playing with Excel or other visualization tools. I hope my sharing helps you equip a more comprehensive background for being a data analyst in 2021. See you next time.", "Your home for data science.
