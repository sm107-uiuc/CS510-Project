This is especially true with non-technical stakeholders, who are less familiar with the challenges of data projects.", "Data sourcing and associated analysis can be particularly time-consuming. Much of this work isn\u2019t visible and can be hard to communicate, hence the data insights iceberg.", "The data insights iceberg is a good way to represent these projects. Where the bulk of the work happens unseen, under the water.", "Fortunately not all of this \u201cunderwater\u201d work is necessary for all data insight projects. Each firm has different levels of data infrastructure and maturity.", "Insights and Analytics projects require a key ingredient. Without this ingredient, the project will fail before even starting. Good quality data.", "However, before even getting to the data, it\u2019s key to understand what the clients/users want.", "Generally, it is difficult for people to articulate what information would be useful for them. What it is they really want. Often this is because they don\u2019t know. They have a feeling they want something like X but until they start to see X they genuinely don\u2019t know.", "Before knowing if you have good quality data, those likely \u201cfluffy\u201d requirements need working back into likely data source systems.", "Next is to source the data from the identified systems. And sourced with real data, not test data. If you show a business user a dashboard with test data the only feedback you\u2019re likely to receive is, \u201cThat number is wrong\u201d.", "Sourcing data can be time-consuming. Without full cooperation from the data providers, it can be very time-consuming.", "Assuming all goes well to source the data, each data set requires analysis and understanding.", "Does the data look correct? Does it match back to the source system? How should it be used? Are there business rules to be aware of? How does it join to other data sources?", "There are many questions about the data and they all require an answer. Understanding the data is important to provide accurate insights.", "These data sources then need joining/blending. This generally means writing ETL processes to map the data appropriately. This also takes time.", "It\u2019s key the data coming out at the end of the joining process is accurate. These ETL outputs form the base for producing the business insights.", "Converting the data into useful business information only really begins once the data steps are complete.", "Insights are often presented in dashboards. These are what the business wants to see; the piece of the iceberg above the waterline.", "Ultimately this is how stakeholders will judge your project.", "Due to all of the work happening below the waterline it can be difficult to manage stakeholder expectations.", "In organisations where the data infrastructure is relatively mature, it is more straightforward to rapidly create insights. Therefore expectations are far simpler to manage.", "If you can start with good data it should be possible to quickly produce insights.", "However, for those organisations with a less mature data infrastructure, it can be more challenging.", "Projects that start needing to source large amounts of data tend to be tricky at the beginning. A significant amount of time will be spent at the base of the iceberg, working below the waterline.", "When the work is less visible to the business stakeholders it becomes more important to manage expectations.", "The best option is to create a matrix showing known data sources. The matrix should:", "This is likely to be the best option of showing progress to senior management in the business. For many stakeholders, a PowerPoint slide is easier to read and understand than showing an ETL workflow!", "Ultimately communication has to be solid within these iceberg projects.", "It is likely not the fault of the developer things are taking longer than expected.
