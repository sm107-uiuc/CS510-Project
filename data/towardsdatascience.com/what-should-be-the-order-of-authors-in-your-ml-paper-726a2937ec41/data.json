Indeed, each needs to estimate the credit everyone else deserves, while preferably not speaking about it out loud because it creates this tension between authors that distracts them from research, and then somehow to silently agree that yes, this order makes sense.", "So I asked the big bosses, people who have hundreds of publications, how they resolve situations like this and from what I obtained it seems everyone has its own ad-hoc approach and there are few things that everyone agrees on. Overall, I still do not have the ultimate methodology on how to assign credit and then to place authors according to the credit they deserve, so if you know one please shoot me a message. But at least I know that I am not the only one who have asked this question and below are the responses to some questions worth asking once and for all.", "It kind of does, but in a confusing manner. Primarily everyone agrees that the first author in ML paper is the most deserving guy, the guy who did most of the work, experiments, figures, tables \u2014 he touched them all, this is his baby. Not only has he done most of the work pre-submission, but also he has responsibility post-acceptance to respond to the emails, fix bugs, and open-source the code. This is unlike other disciplines such as math, where the order is alphabetical and the contributions are hidden unless put in a corresponding section.", "Now things would be easy if there was a single author (ah, the dream), but in reality, there are usually 2,3,5, or 10 other co-authors. So what about them? Well, let\u2019s first handle supervisors aka \u201cguys who paid for the show\u201d. In general, it seems that the last place is a sweet spot and is saved for the supervisor unless you have several supervisors for the paper. So what to do if there are many of them?", "Different options. Some people say that the last one is the supervisor of the first author, some that you should treat them by seniority level, keeping the senior to be the last. For some, this question should be privately discussed between the supervisors, but the bottom-line was that it probably does not matter much for people of such caliber.", "What seems to matter though is the perception of people on the number of authors in the paper. Some say that 2, 5, or 50 people \u2014 it\u2019s all the same, the paper is done and the value is not diluted. And for such people, it actually does not matter if there is some random weirdo who was hanging around and was included in the paper because his jokes were funny and hey, he is a nice guy after all. Contrary, some people believe the fewer authors, the more value everyone gets and 2\u20133\u20134 authors is the optimal number unless there was a large hadron collider built to support some crazy hypothesis. So depending on which camp you are in, left or right, either you think \u201cyeah, let\u2019s invite everyone to the party\u201d and sort by their contributions in the middle or you think \u201cthe world should know it\u2019s our paper\u201d so let\u2019s be very precise on who did what.", "This is again a highly biased opinion, but informally an author of the paper is either a chef (e.g. supervisor) or a worker (e.g. student) and each has its set of responsibilities for which he gets the scores.", "For chefs, the set of responsibilities is to have a clear picture of what should be accomplished, to provide resources, to synchronize the workers, to resolve conflicts, to steer the group in the right direction, etc. Chefs are placed at the end of the list, so while we can compute their credits at each particular case, their positions won\u2019t change much.", "For workers instead, the credit assignment is more subtle. There are experiments, small and big, there are figures, there is text, there are ideas, there are theorems to prove, there is scheduling, and tons of other details. Gosh, it\u2019s hard to be a worker. And it\u2019s hard to estimate what is more important, but here is a little heuristic I use to roughly estimate the credits.", "Model and main experiments = 40%", "Supporting claims and minor experiments = 10%", "Of course, not all papers have a theoretical part, in which case you have more experiments, where the credit is due. And, of course, in other cases, that\u2019s a theorem that rocks in which case experiments just support it. But you get the idea: split the work by buckets, assign the weight to each bucket, and get the sum of the weights as the credit of each co-author.", "Again depending on your camp, you may decide on the threshold to include a co-author to the paper (or have a formal reason to remove that poor guy who was asking too many questions). You scored 20% in total, you are in. You made it to 50% take your first place. But more likely it will be the first author who did close to 80% and the rest will be divided among 5 fans.", "In the end, perhaps the most important thing is that your paper has been accepted and well-cited and for a single paper it probably does not matter much about which position you are. Building a trustworthy group around yourself over time is what is important and it will seamlessly resolve questions like this. So build your network and good luck with your research!", "P.S.
