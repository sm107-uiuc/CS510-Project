The latter expresses the transition amplitude (or propagator) as a weighted sum of all possible spacetime paths of the system from some initial state to some final state. In the context of quantum gravity, the average in the path integral is not over paths in spacetime but over geometries of spacetimes (however, as pointed out in Witten, this description may be invalid at the microscopical level).", "You can see my last article for more details about the sum-over-histories approach to quantum mechanics.", "To establish the correspondence between one-dimensional quantum gravity and quantum field theory (QFT) in four-dimensional spacetime, we first need to understand each of these two ingredients.

The energy-time uncertainty principle states that one cannot determine the energy of quantum states that only exist for brief periods of time. Mathematically this is expressed by:", "In fact, vacuum energy fluctuates violently as illustrated below, allowing the creation of pairs of (particle-antiparticle) virtual particles.", "As a consequence of special relativity, this leads to the possible conversion of energy into mass: new particles can be \u201cborn\u201d, and existing particles can \u201cdisappear\u201d. The problem is that the standard quantum mechanical framework cannot explain this phenomenon, and consequently, needs to be modified. This modified version of quantum mechanics is QFT.", "Furthermore, QFT enables us to explain, among other things, why there are indistinguishable copies of elementary particles in the Universe: particles are merely excitations of quantum fields.", "Quantum fields are rather abstract.

As we just saw, this method is based on the Lagrangian which is relativistically invariant making the path integral also manifestly invariant. Furthermore, the objects inside the integral are classical quantities (this is highly convenient since in this formulation there aren\u2019t annoying non-commutating operators, for example).", "We note that the method involves a shift in perspective when compared to the canonical quantization.

Therefore, integrating over all possible metrics up to diffeomorphisms, in this case, means simply integrating over all possible lengths (which can be interpreted as the proper time). Hence:", "Apart from a factor of 2, this is the standard scalar field propagator for a particle with mass m on Euclidean 4-dimensional space we met before. The usual propagator, therefore, can be expressed as an integral over the one-dimensional quantum gravity manifold.
