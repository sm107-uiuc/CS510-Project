During its conception, engineers encountered serious difficulties because of the massive amount of noise created by the displacement of air ahead of the trains, which can even cause structural damage to several tunnels.", "To address this issue, they turned to an unlikely source, the Kingfisher! This bird has an elongated beak that enables him to dive into the water to hunt with a minimal splash.", "Thus, by redesigning the train in the image of the bird, engineers were able not only to solve the initial issue but also reduce the trains' electricity consumption by 15%, and increase the speed by 10%.", "Using knowledge in Biology as a source of inspiration is also possible in Machine Learning.", "In this article, I will focus on one example: Evolutionary Decision Trees.", "These classifiers use evolutionary algorithms that rely on mechanisms inspired by biological evolution to build more robust and performant decision trees.", "After reading this article, you will learn:", "In order to illustrate the concepts that will be discussed throughout the article, I will rely on a dataset that gathers the results of an airline passenger satisfaction survey. More information about the dataset can be found here.", "The goal is to predict the likelihood that a customer will be satisfied with the airline\u2019s services. Such a study can be crucial from the decision-making perspective of a company. It allows any company providing goods or services to not only define what aspects of its product need to be improved, but also to what extent and how urgently.", "Without further ado, let\u2019s start by reviewing the fundamentals of decision trees.", "Decision Trees refer to a type of classifier that relies on a flow-chart like a tree structure. The underlying model classifies observations by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.", "The graph below provides an example of a Decision Tree. It has been trained on the airline passenger satisfaction survey using Scikit Learn Decision Tree module.", "The Decision Tree shows that for business travels the main factor of customer satisfaction is the online boarding: an easy and efficient online boarding increases the likelihood for customers to be satisfied. It also highlights the importance of the quality of inflight service wifi.", "They have been widely used for classification tasks as they offer numerous advantages:", "Most of the algorithms used to induce a decision tree to rely on a greedy top-down recursive partitioning strategy to grow the tree.", "The source set, which represents the root node of the tree, is split into subsets (children nodes) based on specific rules. The process is repeated on every derived subset until the subset at a node has all the same values of the target variable, or splitting does not add adds any value to the predictions.", "The metrics used to determine the best way to generate the test in nodes and splits varies from an algorithm to another. The most common are the Information gain (or Entropy) and the Gini impurity. They are impurity measures meaning that they are equal to 0 when all the samples of a node belong to the same class and they reach a maximal value when we have a uniform class distribution (i.e. when all the classes of the node have an equal probability). For more information, you can read this article.", "However, this strategy has 2 major drawbacks:", "Several techniques have been proposed to overcome these issues:", "Therefore, it is necessary to explore other alternatives in generating model trees. In this context, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have gained recently a strong interest.", "They perform a robust global search in the space of candidate solutions rather than a local search. As a result, EAs tend to handle better attribute interactions than greedy methods.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how they work.", "Evolutionary algorithms are search heuristics that use mechanisms inspired by the process of natural biological evolution.", "In this paradigm, each \u201cindividual\u201d of a population represents a candidate solution for a given problem. Each individual is evaluated by a fitness value which measures his quality as a solution. Thus, the first population is usually randomly initialized and evolve toward better regions of the search space.", "At each generation, the selection process ensures that the best individuals with a low fitness value have a higher probability to reproduce.", "Moreover, the population undergoes specific by means of operations inspired by genetics, such as:", "This process is iteratively repeated until a stopping criterion is satisfied. The fittest individual represents is chosen as the solution.", "EA-based decision trees bring an interesting alternative to common techniques for the following reasons:", "In Evolutionary Decision Trees, individuals are trees. The first population consists of trees randomly generated.", "Random trees can be generated as follows:", "Starting with a root node and two children, the algorithm decides whether the children are split or the node becomes a terminal node (leaf) with a predefined probability p.", "The goal of a classifier is to obtain the best predictive accuracy for new unlabeled data. Decision trees classifiers have also to control the size of the final tree, as a small tree would lead to underfitting issues and a complex tree to overfitting issues.", "Therefore, it is possible to define a fitness function that balances between these two criteria:", "Several options exist when it comes to select the parents that will be used to create the next generation.", "The most common are the following:", "Note that an individual can be selected multiple times which enables him to spread its genes to more children.", "Crossover children are obtained by combining pairs of parents of the current parent.", "First, two individuals are selected to become parents. Then, a random node is selected in both trees. The new individual (offspring) is thus formed by replacing the sub-tree form the first parent by the one from the second parent.", "Mutations refer to small random choices made in individuals of a population. It is essential in ensuring genetic diversity and enabling the genetic algorithm to search a broader space.", "In the context of Decision Trees, it can be implemented by randomly change an attribute and split the value of a node randomly selected.", "The algorithm is considered as having converged if the fitness of the best individual in the population does not improve during a fixed number of generations.", "In order to limit the computation time if the convergence is slow, the maximum number of generations is set beforehand.", "Evolutionary Decision Trees seems to be very appealing, but what about its performance compared to usual Machine Learning algorithms?", "In order to get a sense of its efficiency, I implemented it and trained on a dataset that contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey.", "The goal is to understand what factors lead to a high level of customer satisfaction.
