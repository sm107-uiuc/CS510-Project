Companies like Netflix and Amazon have surpassed their competitors by building some reliable recommendation systems. But these black box algorithms, are they really interpretable? In a complex field like healthcare, can we rely on such an algorithm to solve some real world healthcare problems? And most importantly, can these systems capture the medical context associated with the available sensitive medical data on customers. The purpose of this article is to de-black box these magical recommendations and look for answers which make logical sense.", "As the need for reliable recommendation systems has increased, there has been a shift from the traditional user-item interaction based system to a deep learning architecture based recommendation system which is capable of extracting patterns from a complex set of input data. Autoencoder is one such unsupervised deep learning technique using encodings to embed the input data in a compressed format and decoding this compressed data into a meaningful representation of the input data. Further, these embeddings are analyzed by a knn algorithm to group similar patients together as neighbors. The similarity index used by knn algorithm to group patients together is based on their individual medical claims history.", "The application of personalized recommendation systems for product recommendations is currently the talking point in the tech industry. But when it comes to healthcare industry, the implications of recommendations could be life changing and clearly the need for an accurate and reliable recommendation is of topmost priority.", "The intuition behind the application of recommendation system in healthcare industry is to have a platform which is capable of recommending medical interventions to health insurance companies to facilitate the screening process for the patients. These intervention recommendations are build using the deep learning architecture of auto-encoders as introduced above.", "The recommendations are constructed over sentences which contain the claims history as well the demographics of patients. These claims appear in form of diagnosis and procedure codes labeled as ICD codes.", "The idea is to group patients based on their similarity in demographics and claims history. A reliable recommendation system can help the insurance companies or the medical providers in reaching out to people in the most effective way.", "Now that we have a well thought out hybrid recommendation system giving us a specific list of intervention recommendations which could help insurance companies target their customers much more efficiently, the question arises that how reliable is the system. Unlike product recommendations, we do not want to play it on the basis of a try and test theory.", "Some might argue that performance metrics such as precision, recall and AUC can validate our recommendation system as a measure for confidence but at the end its just a machine learning algorithm. We need validation at a human level as we are dealing with human emotions here. How can we measure if it is doing a fine job capturing the medical context associated with the data? I used some Natural Language processing techniques to dive deeper into the recommendations of this recommender system", "As discussed in the previous section, evaluating recommendation systems based on performance evaluation metrics is not enough. So I decided to reverse engineer the recommendations and try to understand the approach the ML algorithm follows to give us these magical outputs.", "We do not want our recommendation system to group people just based on the number of times they visit the practioner or how many times they file for a claim. We need medically viable reasons to group people together. Below are some ways I check for the same:", "Step 1: Frequency of Visits or Claims", "While it is a good feature to see how frequently the people file for claims or how often are their hospital visits, but we cannot bin people merely on numbers and statistics. I applied CountVectorizer using the popular sci-kit learn library in python for this check. I find that though counts act as one of the important metric to find similarity in people however there are other pieces to the puzzle as well.", "Frequency check is good to get a sense of the common medical codes associated with the patients. But we need a better approach than just frequency itself as we do not want to give added weight to the claim counts. Therefore, I use the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf) vectorizer to focus on reoccurence of medical codes based on normalized counts. This transformation then is used to analyze the people grouped together to see if our recommendations are able to extract the occurrence of medical codes in context.", "Step 3: Recurrence to Relevance (Topic Modeling)", "Tf-Idf allows us to give more context to the concept of frequency by reducing the noise produced by the mere count of codes/claims. However, there is much more we can draw our attention towards. One of the biggest parameters to validate a machine is its capability to extract relevance from the data. To validate this, I applied topic modeling on the ICD codes we have and note if their distribution in different topics conveys some medically meaningful information about the similarity analysis of patients.", "For topic modeling, I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to statitically distribute ICD codes based on their probability of occurring together. Sci-kit learn and gensim libraries in python were used for LDA. This gave me an opportunity to focus on 10 topics, each having 10 ICD codes. So based on LDA, 100 diagnosis codes were studied and I tried to find how these codes are distributed amongst the people who are grouped together by our recommendation system.", "To my surprise, there were meaningful insights from this analysis. Few topics represented a specific set of ICD codes which follow medically viable semantics. For example, one topic heavily focuses on diagnosis codes related to liver diseases whereas other topic represents codes related to pregnancy. So we know that the machine is able to group these codes based on their medical significance. This is refreshing to see and further I look for the distribution of each topic containing ICD codes for people grouped under the same bracket of similarity. The result gives me mixed feelings as I find some medical relevance in the distribution of diagnosis codes however the sample of closest neighbors is too small for generalization. Further steps would be to have the same approach with added layers of similarity detection techniques and a larger sample of similar people to give more weight to the decoding project.", "The article was written with the aim to describe my approach and mindset in making logical sense of magical numbers/outputs which we love as data scientists . But sometimes we need to take a step back and think about their implication in real world. Hope you all enjoyed the article as much I enjoyed sharing my thoughts and analysis with you.
