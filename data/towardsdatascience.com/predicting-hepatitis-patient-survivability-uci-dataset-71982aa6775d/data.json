The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. [1]", "There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. Types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. [1]", "The majority of hepatitis patients often asymptomatic, often physician diagnoses the disease with laboratory tests such as liver function tests, prothrombin time tests, histology tests, or physical examination of the patients. [2]", "The objective of this project is to create a predictive model which can help the physician to identify the prognosis and survivability of hepatitis patients based on the health features given. Thus, early intervention can be done to prevent the death of patients.", "*Note: Code shown here is a fragment of the full code, you can obtain the full code in my github repositories", "The data set used in this project is the Hepatitis dataset taken from UCI repository. The summary of the dataset is given in Table 1 below:", "As mention in the table above, the dataset consists of 19 features and 1 Class (outcome), which can be categorized into 5 categories as below:", "It is noticed that the class is imbalanced which consist of 26% of the patient die and 74% of the patient alive. Imbalanced data in a classification problem possess a significant challenge in the quality of results obtained through the predictive models.", "There are few missing data in the datasets with the most prominent one on prothrombin time (PROTIME) which has 67 missing data (43%) while the rest of the missing data consist of less than 10% of the whole dataset.", "Training a model with a dataset that has a lot of missing values can drastically impact the machine learning model\u2019s quality. Some algorithms such as KNN assume that all values are numerical and have and hold meaningful value.", "2 Strategies had been adopted to handle the missing data.", "a) Imputation with the mean value for continuous variables", "b) Imputation with most frequent value for categorical variables", "Standardizing the scale is important in a machine learning model, especially with a classifier such as the K nearest neighbor. If a feature\u2019s variance is orders of magnitude more than the variance of other features, that feature might dominate other features in the dataset, which is not something we want happening in our model. In this dataset, a standard scalar of sci-kit learn is adopted to standardize the scale within the dataset.", "As mentioned in section 2.0, the dataset consists of imbalance data class, random splitting of training, and a test set produced an unequally distributed class outcome. It is imbalance as alive patient consist of 71 patient and the dead patient is 22. I applied the SMOTE technique to balance the data using the imblearn library. In the following section, I will then compare the model accuracy with and without a balanced class set.", "Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features. The benefit of performing feature selection is as below:", "\u00b7 Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.", "\u00b7 Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.", "\u00b7 Reduces Training Time: fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.", "\u00b7 Improve interpretation: as model complexity is reduced, it is easier to interpret", "A simple covariance matrix method via the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is adopted for the feature selection method as shown in figure 4 below, it is found that histology has a negative correlation with the class (-0.36), it is then not selected.", "Another feature that been drop is prothrombin time (PROTIME) due to having lots of missing data (43%). Additionally, PROTIME is not an important indication of hepatitis virus survivability but a part of the indication of liver failure clinically. High PROTIME usually indicate the presence of liver damage or cirrhosis and can be check from other LFT such as ALK PHOSPHATE and Bilirubin level.", "In this section, 2 non-parametric (SVM, KNN) and 1 parametric (Naive Bayes) classifier are selected. The reason for selection is in the jupyter notebook.", "The main concept here is I will create an empty data frame which I will then push all the test model evaluation parameter (\u2018accuracy\u2019, \u2019f1', \u2019recall\u2019, \u2019roc_auc\u2019) into the data frame with their types and balanced/imbalance information.", "K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) \u2014 Non-Parametric Classifier", "Support Vector Machine (SVM) \u2014 Non-Parametric Classifier", "I will be comparing both results of the SMOTE-balanced training set and non-SMOTE balanced set to show the effect of balancing data in machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset is relatively small, each classifier is cross-validated with 10-fold cross-validation methods and the mean of the performance score is captured.", "For each machine learning algorithm, we will compare the precision, F1-Score, recall score, and ROC_AUC to get their performances. The result is as below:", "Result obtained from the classifier is shown in table 3, all results are very promising as the obtained accuracies are above 80% with AUC above 90%. The average AUC for SVM is the highest where is cover 97.4% where KNN averaged at 92.9% and Na\u00efve Bayers lowest at 90.9%.", "The accuracy of KNN is the highest which is 92.9% while SVM is at 92.2% and Na\u00efve Bayers is at 81.7%. The KNN classifier had the highest recall at 0.99 while SVM has 0.94 and Na\u00efve Bayers at 0.92.", "Overall performance of SVM and KNN are equally good with SVM having a higher AUC. Na\u00efve Bayers have lower performance with acceptable accuracy, it is however due to the dataset is relatively small, further evaluation is needed if there are changes in the dataset size or features.", "Another interesting point of this project is that classifier trained with balanced data produces a better result than a classifier trained with unbalanced data. A more significant example can be seen in the Na\u00efve Bayers classifier where an unbalanced training set produces a result of 57.1% accuracy while a balanced dataset produces 81.7% accuracy.", "This project is a typical beginner project of the entrance to the world of data science and this is my first individual data science project.

I will not use it clinically\u201d", "\u201cHow can you predict survivability with such few parameters?\u201d", "However, this project gives me an insight into how a domain expert such as Medical professions in the medical domain is valuable in the world of data science. A clinician with data science knowledge will be helpful in knowing what feature is needed, what type of number is the abnormal level or even think of an application suitable for this type of engineering.", "I hope this article (a very long one) can give you some insight into how a data science project is taking part and the importance of balancing the data in your project.", "Thank you, I appreciate your time for reading.", "Your home for data science.
