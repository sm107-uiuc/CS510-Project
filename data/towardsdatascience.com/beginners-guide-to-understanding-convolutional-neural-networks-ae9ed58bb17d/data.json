In this post, I will explain about the different layers that make up a convolutional neural network: convolution layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer.", "A convolution layer transforms the input image in order to extract features from it. In this transformation, the image is convolved with a kernel (or filter).", "A kernel is a small matrix, with its height and width smaller than the image to be convolved. It is also known as a convolution matrix or convolution mask. This kernel slides across the height and width of the image input and dot product of the kernel and the image are computed at every spatial position. The length by which the kernel slides is known as the stride length. In the image below, the input image is of size 5X5, the kernel is of size 3X3 and the stride length is 1. The output image is also referred to as the convolved feature.", "When convolving a coloured image (RGB image) with channels 3, the channel of the filters must be 3 as well. In other words, in convolution, the number of channels in the kernel must be the same as the number of channels in the input image.", "When we want to extract more than one feature from an image using convolution, we can use multiple kernels instead of using just one. In such a case, the size of all the kernels must be the same. The convolved features of the input image the output are stacked one after the other to create an output so that the number of channels is equal to the number of filters used. See the image below for reference.", "An activation function is the last component of the convolutional layer to increase the non-linearity in the output. Generally, ReLu function or Tanh function is used as an activation function in a convolution layer. Here is an image of a simple convolution layer, where a 6X6X3 input image is convolved with two kernels of size 4X4X3 to get a convolved feature of size 3X3X2, to which activation function is applied to get the output, which is also referred to as feature map.", "Pooling layer is used to reduce the size of the input image. In a convolutional neural network, a convolutional layer is usually followed by a pooling layer. Pooling layer is usually added to speed up computation and to make some of the detected features more robust.", "Pooling operation uses kernel and stride as well. In the example image below, 2X2 filter is used for pooling the 4X4 input image of size, with a stride of 2.", "There are different types of pooling. Max pooling and average pooling are the most commonly used pooling method a convolutional neural network.", "Max Pooling: In max pooling, from each patch of a feature map, the maximum value is selected to create a reduced map.", "Average Pooling: In average pooling, from each patch of a feature map, the average value is selected to create a reduced map.", "A fully connected layer is at the end of a convolutional neural network. The features map produced by the earlier layer is flattened to a vector. Then this vector is fed to a fully connected layer so that it captures complex relationships between high-level features. The out of this layer is a one-dimensional feature vector.", "Above is a simple architecture of a convolutional neural network used for binary image classification. This network classifies an input between two different classes. This network takes in RBG image of size 32x32x3 and output is of size two (which is equals to the number of classes for classification). The first layer of this network is a convolution layer with 5x5x3 kernel, the second layer is a max-pooling layer with a kernel size of 2x2, the third layer is a convolution layer with 5x5x3 kernel, the fourth layer is a max-pooling layer with a kernel size of 2x2, the output is flattened to a vector and fed to the last two layers which are both fully connected layers.", "Now, you know what a convolutional neural network is and the different layers that compose a convolutional neural network, which are the convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers.", "Found this post helpful?
