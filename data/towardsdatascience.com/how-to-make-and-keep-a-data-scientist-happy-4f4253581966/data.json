While it did not focus on the Data Science market, a recent study has shown that Millennials have a lower engagement with their company and a higher tendency to job hopping. All in all, businesses strive for Data Scientists but often struggle to keep them happy.", "Is it a phenomenon where no place will ever good enough for too long ? I don\u2019t believe that Data Scientists are especially demanding, but the role involves necessities and challenges that both employers and leaders need to consider while hiring and setting up their way of working.", "As a data scientist myself, I identified 5 parts of my job that I consider crucial for my own satisfaction and happiness. I gathered them into 5 Cs to make them easier to remember. I believe that they are applicable for all data experts participating in data projects, meaning data scientists but also to some extent, data engineers, machine learning engineers & other developers.", "Disclaimer: Obviously, all data scientists or individuals in general are different and will value one aspect more than the other. These aspects were only drawn from my own experiences and the experiences that I might have heard from fellow data scientists. Nonetheless, I really believe that these 5Cs are crucial to create a good starting environment for data scientists to thrive in.", "Do not call Data Science what is NOT Data Science", "I have seen so many opportunities putting up the data science/machine learning flag for attention, hoping to get numerous highly enthusiastic applicants to apply for a position in which the Machine Learning part is a complete mirage. Even though this approach will attract many people in the short term, it will cost a great deal to the company in the long term as they start losing deceived employees they have invested time, training and resources in. As much as Machine Learning can be a very sexy term to see in a job opportunity, it is a tiny aspect of the data world and most experienced data scientists know it. While the terms might appear less glittery, there is nothing wrong with Data Analytics, BI, Data Quality or Python Development positions as long as they are clearly defined as such.", "Keep your assignments clear or ask for help to make them clear(er)", "When setting up a problem statement for a project, I always prefer having too much details and requirements than not enough. How can you satisfy someone without knowing what they need in the first place? I obviously think that I have an idea of what the stakeholders could use, and what could be interesting for the business, but I was surprised several times by demands or requirements that the stakeholders were facing. Having a clear picture helps me deliver the right product and minimize the amount of rework to do and consequently, the amount of frustration to experience. Moreover, if there are doubts on what sort of requirements is needed, stakeholders should feel free to start the discussions with the data science team early, in order for them to set up an accurate problem statement or assignment together.", "Easy communication should be at a priority in the team", "When we think IT, programming, data science, AI, ML, communication skills do not often come to mind as fundamental skills to have. As mentioned earlier, projects start with goal definition, expectations, needs. Lack of transparency or bad communication can be at the heart of team issues and will grow problems faster than you can imagine. Don\u2019t get me wrong, speaking a lot does not mean clear communication. I know it, I\u2019m hyperactive and Southern French. I can speak for 15 minutes while having said absolutely nothing. Nonetheless, I value teams in which I feel free to express a need for help or advice instead of spending 3 hours losing my marbles while cursing at my Python code.", "Honesty and Transparency are key to a strong relationship", "I thought a lot about combining Clarity and Communication together under one of the Cs as they have so much in common. Honesty and Transparency are some of the valuable aspects needed for both good communication and clarity. However, I care so much about the communication aspects of my job that it needs to have its own C. In any case, honest and transparent leadership can have wonderful consequences on a team and its performance. According to a Forbes article about transparent leaders, \u201ctransparency allows relationships to mature faster, as openness can potentially avoid misunderstandings that can fuel unnecessary tension.\u201d", "Find the data translators in your team", "I noticed that in most cases, a few people in a team appreciate the communication aspect of the job more than others. I do not know whether I am more suited than others but I definitely enjoy presenting, discussing, chatting or networking. Recognizing this type of skills in data scientists allows a team or its leader to choose the right person that will be happy to discuss the tasks of organizing meetings with stakeholders or team leaders from other department when they require help.", "Offer challenges for growth and learning opportunities", "I value challenges and complex projects a lot. Even though they can bring a little stress into my life, they allow me to grow at a fast pace, both as a developer and data scientist. In additional, such challenges also allow me to get out of my comfort zone and stretch its boundaries. Complex projects can be a point of vulnerability for a company since they require many hours of work, dedication, often encounter unexpected challenges and might have several dependencies in terms of data and systems. However, complexity might also allow a company to move into a new, different and innovative field, taking their team along for the ride.", "Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. \u2014 T. S. Eliot", "Celebrate differences and diversity in your team", "Next to celebrating gender, age and ethnic differences, I really believe that not every data scientist should have their strength in the same spot. Next to best programmers, I have enjoyed working next to best statisticians, best teachers, best presenters and best \u201cnetworkers\u201d. Recognizing different qualities in different data scientists, experts, engineers allows you to nurture as well as exploit qualities already present in the team instead of focusing solely on weakest points to improve.", "Encourage team work, team gathering and team events.", "In my own experience, a team functions better when people actually appreciate each other\u2019s company (or at least feel a little bit of a connection). They might hesitate less to ask each other for help, and have an easier time keeping honesty and transparency at the heart of their communication. If I was leading a data science team, I would certainly encourage lunch breaks, or even better, I would force lunch breaks for the entire team. I used to skip lunch in the past. I now know that I only did so when I was working in an environment that was not suited for me. Nowadays, my lunch break has become some sort of sacred break and I will be a grumpy ass at anyone who tries to put a meeting during my lunch break (unless they provide free lunch and a very good justification.). I simply feel happy to take a break, enjoy my food and have a chat with the team, even in rushy times.", "\u201cCreativity\u201d sounds like this rare odd word that I seldom hear about in programming and technology. We hear innovation a lot, technical skills, analytical skills but creativity remains an image of art, colors, abstract ideas & music notes that only belongs in concert halls & art galleries. However, I believe that creativity is everywhere in machine learning and is at the heart of the best models that were found.", "Studies have shown that job autonomy has a positive impact on employee satisfaction and happiness. In my opinion, autonomy also represents a prerequisite for creativity and I highly appreciate being given autonomy to solve a problem or answer a question. With AI, data visualization, data processing, feature engineering and even data cleaning, there is often more than one solution possible to a problem statement and the best answer might not always be the most obvious one. Building a machine learning solution with a balance between innovative, reliable, efficient , light and explainable often requires a significant dose for creativity.", "\u201cCreativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way.\u201d- Edward de Bono, inventor of the Lateral Thinking technique", "The world around Data Science remains complex, varied and cannot be covered easily in all its facets, even though I hope to touch the essential requirements I experienced in these 5 aspects. Moreover, applying all five Cs in a business or organization is obviously much more complex than simply taking the decision to do so. Nonetheless, a tiny step in the right direction can be done by keeping the 5 elements in mind with each decision regarding any data science projects, teams or management.", "If you would like to read more articles about improving the environment data scientists work in or how to face challenges in data translation, data science, AI and leadership, follow me on Medium or on Twitter to get notified.", "If you would like to read more stories of mine:", "Your home for data science.
