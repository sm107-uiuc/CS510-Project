In this piece, I will answer the important question of the day: how lazy can I be? How many times can I use any given paper filter for espresso?", "I will look at this statistically over the span of a few months as well as a few precise examples related to the bottom filter.", "Using a paper filter on top can be reused quite a lot, but my machine performs worse with a top filter. For a bottom filter, single use is the best or after the right kind of cleaning. In this case, a second use is massively noticable. For a middle filter, it seems somewhere between 4 and 6 uses it optimal. This is used when doing staccato tamping or staccato espresso.", "I\u2019m putting these definitions here because just after this section, I evaluate different amounts of paper filters using these metrics.", "I used two metrics for evaluating the differences between shots: Final Score and Coffee Extraction.", "Final score is the average of a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste). These scores were subjective, of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots. There is some variation in the scores. My aim was to be consistent for each metric, but some times the granularity was difficult and affected the final score.", "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is measured using a refractometer, and this number is used to determine the percentage of coffee extracted into the cup in combined with the output weight of the shot and the input weight of the coffee, called Extraction Yield (EY).", "I reused my filters because it took time to cut them, and I also don\u2019t like waste if I don\u2019t have to. I also kept note of how old each filter was (i.e. how many times it had been used). So an age of 1 is a new filter. I then looked at some standard metrics of performance.", "There seems to be a slight degradation in taste as represented by Final Score. For EY and TDS, there is a definite drop off after 6 uses or so.", "Age doesn\u2019t affect paper weight, so the amount of solids remaining is very small, but they have an impact.", "There is also an impact on Time to Cover Filter (TCF) and Total Time. TCF is a good indicator of flow, but the variable isn\u2019t quite separated from roast age in this graph.", "I compared TDS and EY in control charts with all the data and then data for new, sort of new, and old.", "There doesn\u2019t seem to be a ton of separation in these graphs. So I went to summarizing the data using an average.", "This data can be summarized, and the trends seem clear based on the averages.", "The preference is to use new filters or appropriately cleaned filters.", "The bottom filter can only be used once. For whatever reason, it can\u2019t be cleaned enough to not jam up. I started using one because of some difficult roasts, and once I discovered this fact, I changed to only use a fresh one. In this test, I used a filter once, rinsed it, let it dry, and reused it again with all other shot parameters the same.", "The differences are especially noticeable in the post-shot puck analysis. Darker spots indicate slow flow due to channeling elsewhere. The top half of the puck is a much lighter tamp, so if it evenly falls apart, that\u2019s usually indicative of more even and better extraction. In this case, that was the first time using the filter. For the second time, the top layer has larger clumps particularly in the middle that indicate not enough extraction occurred.", "We can look at the flow rates of the shots, and it is clear that New vs Used Once has a big difference. The flow rate was much more slowed down. For reference, Pre-infusion was 45 seconds, and the jitter in the flow is due to pressure pulsing.", "When we look at the smoothed flow rate, the peak during Pre-infusion was lower and then it became more constant. The same was true for infusion. The blue line is more typical of what a really good shot looks like.", "The new filter had a higher TDS, EY, and taste. This indicates that something of the coffee remains in the filter even after rinsing that still restricts flow.", "This drove me to wonder what happens when a filter is washed with soap and reused.", "I wanted to see if I could clean paper filters even though many people suggested just to use a new one. My issue with not reusing paper filters comes down to cost, waste, and time. By cleaning them, I could save myself in all three areas because batch cleaning is faster than individual cutting.", "Previously, I had only rinsed the filters. I then tried soap and water, and it was better than reusing a filter. However, it wasn\u2019t as good as using a new filter.", "Then I tried isopropyl alcohol. That seemed to do the trick! The result was so similar to the new filter that it was hard to tell the difference both in taste and extraction yield.", "This study has informed my behavior greatly as it has put numbers to a technique that doesn\u2019t have much understanding. I have now switched to using only new paper filters or isopropyl washed filters, and it has helped me maintain consistency and shot excellence.", "Additionally, while writing up this series of articles, I decided to take another look at cloth filters, and I\u2019ve switched my middle filter to a cloth filter in a staccato tamped shot. This has dramatically changed the flow and the shots, so I\u2019ve also decided to look at other materials for this layer in the middle or on the bottom of the espresso puck. I\u2019m interested in a better shot and technique, but more than that, I\u2019m curious to understand better how everything is functioning inside the puck.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
