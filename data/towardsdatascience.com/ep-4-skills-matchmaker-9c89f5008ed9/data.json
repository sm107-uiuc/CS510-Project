The voice in the back of his head suggested, in turn, that the number of people who had heard exactly the same words probably counts in thousands.", "\u201cThank you,\u201d Domnall answered instinctively. Just in time, he remembered to smile, and he curled his lips ever so slightly.", "\u201cI have the last question,\u201d said the lady on the screen.", "Domnall found it hard to imagine anyone equally emotionally transparent to him. Neither pretty nor ugly, neither stupid nor smart, the woman was so matter-of-fact and easy-going at the same time, so balanced between distance and enthusiasm, and so full of unsurpassed perfection that somewhere in all this there was no space left for personality.", "\u201cCould you please describe the project from your previous work that you are the proudest of and explain how the project added significant value to the company?\u201d", "Domnall stiffened. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t stay in the company long enough to evaluate the results of the project, of which he was the proudest. For a moment, he was tempted to remind the authors of this riddle that project satisfaction and added value do not always have to go hand in hand, but he gave it a rest. Something else worried him; until now all questions were indistinguishable from cross-word definitions with a question mark added. Why suddenly this open form?", "His hesitation had to be noticed because the woman encouraged him once again:", "\u201cIf confidentiality clauses prohibit you from talking about this project, please tell me about one that you can.\u201d", "\u201cThe agreement that I signed on leaving was mainly a long and detailed list of things I mustn\u2019t do,\u201d Domnall focused so much on breaking the embarrassing silence that he put his foot in it. \u201cBut most of them ensured I would not express negative opinions about the company in any form,\u201d he added and immediately reprimanded himself in his thoughts. He was babbling again instead of going to the merits. The recruiter warned him; the message shall be short, clear and to the point! He pulled himself together. \u201cThe situation was as follows; to reduce costs, the company terminated the expensive logistics management system, but unfortunately, they did it before its cheaper replacement was implemented.\u201d", "No, that didn\u2019t sound good either. Such wording not only puts Domnall at risk of a meeting with his former employer\u2019s lawyers but also his interlocutor could categorize him as a malcontent.", "\u201cWhat an interesting project,\u201d the woman interrupted unexpectedly. Her voice was as friendly as before. \u201cWhy do you think the situation was as follows?\u201d", "Domnall was dumbfounded. Did he mishear? This question did not make sense!", "\u201cMy settlement agreement explicitly prohibits me from expressing my opinion about the reasons for the situation my company found itself in,\u201d he answered, just to say something, wondering whether the woman, in her boundless perfection, allows any error reports.", "\u201cSo you don\u2019t have an opinion on that?\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s assume I don\u2019t have one,\u201d Domnall muttered, completely forgetting to smile. The next sentences he spoke slowly, loudly and clearly. \u201cReturning to the project, the obstacles were: information chaos, the multitude of data sources, and quality of data. Actions that I took \u2014 I designed and prepared a prototype of a substitute system. I automated the processing and cleaning of data in relational databases. Where possible, I added predictive elements using various python machine learning libraries.\u201d", "The woman was silent a bit longer than usual.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t notice how this project significantly added to the company\u2019s value\u201d she complained. \u201cCould you rephrase that, please?\u201d", "\u201cI quit my job looking for new opportunities and challenges too soon to know exact results, but if they implemented my system, they could significantly minimize the chaos that costs the company millions of dollars a year.\u201d", "\u201cThank you very much. That was the last question.\u201d If the woman wiped a smile from her lips, her face would express absolute nothing. \u201cAnalyzing your statements, I conclude that you match fourteen out of eighteen required skills. I didn\u2019t notice you have experience with SQL, pandas and scikit-learn libraries, and you lack the ability to communicate opinions precisely.\u201d", "\u201cScikit-learn is one of the python packages!\u201d Domnall snorted. \u201cI used it, as well as the Keras library, and PyTorch. I don\u2019t even mention pandas, as I don\u2019t mention that I use the keyboard! Besides, SQL is a standard for handling the relational databases I did mention. As for communication, it\u2019s difficult to demand my definite opinion, if it is legally forbidden for me to express one!\u201d he burst out and added, \u201cYou can\u2019t evaluate me based solely on keywords!\u201d", "\u201cStatements given after the end of the question session are not taken into account,\u201d said the invariably warm voice of the interviewing program \u2014 the masterpiece of millions of tiny equations optimizing it for professionalism. \u201cWith a score of fourteen points, you are in the sixth-ten of candidates. We will call you.\u201d", "Episode 6: Passionate, more passionate, hired!", "Domnall is a brilliant guy. However, job-seeking is long-term entertainment, and will probably take him a while. Especially that job interviews don\u2019t happen every day. In the meantime, you may consider reading about other (equally brilliant) characters in our #Pharmacon sociological thriller.", "Your home for data science.
