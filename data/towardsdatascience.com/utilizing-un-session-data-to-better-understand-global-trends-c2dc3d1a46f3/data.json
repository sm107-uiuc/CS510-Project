Since it was founded in 1945, the annual UN sessions have served as a platform for pressing global issues to be addressed and as a result has documented major issues and trends over time.", "Through this project, I wanted to explore these global trends over time using a Kaggle data set called \u201cUN General Debates\u201d .", "The data set had a few but meaningful features. Each instance contained the year, the session number, the country speaking, and a transcript of the session. The data set contained session data from 1970 to 2015, a range of 46 years. My first step was to aggregate the sessions per year and generate a text file for each year. I then used Sklearn\u2019s CountVectorizer class to perform Bag of Words and output the top 10 words per year. With this information given, I used Illustrator to generate a visual depictions of the more common words per year.", "I had a few main points in mind for the visual", "I came up with two models:", "Below is the second data visualization, which documents every year instance between 1970 and 2015.", "Some terms appeared consistently throughout the years whereas some appeared only once or twice. Certain terms appeared in the middle of the data set and continued to be present until the very end. In order to highlight these major trends and outliers, I assigned colors to each of these terms to tag them. This way a viewer can visually follow the presence and the shifting popularity of a term over time. Terms that were consistent throughout the data set, were assigned darker colors which offered enough but little contrast against the background (community, rights, development). Terms deemed noteworthy but not too significant were also assigned darker colors (reform, 2015). Terms that emerged in the middle of the data sets timeline and then remained a buzzword, were given slightly brighter color values (global, climate). In addition, terms related to world crises and causes of human suffering were given bright and jarring colors (terrorism, nuclear). Lastly, powerful words that were mentioned only a few times were given bright and pastel colors (millennium, hope). The last two categories were assigned the aforementioned color types so that they stood out the most to a scanning viewer.", "I would like to note some brief points on the subjective choices I made in this data representation.", "Cleaning the Transcripts: While cleaning the transcripts I first removed general English stop words. However upon calculating the top ten words per year, I found that most of the remaining terms in the top ten remained consistent over all 46 years. These terms were all domain specific terms. In order to be able to dig a little deeper into the content of the sessions, I removed many domain specific terms. I would like to note that I did this based on what terms appeared very often but set an arbitrary threshold for which terms were frequent enough to be removed and which were to be kept. Changing the threshold would undoubtedly change the results from Bag of Words. Looking back on the finished work, perhaps a lower threshold to remove words would give a more specific and unique year to year data set. A lower threshold would eliminate terms such as \u2018community\u2019, \u2018rights\u2019, and \u2018development\u2019.", "Some words that were removed: international, nations, united, we, world, peace, countries, people, organization, session, security, economic, government", "Category Assignment: My process for assigning terms categories was very qualitative in nature. Choices like deciding that \u201ccooperation\u201d is relevant and meaningful and \u201csupport\u201d were thought out yet still subjective decisions to make.", "Roots and Parts of Speech: In my current implementation of this project terms like \u201cdeveloping\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d are treated as the same term for simplicity and directness. However, it is important to note that there is meaningful information encrypted in the difference between the two. Equipped with a background in linguistics, one could potentially draw conclusions about the time period based on the sentence structures a noun or verb form of the words suggest (i.e. perhaps frequency of the verb form suggests a likelier chance of taking action).", "While I included this section as interesting data findings, seeing that many of the interesting take aways were in the top 15 shows that perhaps removing some more buzzwords would show a more unique story per year. At the same time, it was interesting to see the evergreen discussions such as human rights and community remain consistently important yet fluctuate in priority on the scale.", "I used Sklearn\u2019s CountVectorizer in generating the top words per year. Perhaps TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) would give more insightful information on year to year trends as it would highlight the anomalies year to year instead of emphasizing the terms that are common throughout all session data.", "I ran a topic generation algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) on the year to year sessions data just to see what the algorithm would output as the number one topic per year.
