Many social media platforms boast of subscribers in the millions. Like they say, with the good\u2026 comes the bad. Along with catching the fancy of genuine subscribers, online social networks have also caught the attention of bad actors. Bots and malicious accounts make up for a significant chunk of the user base. Fortunately, just like real users, fake users also leave trails in data enabling detection of these unwanted and potentially dangerous accounts.", "In this post, I describe different fake user scenarios and how feature based classification techniques are employed in the detection of such users as explained in the research papers.", "Humans in general behave differently from than fake or bot accounts. If this difference in behaviour can be captured in numerical or categorical attributes, then machine learning techniques can be applied to detect real from fake. This is the essence of feature based classification approaches to detect malicious accounts.", "The ML process to detect real or fake status at the account level has 3 components.", "Individual users and groups of users in a network can be described using two categories of features:", "Depending on the time sensitivity of detecting fake users, features engineered can come from one or both of the categories above. If it is crucial to limit the interaction of fake users with real users, approaches using only profile features are useful.", "Research and surveys facilitate better feature design through increased user understanding.", "In an OSN (Online Social Network), there may be a large number of attributes associated with an account \u2014 using all the features may become computationally expensive. There may be redundancy in some of the features or some may not be good predictors of user status.", "Feature selection addresses some of these concerns. Wrapper and Filter methods are commonly used to include the best predictors. A weight is assigned to each attribute and the ones selected are those with weights above a certain threshold.", "Some algorithms that perform well in classification tasks \u2014 Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Neural Network. Weighted attributes determined from the feature selection step can be applied to these algorithms. Metrics commonly used are Precision, Recall and F-score.", "For the data set\u00b9 used, Random Forest algorithm performs well considering F-score and Precision. As features included increase in weight, other algorithms also start performing better. When features with weight above 50% are used, SVM gives the best prediction considering Precision while Naive Bayes performs the best in F-score metric.", "In a large scale OSN, a bad actor can create dozens to thousands of malicious accounts. Making a prediction about each account, as most fake user detection techniques do, may not be scalable or efficient. In such a situation, Cluster level detection is desirable.", "Legitimate clusters of users show diversity in profile patterns whereas groups of fake accounts created by a single actor show similar distribution and frequency of attributes. Hence, engineering features to describe the whole cluster allows for detection of clusters of fake accounts.", "The main difference between methods predicting each user\u2019s status and a group\u2019s status is the level of features \u2014 individual or cluster.", "The Classification based Machine Learning Pipeline that operates on clusters is described next. There are 3 major components.", "This component, takes the raw list of accounts and builds clusters of accounts along with their raw features. There are 3 user specified parameters fed to this module a) minimum and maximum cluster size b) time span of accounts registered (e.g. last 24 hours), and c) clustering criteria (e.g. registration IP address).", "The output of this component is a table of accounts, where each row represents one account and contains features like user\u2019s name, organization, education and cluster identifier unique to the account\u2019s cluster.", "The cluster builder also uses the fake or real status of individual accounts to label clusters as fake or real. A threshold \u2018x\u2019 decides cluster labels \u2014 fewer than x percent fake accounts in the cluster, then it is a real cluster.", "This module converts raw data for each cluster into a single numerical vector representing the cluster. It is implemented as a set of functions that extract information from the raw features. The features could be", "a) Basic distribution features \u2014 Statistical measures for each column. Mean or quartiles for numerical features, number of unique values for categorial features", "b) Pattern features \u2014 Mapping of user-generated text to a categorical space (e.g. patterns in email addresses)", "c) Frequency features \u2014 Frequency of each feature value over all the individual accounts and their distribution over these frequencies. Clusters of legitimate accounts have some high-frequency and some low-frequency data, clusters of malicious accounts however, show less variance in their data frequencies.", "This third component is to train the models and evaluate their performance on previously unseen data. The module is either run in the training mode or evaluation mode. The output is either a model description and evaluation metrics (training mode) or a cluster score (evaluation mode) which is the likelihood of the cluster composed of fake accounts.", "Regression methods considered 1) Logistic Regression with L1 regularization 2) Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function kernel 3) Random Forest", "When prediction performance as measured by AUC and recall at 95% precision is considered, Random Forest performs the best. SVM with RBF kernel also has does well in terms of AUC value, but its recall@p95 is not as good as random forest. Logistic Regression has the worst performance, because it is a linear classifier and cannot model the non-linearity in patterns well.", "User behaviour patterns are rarely fixed, they change and emerge differently over time, often as a response to factors inside and outside of the application. Attackers do the same! They modify their content and activity patterns to evade detection\u00b3. Feature based techniques are vulnerable to this and have to be diversified regularly to keep up with changing patterns.", "High dimensional (very large number of features) data could lead to increased computational costs when using classifiers. This can be somewhat mitigated by using feature reduction techniques like Dimension reduction or Feature subset selection.", "Feature based Classification method is a popular approach to detect bots and other malicious users. It scales well to large OSNs and gives good performance. Graph based techniques also are commonly employed to detect fake users, however feature based methods with profile attributes allow for early detection. There are many classification algorithms to iterate on and tune performance. A combination like SVM \u2014 NN\u00b3 could improve prediction even further. Overall, feature based classification provides a diverse toolbox that could be tweaked and applied to multiple scenarios.", "[1]: Elazab, Ahmed & Mahmood, Mahmood & Hefny, Hesham. (2016).
