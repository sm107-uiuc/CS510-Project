SQL and data go hand in hand, so all data scientist interviews today will go through a technical interview using SQL. There will be exceptions though where they might give you the option of R or Python. However, I can guarantee it is more common that the interview will cover SQL versus any other languages.", "SQL is THE foundational language of data.", "In order to master SQL, I recommend two resources:", "Note: I am not sponsored by either of these resources. I\u2019m budget conscious, so this is why I chose the two resources above. The above will cost you <$30 to get started.", "As you\u2019re getting started, don\u2019t worry too much about the syntax you\u2019re learning with. Not every company uses the same tool for their data, so my recommendation is that you learn the basic concepts and the interviewers will usually let is pass. For example, at Microsoft, I use three internal variations of SQL, and they are all different in syntax\u2026", "In this section, I want to cover the SQL checklist that most data scientist interviewers will expect from you. I won\u2019t be going through everything SQL has to offer, but rather, I will cover the most important topics and try to point you to the right resources for the topics I don\u2019t cover.", "Note: I will be using SQL Server syntax here because it is the closest to the syntax I use.", "When you are exploring any tables, you should always check the first N rows in order to understand the schema of the table. You can do this using TOP.", "In order to do quick checks and save processing time, you want to just pull few rows in order to get enough information about the schema in order to specify your SQL code.", "Before retrieving the columns you\u2019ve stated, the WHERE clause will make sure to filter out all the columns you need. Make sure to do this before executing your SQL query because it takes a lot of computing power to process big data. Often, this computing power costs money and it is shared amongst the data team, so you need to pay attention to the WHERE clause in the SQL code to make sure you\u2019re not retrieving any unnecessary rows of data.", "Go ahead and practice here. You should focus on the following sections to really understand how you can leverage the WHERE clause.", "Important: WHERE clauses don\u2019t accept aggregates, scalar subqueries, windowing functions and aliases [1]", "Data is not as clean as you think. It\u2019s often dirty and you will be cleaning it before getting the data you want. One of the most common challenges will be dealing with NULL columns. Before applying any SQL function, you have to first understand how to handle them and how they might effect your query. Check this link out to learn more about them.", "There are many nuances with NULL values when it comes to querying them (differs by the tools you\u2019re using as well), so a lot of the times, you will try to replace them with a value that is more informative/helpful. COALESCE is a great function that SQL has to handle null values. If you notice there might be a lot of NULL values in the column and want to provide another value if it\u2019s null, COALESCE is the function to use.", "If you want to use a logical statement in your SQL, CASE statements are probably what most database querying language syntax will use. Learn how to use them, and practice using them here. This is probably one of the most commonly used function in SQL. Mode.com does a fantastic job of explaining this and also provides you options to practice: https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-case/", "COUNT, SUM, MIN/MAX, and AVG are probably the most commonly used aggregation function. Practice using them, and understand how they work. I\u2019m going to refer you to Mode.com again, but here are some few helpful tips to be aware of:", "If you\u2019re dealing with big data, you\u2019re going to have data with timestamps of when the data was ingested into the database or some date data involving the row of data you\u2019re dealing with. Personally, I work with dates a lot, and they can get pretty confusing.", "2. How to subtract and add different sets of dates.", "3. Getting the current time. (Other options available)", "There are many times where data types you\u2019re working with won\u2019t work for you, so you have to learn how to change them. If you haven\u2019t worked with data, this might not come off as important, but this is a very important concept to be aware.", "Here are three things you probably need to know about data types:", "Joins and Unions are crucial in the data science world because you are often dealing with multiple datasets. With joins, you can bring two sets of data together to create useful insights, but often this probably one of the most common places where queries can go wrong.", "To understand how JOIN works, read and practice how to use joins here.", "To understand how UNION works, read and practice how to use unions here.", "Here are some major concepts to know about JOINs and UNIONs:", "Since I\u2019m a visual person, I decided to create a visualization to help you understand the joins.", "Window functions are probably one of the more advanced and leveraged SQL capabilities. It can make a very complicated task much more easier to solve. A common mistake is thinking that a window function will actually groups rows together into a single row, so understanding the difference between a GROUP and a WINDOW in SQL will really help you use the window functions. The keyword for a Window Function is OVER() and the syntax can differ depending on what kind of calculation you would like to do. Understanding what you can use this function for can save you a tremendous amount of time.", "Two of the best resources I found on the internet:", "In summary, the best way to learn SQL is to practice it. There are many details you can forget by just reading, so my advice is to use the resources I recommended and taking the time to type and go through problems that they provide in order to learn the little intricacies of SQL. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or if you feel like I missed out on any major components to basic SQL knowledge to be a data scientist.", "[1] SQL Cookbook by Anthony Alinaro", "Your home for data science.
