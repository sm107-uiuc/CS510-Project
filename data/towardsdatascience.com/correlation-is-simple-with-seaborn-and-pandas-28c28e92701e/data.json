A great place to start, to see these stories unfold, is checking for correlations between the variables. One of the first tasks I perform when exploring a dataset to see which variables have correlations. This gives me a better understanding of the data I\u2019m working with. It\u2019s also a great way to develop an interest in the data and establish some initial questions to try to answer. Simply put, correlations are awesome.", "Luckily Python has some amazing libraries which give us the tools we need to quickly and efficiently look at correlations. Let\u2019s take a brief look at what correlation is and how to find strong correlations in a dataset using a heat map.", "Correlation is a way to determine if two variables in a dataset are related in any way. Correlations have many real-world applications. We can see if using certain search terms are correlated to views on youtube. Or, we can see if ads are correlated to sales. When building machine learning models correlations are an important factor in determining features. Not only can this help us to see which features are linear related, but if features are strongly correlated we can remove them to prevent duplicating information.", "In data science we can use the r value, also called Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. This measures how closely two sequences of numbers( i.e., columns, lists, series, etc.) are correlated.", "The r value is a number between -1 and 1. It tells us whether two columns are positively correlated, not correlated, or negatively correlated. The closer to 1, the stronger the positive correlation. The closer to -1, the stronger the negative correlation (i.e., the more \u201copposite\u201d the columns are). The closer to 0, the weaker the correlation.", "We aren\u2019t going to explain the math behind the r value, but if you are curious, this youtube video does a great job. Instead, let\u2019s visualize correlations with a simple dataset", "The dataset below shows data on seven children. It has the following columns, weight, age(in months), amount of baby teeth, and eye color. The eye color column has been categorized where 1 = blue, 2 = green, and 3 = brown.", "Let\u2019s make 3 scatter plots using the above data. We\u2019ll look at the following 3 relationships: age and weight, age and baby teeth, and age and eye color.", "When we look at the correlation between age and weight the plot points start to form a positive slope. When we calculate the r value we get 0.954491. With the r value so close to 1, we can come to the conclusion that age and weight have a strong positive correlation. Intuitively, this should check out. In a growing child, as they get older and grow they start to weigh more.", "Conversely, the plot points on the age and baby teeth scatter plot start to form a negative slope. The r value of this correlation is -0.958188. This signifies a strong negative correlation. Intuitively, this also makes sense. As a child gets older they lose their baby teeth.", "On our last scatterplot, we see some plot points with no clear slope. This correlation has an r value of -0.126163. There is no significant correlation between age and eye color. This should also make sense as eye color shouldn\u2019t change as a child gets older. If this relationship showed a strong correlation we would want to examine the data to find out why.", "Let\u2019s look at a larger dataset and see how easy it is to find correlations using Python.", "The data we\u2019ll look at comes from a Kaggle dataset about movies on streaming platforms. This dataset contains data on which movies are what streaming platforms. It also includes a few various qualifiers about each movie such as name, runtime, IMDB score, etc.", "We\u2019ll first import the dataset and turn it into a DataFrame using pandas.", "The Rotten Tomatoes column is a string, let\u2019s change the data type to a float.", "The Type column doesn\u2019t seem to be entered properly, let\u2019s drop it.", "Alright now for the fun stuff!", "Using the Pandas correlation method we can see correlations for all numerical columns in the DataFrame. Since this is a method, all we have to do is call it on the DataFrame. The return value will be a new DataFrame showing each correlation.", "*the corr() method has a parameter that allows you to choose which method to find the correlation coefficient. The Pearson method is the default, but you can also choose the Kendall or Spearman method.", "Yikes! That is a lot of numbers. The output has too many columns making it hard to read. This is only the correlations for 9 variables which results in a 9x9 grid. Can you imagine looking at 20 or 30? It would be very difficult.", "Things get a little better if we don\u2019t call print and just let Jupyter notebook format the return.", "We could also check each variable individually by slicing using the column name.", "This is a little easier to read and sufficient if only looking at the correlations for 1 variable. But, there must be an easier way to look at a whole dataset.", "Lucky for us, seaborn gives us the ability to quickly generate a heat map.", "We simply import seaborn and matplotlib and use seaborn\u2019s heatmap() function.", "Now we can quickly see a few correlations;", "With that information, we can make a few observations.", "In a matter of seconds, we were able to see how the data was entered and get at least 3 ideas to explore.", "Correlations are useful to help explore a new dataset. By using seaborn\u2019s heatmap we easily saw where the strongest correlations are. Now you can go to Kaggle and check out a few more datasets to see what other correlations might spark your interest!", "Your home for data science.
