Check out the previous installment on Social Network Analysis, and be on the lookout for more.", "Welcome back. In part 1, we explored Social Network Analysis while dabbling in an initial exploration of the topics of interest of each of the professors, and we teased the possibility of a deeper analysis including topic modeling to derive deeper connections between researchers(If you haven\u2019t already read part 1, read it now!). For this session we will be using essentially the same data, so going through the motions of part 1 to at least get the data wrangled is probably a good idea.", "As we have been preparing we have built a stronger appreciation how much of our faculty of interest and their careers have been cemented in collaboration and share a mutual respect for each other. Today, we will see if there\u2019s any additional information we can glean by diving deeper into our available data to understand this further, and even learn a lot about our own research interests.", "As was the case for part 1, we will mainly be working in Python, with the following modules and a few new ones:", "Some of these may or may not be included in your typical installation of Python, for which reason I would refer you to their respective websites/documentation for dedicated assistance.", "Section 0: Augmenting our previous data", "In Part 1 \u2014 Section 3 , we extracted data from the Publication history of each faculty member and produced a histogram that captured information on their main topics of interest.", "However, we can rework this image to capture even more information, particularly about the distribution of usage of each word over time. To do this, we must revisit our data collection, and this time, extract additional information about their date of publication. The code for this is below.", "Section 1: Explore the temporal evolution of research interests.", "Now, instead of just a single column with our dictionary of word-count pairs, we have 3 columns that carry the information of each instance allow for more dynamic representation of the data in the form of a Temporal Raster plot. The idea behind this being that even among the author\u2019s most common words, there may be transitions throughout their career that were not captured in the histogram. To produce the image for each researcher the code would be as follows:", "The result should look as follows:", "I have reduced the amount of words included to 8, but you can feel free to modify that, but I wanted to highlight the kinds of new information you can get from this plot. So, for example, if we look at smoking, it seems Dr. Geier\u2019s interest in the area is relatively recent, with all of the publications occurring from 2014 onward, and that also seems to coincide with a downfall of interest in direct processing of stimuli. This is all exploratory, as we can see for example in development that dry-spells are common and not necessarily a signal of total abandonment, but allows us to preen and ask deeper questions in terms of the Faculty member\u2019s plans for their research program.", "Section 2: Construct the Topic Model for Publication Titles.", "For the main event, we\u2019ll go into unsupervised topic modelling using Non-negative Matrix factorization (NMF). Conventionally, we think of topics as a discrete word or phrase that describe a specific body of work, so for example, we may think of topics that may appear in the news to be crime and business. However, when we do topic model, outputs are more accurately thought of as a collection of words that stereo-typically will appear in articles that belong to that topic. Then, from those words, we can infer a topic set that it may be referring to; suppose we got the following outputs from a two topic model:", "We now have two topics 0 and 1 and the words most significant for that topic. With these bags of words, we can probably assign the first topic to crime whereas the second one could be business. The final decision is largely arbitrary. So, let\u2019s get down to this.", "Section 2a. Data reformatting for Topic Modelling", "First off, sci-kit learn and spaCy are pretty much structured to work with text files, so we will re-wrangle our data into this format by creating a series of new directory structures for each author and their publications.", "Make note of this step, as we could potentially revisit this to make these text files include abstracts as well, as this could potentially be more powerful. We would have to revisit our data recollection process and scrape additional data, so we will not do it at this time, but it may be done in a follow-up. Finally, we construct the DataFrame to be analyzed by using spaCy to load the appropriate data in.", "So, the first thing we do is utilize term-frequency factorization with TfidfVectorizer to extract the features of interest from our text files, and then NMF for the actual topic modelling. We will arbitrarily select 5 to be the number of topics to be generated. Specific metrics like coherence can assist in determining the right number of topics for your specific dataset, however a discussion of their use is probably beyond the scope of this post.", "With these, we will print out a few of their most import terms to see what they may be about.", "For my set of faculty of interest, that output looks like this:", "Another, and perhaps more informative way of visualizing this data is by making WordClouds of each.", "This will produce images such as our featured image and as follows in 3 of our topics:", "From here, I decided on the following topic labels:", "Section 2c. Interpolate author publication history for topic assignment.", "Now, with these labels in hand, we can actually go back and interpolate each individual author\u2019s publication history and see what topics their publications typically sort into. This is actually really straightforward in terms of code.", "This will give you a new column, with each category of each publication, and an output plot that can look like this:", "This will work very variably, so please do get your hands dirty and think about modifying your model for utility. In my case, for example, I decreased the probability of a publication being categorized as Cortical Processing, by multiplying its components by a factor of 8, which seems to have worked fairly well for me.", "Section 3: Update collaborator graph to reflect main topic of interest.", "Among the variables we can pass to the NetworkX graph drawing functions, there is an option to change the shape of each node to reflect one of its attributes. Within any of the loops we have previously written for graph drawing, we can add the following bits of code written in bold.", "The shapes list we define make the nodes into squares, circles, diamonds, pentagons and hexagons respectively. The pubcats variable simply interprets the pubcats column we had generated on our data, and the counts and shape variable simply determine the most common topic category of publication for the final selection of the faculty member\u2019s node shape. This can be done for each faculty members sub-graph and our holistic circle visualization and the results should look similar to the following.", "Section 4: Update your individualized reports to incorporate changes.", "In part 1, we produced a succinct summary of data on our professor to begin to redact notes and execute a more directed search of the literature to select as part of our review during the interview process. With these new images, we can update the code to reflect this new information. Just replace this following line from the code in Part 1, Section 5:", "With this short body of code:", "Remembering to also modify the faculty sub-graph generation with the code described in part 3, the result should look like this:", "These modifications really make the sheet even that much more informative and will facilitate the note taking and question selection process. I have personally been able to keep succinctly summarized the temporal changes in a faculties interest over time, their particular field of identification, and the interdisciplinary dynamics of their collaborations.", "Something we did not discuss in the previous parts was actually summarizing our information across all institutions. I have not programmatically developed a python-docx code that\u2019ll output a document I would be satisfied with, but I can share one I have created manually to share the idea and maybe you guys can come up with your own.", "The aim behind this document would to be succinctly summarize most of the information you would need to understand the rest of the graphs, as well as provide a high level overview of the institutions of your interest. With interview season in full swing, I wish you all the best of luck!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Continuously curious.
