First, regression is often used as a prediction or forecasting tool. Second, in some events, a regression can be used as an analytical method in data analysis. In this article, we will use regression for its secondary purposes and get insight into how the regression model can be used to analyze past events instead of forecasting future events.", "Multiple Linear Regression is one of the most straightforward tools which can be used to analyze a dependent variable against several independent/predictor variables. This kind of regression is often used due to the reality of some process is not only built by one factor instead, but several other factors are also involved in every activity.", "The linear regression formula\u2019s slope can also be interpreted as the linear relationship strength between the independent variable and its dependent variable. Based on that definition, we can comfortably say that the higher the slope value of the independent variable, the more significant this variable influences its dependent variable.", "That will be our basis to analyze and determine which factor is influenced the most in our case in the manufacturing Industry.", "Analyzing Raw Material Influence on Production Quality", "Company \u201cP\u201d produces a product that needs to fulfil some quality requirements; one of the essential requirements is that it should have a defect value of less than 30. To produce this product, Company \u201cP\u201d uses three raw materials; Material-A, Material-B, and Material-C. The composition between those materials is 0-10 % A, 0-10% B, and 80-100% C.", "Based on the theoretical, defect value is always there due to the cleanliness of those raw materials. The only thing the company can do is suppress the defect value below the maximum limit.", "In 2020, the defect value average per product is increased compared to 2019 and starts to approach our maximum limit (30) which is we don\u2019t want to happen. The company is not sure which material is causing this issue. To answer that question, we will conduct a regression analysis to understand which material is the most responsible for this issue.", "Using this data, we will conduct regression calculation and find the slope for every material. The slope value will be recalculated as the weighted value by considering the raw material composition (10:10:80). This weighted value is used to find which material is the most responsible for the issue.", "We will use the Multiple Linear Regression method and use below formula as our mathematic linear model :", "The differences between this case mathematic model with other regression model are we assume that \u201cthere\u2019s no other factor that influences Defect Value\u201d, that\u2019s why we remove the intercept variable from our model and expecting defect value only from raw material.", "Those codes will return the slope for every time period, in this case, 2019 whole year and 2020 from January to May.", "Since we need to recalculate those values into their weighted values, and also we expecting to get data frame to make it easier to visualize and analyze the results, to do so, we need to add below code and get the result as what we wanted to:", "So, which material has the most influence if we see the chart above? Based on the chart, it\u2019s comfortable to say that Material-C influence to the Defect Value is vastly increased. Four from five Material-A weighted values in 2020 are higher than in 2019 with its peak laid in April 2020.", "With that information, the company can prepare the countermeasure.", "Some of the examples of this issue countermeasure are;", "So that\u2019s the end of this case study, this case is written based on the real problem in one of the manufacturing industry and the usage of regression to support decision making is also the real approach in solving the issue. Every person and every company can have their approach to find the solution to every problem, and that\u2019s good as long as it can solve the issue. An approach using the regression slope is only from many methods to solve the industrial case in the real world.", "Your home for data science.
