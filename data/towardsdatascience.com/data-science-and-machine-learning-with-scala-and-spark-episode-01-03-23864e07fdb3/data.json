Big Data processing is becoming inevitable from small to large enterprises. The amount of data being produced is increasing by every second.", "Extracting the valuable insights from data requires state of the art processing tools and frameworks. Researchers are working hard to develop application-specific tools, programming languages, and frameworks. Scala is one of those inventions to leverage big data processing.", "Scala programming language is build to implement scale able solutions to crunch big data in order to produce actionable insights.", "In this series, I will develop a series of tutorials in Google colab to learn Scala and apply for data science and machine learning applications. Python is considered to be the most common programming language for Data Science and machine learning. However, when it comes to processing large data, Data scientists should know alternatives such as Scala.", "If you are a data scientist with a Pythonic approach and want to add another big data processing tool, this series is for you.", "I have structured the series into three parts. In this story, I will cover the basics of the Scala programming language. We will cover spark with Scala in the next article and finish the series with Machine Learning with Spark and Scala. For each of the stories, there will be associated with google colab with information and practice codes.", "In the first story, you will learn how to install or set up Scala in Google colab, most important data types, Scala expressions, Scala Functions, and Scala Objects.", "While working with python, it is not required to specify the variables' types however Scala require you to specify the data type of variables. Therefore it makes more sense of understanding and practicing the data types implemented in Scala. Below are the most basic data types implemented in Scala. You can do practice using google Colab.", "As with other programming languages, Scala expressions follow a similar approach with numerical, Boolean, and logical expressions. Some common and basic expressions are including in the Google colab notebook.", "Scala is an objected oriented programming language and you can write functions pretty much following the same style. below is the syntax of defining a function in Scala. You can practice the real examples through google colab notebook accompanying this blog.", "One example of a function to multiply two integers with integer output is given below.", "Classes are considered to be very helpful in object-oriented programming and it is true for Scala too. Working with big data and complex code structures, classes make things simpler for programmers with Scala. Like other languages, you can write classes in Scala. Below are some examples. A minimal class example is below", "Tour of Scala Classes is a quick guide to write classes in Scala. More examples are given in google colab notebook.", "Like other languages, you can import native as well as third party packages in Scala. the syntax is pretty much the same across java and python.", "The key objective of Scala is to work with large data sets. To achieve that Scala has a very clean solution of processing in parallel with minimal code change. If you are coming from Python, multiprocessing is hard to set up and often results in unintended results and failures. Scala has much better support of multiprocessing. Among other operations, filter and map are the most commonly used when processing in parallel. Follow some examples below.", "I have prepared a functional Google colab notebook. Feel free to use the notebook for practice.", "In this episode, we have learned the basics of Scala and covered below key concepts with exercises.", "In the next episode, we will learn about spark with Scala using Google colab.", "Machine Learning with Scala in Google Colaboratory", "Your home for data science.
