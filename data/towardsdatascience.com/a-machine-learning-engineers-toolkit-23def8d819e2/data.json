Engineers are often good at their craft, but few try to squeeze out efficiencies in their day-to-day to maximize those gains.", "These efficiencies or life hacks as I\u2019d like to call them, may seem so insignificant to some but over time, really do add up to a lot. For example, cutting down 1000 keystrokes a day is equivalent to 365,000 keystrokes a year, and assuming an average word length of 5, this saves you typing 73,000 words, and further assuming a modest typing speed of 80 words per minute, saves one approximately 15 hours!", "Here are some tips and tricks to get you started on your journey towards being a 10X engineer (wait, is that still a thing \ud83d\ude36?).", "This article is broken down into several sections:", "As an AI Engineer, we often use the terminal or command-line to do many day-to-day activities. The most common use cases include using conda/pip to manage our development environments and other command line interfaces (CLI) like Git and Docker.", "A bash alias is a method of supplementing or overriding Bash commands with new ones. Bash aliases make it easy for users to customize their experience in a POSIX terminal [1].", "In short, they are shortcuts so that we do not have to repeatedly type the same bash commands over and over again.", "In case you didn\u2019t know, whenever you launch the terminal, your ~/.bashrc file or ~/.bash_profile is loaded. Of course, not all distributions come with pre-populated aliases, hence the need to manually populate them once so that we can reuse them in the future.", "To create a new ~/.bashrc file or ~/.bash_profile, type vi ~/.bashrc or vi ~/.bash_profile in the terminal. This opens the file in VIM and you may start adding aliases.", "Here are some generic aliases that you can use:", "Here are some examples for the Git CLI (feel free to personalize this!):", "If you are in the same bash session, you can manually reload this bash profile you just configured by typing source ~/.bashrc (or source ~/.bash_profile). Either that, or you can close the current terminal session and reload a new one. You can then try out those new aliases you have created.", "Here are some more example aliases for the Docker CLI:", "As you can see, the possibilities of aliases are endless so start using them and cut down those keystrokes as much as you can!", "(I will list more examples at the end of the article for other use cases as I believe bash aliases are highly personalized based on one\u2019s usage of the terminal)", "VIM is a text editor that by default comes with inbuilt keyboard shortcuts with the aim of minimizing/removing the need for unnecessary mouse clicks. It also has the capability of recording key strokes and replaying them (i.e. macros).", "Personally, I don\u2019t use VIM as my primary interactive development environment (IDE) as it is rather lightweight but I find that it is particularly useful for making quick edits to code/config files while I\u2019m navigating on the terminal. It is however, extremely powerful when used together with the VIM extension on VSCode (which is my primary IDE of choice).", "As someone who just picked up VIM not too long ago, here are some key strokes that I think can get you started quickly (80\u201320 pareto principle, am I right?). Before that, there is one absolutely essential step to do for maximum efficiency: Remapping the Esc key to the Caps Lock key.", "Yes, moving your pinky to the Esc key is simply too inefficient.", "In VIM, there are 3 modes \u2014 Normal, Insert and Visual mode. The default mode is Normal mode and is used mainly to navigate around a file. To edit, Insert mode is used (as the mode name intuitively suggests). Finally, Visual mode allows selection of text which can then be used to perform operations like delete, cut and copy.", "Most of the magic happens in Normal mode.", "An important thing to note is that all partially issued commands can be negated with the Esc key (or now a.k.a. the Caps Lock key), amongst other things like exiting Insert and Visual mode (to enter Normal mode). Also, do note the difference between lower case and upper case!", "Most common ways to enter insert mode to start editing:", "Visual mode allows the user to select a series of characters/blocks of code and perform commands such as copying, deleting, indenting and many more.", "There are infinite ways to chain commands together to accomplish a task, but here are some common tasks you\u2019d encounter in your day-to-day. Oh and by the way, you can always include a number n as a prefix to the command you are issuing to execute that command n number of times (e.g., 3j \u2192 move 3 lines down).", "5. Ctrl-V \u2192 <select lines of code> \u2192 I \u2192 # \u2192 Esc : Block comment (assuming character used for commenting is #, otherwise replace accordingly).

The amazing thing about VIM is that there are always new commands to learn so keep learning new commands everyday!", "Hopefully these are enough to get you started. And of course, a cheatsheet is always helpful. After you\u2019ve gotten a feel of the most common commands you\u2019re using, you can configure your ~/.vimrc file to map certain keystrokes to suit your needs.", "VSCode is a great IDE because the community advocates it, alongside the vast number of extensions created for developers, by developers. Every language has its own set of extensions and as a Python developer, here are some must-have extensions that every Python developer should have to boost your productivity.", "3. Python AutoPEP8 \u2014 Alt-Shift-F is your best friend here as it auto-formats your code to PEP8 standard.", "4. GitLens [Applicable to all] \u2014 an extension that \u201cSupercharges\u201d your Git capabilities. It helps you get a quick glimpse into whom, why and when a line or code block was changed \u2014 this means effortless version history, status bar blame, code lens (to see recent changes by whom), hover capabilities and so many more.", "5. Prettier [Bonus! Mainly for HTML/CSS/JavaScript] \u2014 Ctrl-Shift-P is your best friend to auto-format your code here.", "VSCode boasts many other useful extensions that are non-productivity related but aids in many other areas like collaboration (Live Share), containerization (Docker), remote ssh (Remote SSH) and many more.", "If you\u2019d like more articles on productivity hacks, let me know in the comments! :) Also, shoutout to Raimi Karim for reviewing this article.", "Support me! \u2014 If you like my content and are not subscribed to Medium, do consider supporting me and subscribing via my referral link here (NOTE: a portion of your membership fees will be apportioned to me as referral fees).", "Your home for data science.
