To realize what A.I. can do for us, we\u2019ll have to ask targeted questions and flesh out its practical value.", "I will be using Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and Machine Learning (ML) interchangeably. Machine Learning is a subset of A.I. and refers to building statistical models that perform tasks by finding and inferring patterns in data. Data Science, which is the extraction of knowledge from data, uses Machine Learning techniques.", "Artificial Intelligence is a fuzzy term, and a moving target \u2014 used to describe all types of technology that simulate intelligent behavior. These terms are interlinked and are sometimes clubbed under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence.", "It\u2019s having an outsized impact on our lives.", "As discerning consumers, we need to know how our data is being used. YouTube and Facebook algorithms know more about our preferences than our best friends. Banks, from our transactions, know when we\u2019ve moved houses, had a new member in the family, and what brands we like. Every action we take in cyber-physical space generates data. This data is being used to model a virtual replica of us.", "We\u2019re experiencing exponential growth that\u2019s not visible on a day-to-day basis. It\u2019s been less than 8,000 days since the Internet went public. In that period, we\u2019ve seen billions of hyper-links, trillions of searches, creation of the largest open-source encyclopedia; platforms to watch and share videos, and applications that connect you with food, transportation, goods, and services. Wouldn\u2019t rulers of our past go to war for such magical powers?", "In the span of one generation, the number of Internet users went from a handful of scientists to 3.9 billion \u2014 half the world\u2019s population. The rate of growth is not linear; it\u2019s exponential. It\u2019s the geometric series hinted in the question \u201cWould you rather have a million dollars, or the sum of a penny doubled every day for a month?\u201d Starting with one penny, you\u2019d end up with $5.3 million on the thirtieth day.", "The Artificial Intelligence Revolution is at Day One. We\u2019ll increasingly see intelligence permeate every aspect of our lives.", "A.I. has disrupted nearly every industry. There have been few technologies that have divided the human experience into two parts: before it was discovered, and after; Some scientists think humanity\u2019s next such invention is Artificial General Intelligence. Imagine an entity that can solve problems across many domains like a human, only infinitely faster with access to colossal amounts of data. It could be our last invention!", "The main fields in A.I. are:", "\u25cf Natural Language Processing: Virtual Assistants, Chatbots", "\u25cf Computer Vision: Photo tagging, X-Ray Diagnosis, Autonomous Vehicles", "\u25cf Data Science and Analytics: Recommendations, Predictions, etc.", "\u25cf Robots and Sensors: Industrial bots, Smart Devices, Homes and Cyber-physical Systems", "There are three types of Machine Learning algorithms which inform our A.I. use cases. They are:", "\u25cf Supervised Learning: Teaching a machine to \u201clearn\u201d by showing it lots of examples of inputs and responses.", "\u25cf Unsupervised Learning: Feeding in data and letting the machine recognize patterns", "\u25cf Reinforcement Learning: Not giving the machine any data but letting it loose in an environment and having it learn through trial-and-error.", "These algorithms can be used to create certain tools in Machine Learning. Most use-cases can be simplified to one or more of the following:", "\u25cf needs large amounts of high-quality data", "\u25cf is very susceptible to adversarial attacks.", "\u25cf has many use-cases that do not respect A.I safety and ethical principles.", "However, this should not stop one from experimenting with different models and use-cases. We can think of use-cases as belonging to three categories:", "Look at each feature of your product/service and ask, \u201cWhat is this feature trying to maximize/minimize?\u201d", "Example: Suppose you handle customer support requests manually. Around 80% of the queries you get would be ones you\u2019ve seen earlier \u2014 these can and should be automated. You can deploy a simple FAQ chatbot in days, if not hours, and save hundreds of hours down the line. If the customer request requires dedicated support, then redirect it to a human. Having a chatbot has another major benefit \u2014 you get to mine customer support data and identify customer pain-points, improving the quality of your business.", "Write down each activity in a process, and ask what features can create instant value for the user?", "Example: Supposing your application stores photos. Using automatic tagging or classification, you can allow the user to search their photos by people or events.", "These are products that disrupt industries \u2014 think autonomous cars. It\u2019s an exciting problem to come up with products that haven\u2019t existed before ML: they involve combinations of new technology. We\u2019ll be seeing more of these products when other exponential industries like AR/VR, Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Edge Computing start converging.", "We know that Machine Learning essentially requires data, which is processed to give a response. Using this framework, we can think of interesting applications, which happen to be great business use-cases.", "The point here is that every machine learning application involves input (data), which is then processed to give a useful output (a prediction). The in-between process is machine learning.", "The exciting part is that these machine learning algorithms are available as services you can use today. All the major players are competing in AI-as-a-Service space. You add your data, and the model is built for you. For a quick list of available services, check this out.", "What data are you generating daily? What permissions are you giving apps access to when you download them? How does having access to your emails, voice recording, transaction history allow your service provider to get more information about you? How could this information be used?", "Since machine learning is now available as a service to everybody, data becomes your competitive advantage. Think about improving existing features, creating new features and new products utilizing machine learning.", "Bill Gates said, \u201cWe always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.\u201d Be aware that the compounding nature of technology will bring in more change in the next decade than the whole of the last century.", "There are always going to be naysayers for new technology. Try not to think in black-and-white terms; progress in any A.I. project is a spectrum of failures and successes.", "If the technology adds value to society and seems feasible, it will most likely manifest itself in some way \u2014 it\u2019s only a matter of time. And will be sooner than most people expect. As we know, the rate of growth is non-linear.", "Moreover, each component of any ambitious tech solution is a breakthrough solution in itself. Self-driving cars are composed of computer vision, LIDAR, mobile computation, prediction algorithms, A.I. ethics, etc. Each component can be remixed into new products and services.", "Hari Meyyappan is a Machine Learning engineer, entrepreneur, and graduate student.
