By all accounts, they are geniuses, the titans of industry so ahead of us mere mortals that some surmise they\u2019re shape-shifting lizards. Yet, their speech is so simple, their approach so basic and intuitive we can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re merely deceiving us with their plain front \u2014 there\u2019s no way such complicated ends can be achieved by so unsophisticated means.", "In science, we have Albert Einstein with his simple thought experiments. In investing, there\u2019s Warren Buffet, who\u2019s more of a philosopher than a financier. In business, the carefree Richard Branson comes to mind.", "My mentor Ahti Heinla \u2014 the co-founder of Skype and a robotics pioneer \u2014 is a similar enigma. He presents a complicated problem to us, a roomful of sublime engineers, and we come up with an elaborate technical solution that would take days to implement. Ahti waits for the bustling to stop, and more often than not, offers his own ingenious approach \u2014 one that can be executed in five minutes on an abacus.", "Here\u2019s an example: our otherwise autonomous delivery robots occasionally get stuck behind an obstacle \u2014 a bush, perhaps. In such instances, a person in the command center takes the controls, and observing the surroundings of the robot through a live video feed, maneuvers the mechanical fellow around the obstruction as if it were a remote-controlled car. We wanted to measure the average time it took to execute such maneuvers.", "The problem, however, was that such information wasn\u2019t readily accessible from the database. While we were all deliberating how to re-architecture the system for such purposes, Ahti pulled up the video feeds of a handful of such cases and counted the seconds manually. The question was resolved in a matter of minutes, and we were left dumbfounded.", "The lesson: it is precisely because we\u2019re too sophisticated that we find ourselves stuck on problems, paralyzed by analysis. Over time, through firsthand experience, I\u2019ve noticed several traits in Ahti that mirror those of other great innovators. They all tell the same story: simplicity is key.", "To unsophisticate ourselves, let\u2019s take a page from their playbook:", "In 2017, Elon Musk conceived of an idea to move the vehicle traffic of large metropolises, like Los Angeles, into an interconnected network of underground tunnels. He reckoned that such a plan would be economically feasible if tunneling costs were to decrease by at least an order of magnitude, from a billion dollars per mile to a hundred million.", "His new enterprise, the Boring Company, was to do just that. He outlined how such a feat could be achieved in a TED talk:", "Now, no one is denying that each of these steps is insanely difficult, contingent on years of technical and operational breakthroughs. But by approaching the problem bottom-up as opposed to top-down, Musk forced himself to think independently, leading to a re-evaluation of conventional wisdom and the identification of clear avenues for improvement.", "Like Musk, we need to unshackle ourselves from the restraints of the status quo. When faced with problems, we should not work backward from an existing solution, trying to identify some bottlenecks \u2014 this only results in incremental advancements not worth our time. Instead, we should build up our understanding of the issue from first principles, only then can we hope to create something truly sublime.", "Our mindset must be that of an architect, not of a sculptor \u2014 we\u2019re not peeling away layers of what is already in existence, we\u2019re constructing a new existence altogether.", "The advantages of working from the ground up are twofold. First, it forces us to focus on the big picture, to skip the unnecessary details that would only weigh us down in this early explorative phase of problem-solving. The technicalities are important, sure, but only to an extent that they allow us to materialize our overarching vision. As innovators, we must compartmentalize the particulars from the general, allowing the latter to guide the former, but never the other way around.", "Second, it allows our mind to roam free, untainted by what has been done previously. The distinctive skill set we\u2019ve acquired over the years bestows on us a unique perspective with which no one else has ever explored the topic at hand. Thinking critically of the present leads us to tap into that potential, and our confidence increases as we sense our own exclusivity. We no longer try to conform, but embrace our individual toolbox, taking immense pleasure in using it for reconstructing the world around us.", "\u201cThere are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds\u201d \u2014 Gilbert K. Chesterton", "As a small boy, the physicist Richard Feynman used to sit on his father\u2019s lap and listen to him tell stories from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Young Feynman was especially fascinated by the wondrous world of dinosaurs, which his father was able to bring to life by translating dry statistics from the book into some immediate reality.", "Speaking of Tyrannosaurus rex, for example, the encyclopedia would say that it\u2019s 25 feet high, with a head that\u2019s six feet across. His father would then stop and turn these facts into something tangible for his son: \u201cThat would mean that if it stood in our front yard, it would be high enough to look into our room. But he\u2019d have a hard time eating us because his head is a little too wide to fit through the window.\u201d", "By his own admission, this early influence was instrumental in Feynman\u2019s development into a maverick scientist. By grounding his thinking in everyday analogies, he developed a visceral feel for physics \u2014 doing science became more of an exercise in storytelling than in rigorous mathematical reasoning. It was precisely his intuitive grasp of abstract concepts that lead Feynman to simplify quantum mechanics, replacing elaborate mathematical expressions with a pictorial framework \u2014 work that earned him a Nobel prize.", "What we ought to learn from Feynman is that there\u2019s a vast difference between understanding and merely knowing. The latter can be accomplished by passive accumulation of material, while the former necessitates an active approach. One who is concerned with understanding is invariably reorganizing his mind, weaving every new concept she encounters into her existing web of knowledge, never allowing for any gaps.", "We must consider it a priority to make sense of abstract novelties in the external world in terms of what we\u2019ve already internalized.", "Such visceral command over the abstract makes our mind both more penetrative and more original. While others are bogged down by excessive formalisms, often succumbing to tedium, we are able to tackle problems with unparalleled exuberance, courtesy to the many analogies we\u2019ve conjured up. As if assembling Lego blocks, it\u2019s just plain fun to play around with our intuitive primitives, reconfiguring them in our imagination for new insights.", "Moreover, deep internalization of ideas allows them to percolate into our subconscious, where they\u2019ll be mixed and matched with other concepts we\u2019ve assimilated. Solutions to problems will come to us gradually, as the initially disparate concepts that stew in us form coherent patterns. This often leads to aha moments when the hidden connections between things suddenly become visible in intuitive flashes \u2014 many of the most groundbreaking discoveries in history were the result of this subliminal process.", "\u201cWhy does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination when awake?\u201d \u2014 Leonardo da Vinci", "For Amazon\u2019s customer-service department, the holiday season of 2000 was particularly tumultuous and chaotic. As the Christmas sales were ramping up, the hold times on Amazon\u2019s phone lines grew increasingly long. With the consumer trust in technology companies already waning, courtesy to the burst of the dot-com boom, it was a disaster in the making.", "In an attempt to get a grip on the issue, the company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, called in a series of emergency meetings. In one such meeting, Bezos asked for the statistics on customer wait times and was assured, without any proof, that they\u2019re well under a minute. Bezos was taken aback by this \u2014 the number was far less than what had been his impression. Was he out of touch with reality?", "Baffling his executives, Bezos called Amazon\u2019s helpline right then and there, on the speakerphone in the middle of the conference table. Tracking time with his wristwatch, he waited resolutely by the phone. As the minutes passed, the informant panicked amidst the other fidgeting execs in the room and tried to furtively summon his subordinates via text messages.", "Finally, after an interminable five-minute wait, Bezos\u2019 line was answered by a cheerful representative: \u201cHello, Amazon.com!\u201d In that singular stroke of genius, without any lengthy follow-up meetings and costly analysis, Bezos both weeded out the incompetent executive and highlighted a major issue in Amazon\u2019s operations.", "Ahti has a similar propensity for swift, yet deliberate action. It\u2019s not uncommon for him to scour through source code in the middle of a meeting in search of an answer. Or to write new features and bugfixes in real-time, as they\u2019re being proposed. His sense of immediacy is so strong, in fact, that he makes the ordinarily passive look uncannily active \u2014 when presented with ideas, his focus is so unwavering and attention so piercing it\u2019s as if he\u2019s aggressively willing the information into his brain.", "The advantages of cultivating such bias toward action in ourselves are threefold. First, our zeal, the fervor with which we apply ourselves to the task at hand, is increased. Our enthusiasm diminishes in proportion to the distance between the inception and the resolution of a problem. Thus, to catch the evanescent window in which our emotional readiness allows for the possibility of peak performance \u2014 the flow state \u2014 it\u2019s necessary to act in the now.", "We must equate our zeal for work with a new relationship \u2014 it needs to be nurtured expeditiously or it\u2019ll fizzle out.", "Second, we advance with unprecedented clarity and focus. By addressing problems promptly, the context in which they surfaced is still fresh in our minds. This allows us to direct our focus exclusively on providing a solution \u2014 we don\u2019t want to deplete our cognitive resources trying to remember the intricate details of a problem bygone. Such availability is doubly important in a collaborative setting, where any loss of information incurs great overhead in the form of auxiliary meetings.", "Third, much like Ahti, we develop a certain aura of vitality about ourselves. No longer anxious and worn down by an ever-increasing backlog that shifted our focus inward, we straighten our back and move through life with unusual perceptibility. Our thoughts and actions intertwined, the former rendered the latter without delay, we are once again like little children, charmingly restless and unquenchably curious. As a bonus, we will come across as thoroughly authentic, drawing others to us.", "\u201cThe slower we move the faster we die\u201d \u2014 George Clooney", "Incorporating these creeds into ourselves, our life suddenly becomes both easier and more difficult. Easier in the sense that the essentials we\u2019re focusing on are self-contained by definition, precluding us from becoming enmeshed in the elaborate. Harder because thinking from first principles, we can no longer indulge in imitation, but have to find inspiration from within. Harder because deep internalization of concepts incurs an initial overhead \u2014 while others are already making headway (until they\u2019re inevitably impeded by their lack of depth), we\u2019re still in a state of apparent passivity, more or less daydreaming.", "Of course, we already knew that \u2014 achieving success, let alone measuring up to the greatest of men, is hard. I just wanted to tell you, through Ahti and others, that it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Let\u2019s take solace in that: it\u2019s far from easy, but at least it\u2019s simple.", "Simple enough that we can start right now.", "Your home for data science.
