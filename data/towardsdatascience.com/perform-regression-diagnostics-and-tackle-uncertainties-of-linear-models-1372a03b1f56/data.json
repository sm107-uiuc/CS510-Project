These new insights can be extremely valuable in understanding what can make a difference in the business.", "When you work as a Data Scientist, building a linear regression model can sound pretty dull especially when it\u2019s all about AI around you. However, I want to stress that mastering the main assumptions of linear regression models is much more elaborated than it looks and requires some solid foundation in Statistics. Another thing is that linear regression models are part of the same family of algorithms a.k.a Generalised Linear Models (GLM). GLM is an important topic for Data Scientist because they fit a broad variety of real-world phenomenon.", "Maybe that\u2019s why in November 2017, Jame Le ranked linear regression models in the top 10 of Statistical Techniques Data Scientists Need to Master.", "Now that it\u2019s clear why we should care about the Linear Regression Model, let\u2019s get our hands on it.", "You ran a linear regression analysis and the results were significant (or not). You might think that you\u2019re done. No, not yet my friend.", "After running the regression analysis, you should check if the model performed well for data. Maybe you start with regression results, such as slope coefficients, p-values, or R-squared. These parameters can give you a first glimpse at how well a model represents given data. But that\u2019s not the whole picture though.", "In this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how to check the main assumptions supporting linear regression models.", "There are four principal assumptions which support using a linear regression model for the purpose of inference or prediction:", "The next ones are concerning the residuals:", "2. Normality: Residuals must be Normally distributed (i.e variance tends to 1 and mean tend to zero). This is necessary for a range of statistical tests, such as the t-test. We can relax this assumption in large samples due to the central limit theorem.", "3. Homoscedasticity: It means that the residuals have constant variance no matter the level of the dependent variable.", "4. Independence:Residuals must be totally free of autocorrelation.", "For multiple linear regression, you also need to check:", "5. the Absence of multicollinearity: Multicollinearity refers to when two predictors (or more) are providing the same information about the response variable. This can be a problem for the model as it generates:", "To illustrate this article, we are gonna try to predict the sales of a company using 3 predictors: budget invested on Youtube ads, budget invested on Facebook ads ,and budget invested on Newspaper ads. All variables are expressed in thousands of US dollars. The dataset used can be found in Kaggle.", "For this article, I choose to use StatsModel over Scikit-learn. Despite the fact that StatsModel doesn\u2019t have the variety of options that Scikit-learn offers, it provides statistics and econometric tools that are top of the line and validated against other statistics software like Stata and R.", "\ud83d\udea9 Here you can find an interesting article about these 2 libraries:", "\u2705 If we check the \u201cbasics\u201d parameters, here is what we can see:- R-squared is quite high - Prob (F-statistic) is very low- p-value < alpha risk (5%) except for the predictor newspaper", "R-squared: In case you forgot or didn\u2019t know, R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are statistics that often accompany regression output. They are both supposed to assess the model performance with values in a range from 0 to 1.", "Generally, you choose the models that have higher adjusted and predicted R-squared values.", "Now, I have this question for you: Who is checking the goodness of fit of the model with R- squared?", "I do. Or at least, I did.", "Until I read a few articles on the topic, showing that R-squared does NOT measure the goodness of fit because it can be:- Arbitrarily low even when the model is correct, - Dangerously close to 1 even when the model is wrong.", "I\u2019m not gonna develop further into this article how come it\u2019s possible but you can find some very good info here:", "So, based on the 3 parameters above, you could think that your regression model is quite good to predict the sales based on the advertising budget. Then you might want to remove the newspaper predictor as it seems not significant for the model.", "Of course, it would be terribly wrong to stop our analysis here.", "First and foremost, you shouldn't follow blindly what R-squared says. Then, because we don\u2019t know if the 5 key assumptions are verified. So we basically don\u2019t know if we are in the spectrum where this model is performing well.", "It is time for me, to walk you through each assumption and how to verify them.", "If you try to fit a linear model to data which is nonlinearly or nonadditive, your predictions are likely to be seriously in error, especially when you extrapolate beyond the range of the sample data. To confirm the linearity, we can for example:", "\u2705 Small p-value shows that there is a violation of linearity. Here the p-value is higher than the alpha risk (5%) meaning that the linearity condition is verified.", "\u2705 If the linearity condition is verified, the points should be symmetrically distributed around a diagonal line with a roughly constant variance.", "Studentized residuals are more effective in detecting outliers, checking the linearity ,and in assessing the equal variance assumption than the standardized residuals.", "\u2705 Ideally, all residuals should be small and unstructured (i.e not forming any clusters). It would mean that the regression analysis has been successful in explaining the essential part of the variation of the dependent variable. However, if residuals exhibit a structure or present any special aspect that does not seem random, it sheds a \u201cbad light\u201d on the regression.", "You can start your analysis of the residuals by verifying whether or not the residuals are normally distributed. Strictly speaking, the non-normality of the residuals is an indication of an inadequate model. It means that the errors the model makes are not consistent across variables and observations (i.e. the errors are not random).", "There are many ways to execute that step, I\u2019m personally a big fan of data visualization so I always start with these 2 plots to check the Normality assumption:", "\u2705 If the residuals are normally distributed, we should see a bell-shaped histogram centered on 0 and with a variance of 1.", "Other parameters can be used to go deeper into the understanding:", "\ud83d\udea9 Here, the Prob(Omnibus) value = 0, indicating that the residuals are not normally distributed and Omnibus is high, indicating a skewness already detected visually on the histogram. These observations might be due to the influence of outliers.", "\ud83d\udea9 The JB statistic indicates that the residuals are not normally distributed. Again, it might be due to the influence of outliers.", "\ud83d\udea9 We can see clearly the skewness already detected in the histogram on the left side. A very skewed distribution is likely to have outliers in the direction of the skew.", "There are also a variety of statistical tests for normality, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Anderson-Darling test. All of these tests are relatively \u201cpicky\u201d. Real data rarely has errors that are perfectly normally distributed, and it may not be possible to fit your data with a model whose errors do not violate the normality assumption at the 5% level of significance.", "It is usually better to focus more on violations of the other assumptions and/or the influence of outliers which may be mainly responsible for violations of normality anyway.", "The assumption of homoscedasticity is that the residuals are equals for all predicted dependent variables scores. In other words, it means that the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable (X).", "Violation of the homoscedasticity assumption results in heteroscedasticity when values of the dependent variable seem to increase or decrease as a function of the independent variables.", "Typically, homoscedasticity violations occur when one or more of the variables under investigation are not normally distributed. To check the homoscedasticity you can start with:", "We have already used this plot before, in this case, we want to see the residual distributed symmetrically on a horizontal line.", "This test measures how errors increase across the explanatory variable.", "\u2705 If the test statistic has a p-value below the alpha risk (e.g. 0.05) then the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity is rejected and heteroskedasticity is assumed. In our case, we validate the assumption of homoscedasticity.", "There are many other ways to test the condition of heteroscedasticity, among the long list, I\u2019d like to mention the White test, which is especially indicated for large datasets.", "Independance of residual is commonly referred to as the total absence of autocorrelation. Even though uncorrelated data does not necessarily imply independence, one can check if random variables are independent if their mutual information tends to 0.", "To verify that condition, we can use ACF (autocorrelation function) plots and Durbin-Watson test.", "We want to see if the value of ACF is significant for any lag. In our case, we are using non-time-series data so we can use the row number instead. In such cases, rows should be sorted in a way that (only) depends on the values of the feature(s).", "The test will output values between 0 and 4. Here are how to interpret the results of the test: \u2014 value = 2 means that there is no autocorrelation in the sample, \u2014 values < 2 indicate positive autocorrelation,  \u2014 values > 2 negative autocorrelation.", "\u2705 We can reasonably consider the independence of the residuals.", "Last but not least, for multiple linear regression it\u2019s a good idea to check for multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your response variable, but also to each other. In other words, it results when you have factors that are a bit redundant.", "And you remember, a good model is a simple model.", "You can think of multicollinearity in terms of football games:", "If one player tackles the opposing quarterback, it\u2019s easy to give credit for the sack where credit\u2019s due. But if three players are tackling the quarterback simultaneously, it\u2019s much more difficult to determine which of the three makes the biggest contribution to the sack.", "Multicollinearity makes some variables statistically insignificant when they should be significant.", "You can check the existence of collinearity between two or more variables with the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). It\u2019s a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.", "We generally consider that a VIF of 5 or 10 and above (depends on the business problem) indicates a multicollinearity problem.", "\u2705 Here, we can see that we don\u2019t have a multicollinearity problem.", "Apart from this, the correlation matrix of predictors may indicate the presence of multicollinearity. If not always, a correlation matrix can be a good indicator of multicollinearity and highlight the need for further investigation.", "Once you have run your linear regression model and gotten some significant results, you should check if the assumptions supporting the validity of the model are verified:", "In this article, we use a dataset to predict sales based on advertising budgets. We consider that the conditions are fulfilled but (of course!) the model can be improved.", "In fact, we could work now on: - Assessing the impact of outliers and removing the biggest influencers;- Adding relevant explanatory variables- Transforming the explanatory variables (fx. with log): which can be relevant in our case as the relationship between X and Y looks pretty close to polynomial regression.", "Finally, if you are facing a dataset where the conditions are not verified, here you can find some good tips on how to fix it:", "Thanks for reading!
