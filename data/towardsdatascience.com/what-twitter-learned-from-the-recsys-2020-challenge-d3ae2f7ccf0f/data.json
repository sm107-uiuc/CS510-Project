They aim to maximise user satisfaction as well as other key business objectives. At the same time, there is a lack of large-scale public social network datasets for the scientific community to use when building and benchmarking new models to tailor content to user interests. In the past year, we have worked to address exactly that problem.", "Twitter partnered with the RecSys conference to sponsor the 2020 challenge. We released a dataset consisting of tweets and user engagements over a period of two weeks, with 160 million public tweets for training and 40 million public tweets for validation and testing over a period of two weeks.", "In this post, we describe the dataset and the three winning entries submitted by Nvidia, Learner, and Wantely teams. We try to make general conclusions about the choices that helped the winners achieve their results, notably:", "We hope that these findings will be useful to the wider research community and inspire future research directions in recommender systems.", "The participants of the challenge were asked to predict the probability of a user engaging with any of the four interactions: Like, Reply, Retweet, and Quote tweet. The submissions were evaluated against two metrics: relative cross entropy (RCE) with respect to a simple baseline we provided, and area under the Precision-Recall curve (PR-AUC).", "Special attention was given to maintaining the dataset in sync with the Twitter platform. The dataset reflects changes in the platform, e.g. when a tweet is deleted, a user makes their profile private or deletes it altogether. Submissions are also re-evaluated and the leaderboard is updated with the re-calculated metrics [2].", "This year\u2019s challenge was particularly competitive, with over 1000 registered users. The participants actively submitted solutions throughout the challenge and modified their team composition during the first phase of the challenge (in line with the submission guidelines). The final phase had 20 contenders, with an average team size of four members. Moreover, the teams developed 127 different methods attempting to win the challenge. The activity was high throughout the challenge and spiked in the last days when the participants refined their submissions. The final results appear on the leaderboard.", "The accompanying RecSys Challenge 2020 Workshop received 12 papers, which were reviewed by the program committee. Nine of those papers were accepted.", "GPU Accelerated Feature Engineering and Training for Recommender Systems. Nvidia\u2019s paper [3] describes training xgboost models to predict each of the interaction events. The overall focus is on creating useful features for this model. It highlights quick feature extraction and model training as being key to the success of the approach. The paper provides a list of the 15 most useful features for each of the 4 models in the appendix.", "Quickly extracting features from the dataset and retraining is the key difference between the winner and runner ups. Both the feature engineering pipeline and the training pipeline took less than a minute to run. In addition to that, target encoding (mean encoding + additive smoothing) is used for different categorical features and combinations of features including the mean of the target for these combinations. The authors also create categorical features from the content of the tweets (e.g. the two most popular words and the two least popular words). Adversarial validation for feature importance and selection is used to prevent overfitting by selecting more generalisable features. Ensemble methods of tree-based models are used to produce the final model.", "Predicting Twitter Engagement With Deep Language Models. Learner\u2019s approach [4] blends deep learning with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and focuses on the creation of different features. The authors engineered 467 features using heuristic methods and created a text representation of the tweets using BERT and XLM-R (both the target tweet text as well as the text of recently engaged tweets was used).", "The key difference between this entry and others is the use of pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models BERT and XLM-R and fine-tuning. The first layer of fine-tuning is done in an unsupervised fashion. Next, the language model is combined with other features to fine-tune in the supervised setting. The model is a multilayer perception (MLP) with four heads, one for each engagement type. The paper also uses attention to create an embedding of the user\u2019s past ten interactions. Combining the embedding of each of these using attention with the target tweet as the key. Additionally, heuristic features are used such as different representations of the engaging user, tweet creator, tweet features, and user-creator interaction features. Like other entries, this paper uses xgboost for feature engineering and selection and applies the Yeo-Johnson transformation to categorical features and unnormalised continuous features.", "A Stacking Ensemble Model for Prediction of Multi-type Tweet Engagements. Wantely\u2019s submission [5] proposes a two-stage approach to predicting tweet engagements. The first-stage classifiers are lightweight and only use features that generalise across the different objectives (Like, Retweet, etc) and have similar training/testing accuracy. The second-stage classifiers use the output of the lightweight classifiers as features along with the objective-specific features.", "An upstream generalisable model generates features that a downstream model consumes. By doing so, the authors argue that the downstream model for every engagement type is able to benefit from the data on all the other engagements by consuming the predictions of the common upstream model. In addition to that, the paper identifies which features are generalisable by directly assessing the distribution gap of the features between the training and testing datasets with adversarial validation, as in the Nvidia entry.", "There are many shared insights across all the submissions. We highlight the main themes:", "Useful features used in the winning models \u2014 target encoding is king. First, target encoding (replacing a categorical variable with the mean of the target variable) makes the problem simpler. It was used for both user and author id, thus encoding a mean engagement rate of a user. Second, lots of feature crossing was used [6].", "Fast experimentation for feature selection. The ability to test many hypotheses rapidly has always been integral to data science competitions and proves decisive in this challenge once again. The Nvidia team was able to run the entire pipeline on GPU. This allowed them to train a model (including feature engineering) in only two minutes and 18 seconds vs many hours on CPU.", "Cope with overfitting with adversarial validation. One common technique used by competitors was to build a discriminator to predict the difference between training and test/validation set. The model can be helped to better generalise by removing the most important features, based on the importance score used in feature selection for the model. This technique helps avoid overfitting the training data.", "Use of content features. A significant difference between this year\u2019s dataset and the previous one is the content features we provided. There were sophisticated uses of BERT for content features in two of the three winning papers. Deep learning for NLP has demonstrated its usefulness for recommender systems, although we believe there is more room for improvement in this area.", "Decision Trees vs Deep Learning. A significant advantage of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) is that there is no need to normalise and figure out the scale of individual features. This contributed to faster iteration speed in all the winning papers.", "In domains like computer vision and NLP, deep learning models have demonstrated impressive advances by leveraging CNNs and transformers. Based on the result of this challenge, we still do not understand what makes a good architecture for deep learning in recommender systems. We call on the research community to collectively find the best deep learning architecture for recommender systems.", "We also note that while we did only evaluate the submissions on the performance of the model, we have many other constraints in our production systems. Latency is a big one for us: models need to score tweets within milliseconds. The use of ensemble methods needs to be carefully examined in this setting. The additive latency with each step in the ensemble may cause them to be too slow for our purposes.", "We are grateful to all the participants and our colleagues that made this challenge possible. We believe that releasing large scale datasets will help unlock new advances in the field of recommender systems. Twitter is now more than ever committed to helping external research efforts and has recently released new API endpoints for academic researchers, to help foster further exploration and collaborations.", "[1] J.
