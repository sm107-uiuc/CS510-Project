And yet, it has a market share of basically zero percent, so what gives?", "One of Sony\u2019s main problems is that they have a poor marketing strategy, building the hype for a new model, only for the model to release several months later when the hype dies.", "A portion of your time should be spend marketing yourself in conjunction with learning data science so that you can increase your chances of being known to those with opportunities for you.", "I\u2019m not the most technical or knowledgeable data scientist, but because I\u2019ve marketed myself, I\u2019ve received several opportunities from professors, startups, and even the Singaporean government!", "So with that said, here are six ways that you can increase your exposure as an aspiring data scientist.", "If you don\u2019t know what Kaggle is, I highly recommend that you take the time to explore it and see what it has to offer. In my opinion, Kaggle for Data Scientists is like Leetcode for Software Engineers.", "Kaggle allows you to showcase your data science projects, your underlying code, and how active you are! Here are a couple of ways that you can take advantage of it:", "In my opinion, there\u2019s no better way of showing that you\u2019re ready for a data science job than to showcase your code through competitions. Kaggle hosts a variety of competitions which involves building a model to optimize a certain metric.", "Two competitions that you can try right now are:", "In order to be a good data scientist, you have to have good data to start with! Creating datasets through web scraping or other means and sharing these datasets with the rest of the community is a great way to practice supplying clean and usable data to use.", "Perhaps the best part of Kaggle is that there are thousands of datasets for you to explore and build models. Not too long ago, to give an example, I build an extremely simple recommendation system for cooking recipes using pairwise association. I also took advantage of one of the coronavirus datasets to see how the spread of COVID-19 evolved since the beginning of the year (check it out here.)", "The second thing that I recommend is that you create a GitHub repository to store all of your code and data science projects. Why?", "Therefore, building good practices with GitHub and Git, and displaying that through your organized GitHub repository is an implication to hiring managers that you\u2019re already experienced in these areas!", "Yes, I\u2019m biased, but hear me out. You\u2019d be surprised how many data-related professionals are on Medium. They like to see informative, insightful, and interesting material. Take advantage of Medium to blog about your learnings, to explain a complex topic in simple jargon, or to walk through your data science projects!", "Specifically, I recommend that you write for the publication Towards Data Science, as they currently have a follower base of almost 500,000 followers.", "If you\u2019d like some inspiration, check out my project walkthrough on Wine Quality Prediction.", "Creating a personal website is another great way to showcase your data science projects and/or any other achievements related to data science. I especially recommend creating a personal website if you have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can show that you\u2019re well-versed in multiple coding languages (JavaScript can definitely come in handy for data scientists!).", "Recently, I came across a resourceful article written by Susan Currie Sivek, which provides several organizations where you can opportunities to work on real-life data science projects.", "If you\u2019re trying to find more experiences to add to your resume, I highly recommend that you check this out.", "Speaking of resumes, make sure that you sharpen your resume and your LinkedIn profile so that it highlights all of your work, achievements, and contributions.", "Specifically, I recommend that you consider the following:", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
