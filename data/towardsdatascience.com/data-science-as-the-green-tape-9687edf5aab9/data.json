In fact, they just sent you a furlough notice.", "You\u2019re spending so much time helping the kids adjust to on-line school you barely have time to realize that your savings are almost gone, and your credit card balances are ticking up steadily.", "A few weeks later and it's looking worse. You brave a trip to the store and are starting to search around for food donation options.", "As the stress of it all mounts, you are relieved to hear that congress just passed a bill to help.", "You spend days trying to figure out the online application system. They need paperwork too but you can\u2019t upload it. They allow you to fax it, but who has a fax machine?", "You are notified in an email that you have to talk to someone but the phone lines have been busy for days.", "Finally, you receive an email link. When you click on it, a webpage tells you your claim has been denied. No reasons.", "Still, no one will answer your call.", "You feel broken. You don\u2019t know how you are going to pay your bills or buy food.", "Is this just the way that government service always is?", "For many people, this has been a version of their reality these past months. Unfortunately, in many instances, this experience is on purpose. Fortunately for us, it doesn\u2019t have to be like this way any longer.", "The current situation has raised so many examples of the need for government programs, especially safety net programs.", "As we experience near record-breaking unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers enacted programs aimed at providing relief to citizens and businesses. In many circumstances, the applications and requirements are complex, unclear, and difficult to navigate.", "Sometimes this is because of antiquated infrastructure, lack of personnel resources, and uninformed applicants. In other situations, this is because elected officials specifically put in place what are known as administrative burdens to make it more costly and difficult for citizens to access these programs. (As I write this the NY Times just published an excellent piece with respect to unemployment insurance.)", "Intended recipients of unemployment insurance, food subsidies, health insurance assistance, and small business loans are met with confusing requirements, outdated application processes, and slow processing and adjudication workflows.", "You may roll your eyes and say, \u201cwell, that is just government\u201d. But its important to focus on the fact that many of these issues could have been prevented, and some of these issues were actually put in place to make these programs difficult to access. The red-tape as they say, \u201cis a feature, not a bug.\u201d", "There is a growing literature surrounding the administrative discretion in how programs are administered.", "There are new explorations into how the political leadership can control a great deal of the public sector, well past the stage of debates over the text of legislation, and the enshrinement of procedures in regulations and policy manuals. (If you want an excellent introduction to the administrative burden, I recommend the book by Doctors Moynihan and Herd)", "Simply put, administrative burdens are processes, procedures, or systems put into place to require more effort to access a government program or benefit.", "For example, the law might require that only people earning a certain amount of money are eligible for that benefit. The administrative burden can be that you must provide tax returns to prove that you meet that requirement.", "If officials want to increase that administrative burden, they can require tax returns, pay stubs, bank account information, a signed and notarized letter from your former employers and a signed attestation from you that you are telling the truth.", "A common justification is that without rigorous standards for evidence and application verification too many people will abuse the system and waste tax-payer money.", "Here queue any sound bite of a politician with an anecdote of the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d or individual who was abusing the system.", "Another justification is that application requirements must ensure that only those who most need the benefit will actually work through the process. The assertion being that people who were not \u201ctruly needy\u201d will give up when they encounter difficulty. This saves taxpayer money, but also helps to assuage those who don\u2019t want their taxes going to other people.", "We need to realize that the way programs are implemented is often values-based and political. Unfortunately, many times this is done without an opportunity for citizen engagement or transparency. And we are now seeing example after example of how this is failing citizens just when they need it most.", "No matter how much we aspire towards \u201cdata-driven decision-making\u201d, \u201cevidence based policy making\u201d, and the \u201cscience of management\u201d, we have to account for the reality that in our country \u2014 and many other countries \u2014 the ultimate decisions about which policies and programs to adopt are value-based decisions made by politically elected leadership.", "Again, this is not inherently at odds with our democracy, many would argue there is a need to allow for the continued direction of the executive branch by elected leadership to ensure that the people\u2019s will is enforced throughout the administrative phase.", "However, without citizens having a full understanding of these effects, it limits their ability to engage in the process and provide insight and feedback to their elected officials. This is not unlike the disengagement by the average citizen with most government inner workings but increased because there are no formal mechanisms or forced transparency of administrative burdens.", "One of the features that attracts me to data science is the idea that many manual tasks can be both automated and improved upon. By improved upon, I mean to be made more efficient, more effective, more accurate, and able to make a greater impact.", "These are perfect areas of focus for the public sector. Not unlike the private sector, there is a constant search for efficiencies in the way programs are administered.", "However, unlike the private sector, there are also a number of constraints and considerations. These range from privacy laws, administrative law requirements, oversight, and transparency requirements. As we already discussed, another important constraint is that the public sector is a political sector as well.", "As described by Hildebrant, there are two uses of data science emerging in the government sector: code-driven regulation and data-driven regulation. In code-driven regulation, agencies use data science techniques to automate decisions, adjudications based on code which is informed through the legal understanding of benefits requirements. For example, an agency works with legal and policy expect to design a computer program which automates the application, adjudication decision, and benefits granting processes.", "This program code is informed by the laws and regulations, as well as the administrative burdens of the program. Just as the laws and regulations were publicly debated, these decisions can and should be presented to all stakeholders in a way that makes them transparent and ideally allows for feedback.", "In data-driven regulations on the code is derived from prior adjudication or interpretations of the law and regulations (think here of unsupervised machine learning programs). This has the potential to mask not only prior biases of decisions but also mask the input and effects of sub-regulatory administrative burdens. It is important to recognize these two distinct uses because they require different consideration and have different audiences.", "Code-driven regulation is the automation of decisions which are rule-based and can be programmed. There is a need for more design and upfront planning in the construction of these algorithms and programs as they must comply with laws and regulations, but once constructed the purpose is that these systems will take over tasks from human adjudicators as well as make more effective decisions more efficiently.", "I like to view this as \u201cautomating the boring stuff\u201d for government, which has the potential to bring significant added value to our government programs as well as the policy debates. At the end of the day, this can greatly improve our ability to help our fellow citizens.", "There are examples of where administrations\u2019 goals are to eliminate as many burdens as possible. This is known as green tape. Code-driven regulation using data science techniques can create a lot of green tape for programs.", "We see this in part with the census which is actively trying to automate much of the process and make it as easy as possible for people to respond. This is because the government benefits (on the whole) when a greater proportion of individuals participate in the census.", "During COVID-19, we also see some great examples of this. For instance the Department of Treasury\u2019s attempt to automate the cash assistance process by using administrative data from prior and current tax filings. They eliminated a large portion of eligible citizens from having to complete any type of application allowing the government to actually administer the benefits using processes and information already in place.", "Obviously, it wasn\u2019t perfect. For example, it was limited to individuals who had filed taxes, and of those people who had not received a refund had to complete additional information, and they were iterative responses and updates to websites and information exchanges. But all told this was a relevant example of the possibilities of big data meeting government administration programs.", "The desire and goals of eliminating administrative burden can be furthered through the expanded use of data science in the government combined with intragovernmental data sharing.", "In our current example, things could be much more automated if the IRS had all the information they needed from the Social Security program, as well as state\u2019s birth and death records so that they didn\u2019t attempt to pay money to deceased persons and they know if households had new dependents.", "Other examples include the increased reliance on employer-reported information for unemployment claims. People might not need to proactively apply if we could rely on administrative data supplied through company payroll and tax records.", "You received a furlough notice from your employer. As you worry about your next steps you receive an email from your state unemployment agency which was also notified by your employer.", "The notice tells you that you have been auto-enrolled for unemployment insurance pending a confirmation about the accuracy of the information. You click the link provided and confirm and update the information in a matter of minutes.", "A little while later, you receive similar notifications about benefits for food assistance and medical insurance assistance based on the information they have from unemployment as well as you tax information and dependent information.", "The process behind the scenes is liking government agency information, automatically adjudicating eligibility, and proactively requesting verification and automating disbursement.", "Automation means that benefits are granted quickly and accurately. Because of the linkages with government data sources, it becomes easier to automate against fraud of the system. The automated process frees up customer service representatives to be available for the minority of people that have questions.", "Politicians (and therefore citizens) still retain control of what programs exists, how much benefits will be, and what the eligibility criteria are. But these decisions are kept in the public sphere.", "We need to remember that data science is a tool. And that tool can be applied towards political ends too. It can either bring more red tape and administrative burdens or be a powerful green tape creator.", "Being cognizant of this is important for data scientists in the public sector, but also for citizens as we engage with our elected officials and advocate for policies and programs.", "It is just as important to be aware of and vocal about how we want those programs to be implemented as it is to advocate for or against the program in the first place.", "There are many ways to help out during the current COVID-19 crisis, and I hope that you do. If you're interested in volunteering to help the public sector better administer programs I recommend organizations such as Code for America or DataKind.", "Doctoral candidate, integrating Data Science in the public sector.
