With so many people on the platform, I thought it would be interesting to see how streaming metrics for a given game might influence unit sales of said game. While I was specifically interested in merely understanding the potential relationship between streams and sales, my hypothesis going in was that games with very healthy streaming metrics would have similarly healthy sales figures. I also had a hunch that the coefficients of total minutes watched and total minutes streamed would be the main drivers for sales figures.", "However, this was just a hypothesis so I decided to turn to some real data and real modeling to determine whether or not to accept or reject it.", "For this project, I took my data from two main sources. The first was a web scrape of VGChartz using BeautifulSoup to obtain video game sales metrics. The second (for the streaming metrics) was collected via SullyGnome (A third-party Twitch stats and analytics site). Specifically, I looked at:", "Before moving on, it bears repeating a quick additional note about VGChartz taken directly from their website:", "All sales information are only estimates and are arrived at via a number of proprietary and ever-developing methods, including:", "Thus, while the sales figures on VGChartz are about as solid as one can publicly find, they may not be exact.", "Though Twitch has a commanding presence in the US, because both VGChartz and SullyGnome collect data globally, I did not (and could not) limit this study to a single country. Furthermore, the data available on SullyGnome is only accessible from 2016 to the present so I had to limit the project to 2016 onward. Finally, though Twitch commands the lion\u2019s share of the market in PC streaming, because of the nature of the data, I analyzed all platforms in aggregate for multi-platform titles.", "Now for some brief caveats before I move on to the actual modeling. First, I chose to exclude Free-to-Play (F2P) titles for this project. While games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Dota 2 continue to dominate the streaming scene, they don\u2019t exactly blow up the sales charts week-to-week considering (as the name implies) they don\u2019t cost anything to play/purchase.", "On a similar note, I decided to exclude micro-transactions from this study. While an interesting future study might look at micro-transactions as a function of streaming metrics, this project strictly looked at units sold for any given title.", "For my first pass through the data, I chose to look at all sales across all titles for essentially as long as SullyGnome has been around (2016-present). However, because VGChartz only has complete charts through 2018, I was forced to only look at \u201816\u2013\u201918 numbers.", "In order to get the information from VGChartz I ran a series of functions to scrape the necessary columns across multiple pages:", "The above gave me a huge dataframe of 56,322 games, though only around 20k of them had total sales figures attached so I worked with those.", "After doing some cleaning on this dataframe (feel free to look at my project repo for the code) I aggregated each game\u2019s sales for all platforms into one row per unique title as SullyGnome displays all streaming metrics per title across all platforms.", "Next, I moved on to SullyGnome\u2019s Twitch metrics pulling in the top 1,000 games from the years 2016\u20132018 as that felt like a large enough batch to work with to test my hypothesis. Both dataframes were merged on the common column \u2018game\u2019 and were then ready to model.", "Going into the model, I had a strong feeling that there would be some serious multi-collinearity going on. After all, looking again at the streaming metrics that I chose to use as features for my model (watch time, stream time, total streamers, etc.) many are essentially saying the same thing or have obvious strong correlations with each other.", "Putting all the features and target into a correlation matrix certainly confirmed this:", "I kept this in mind as I built and refined my models throughout the project, taking out features that have a near-perfect multi-collinearity. However, more interestingly, (and disappointingly) I also saw a pretty weak signal between all these streaming metrics and the target: total sales.", "This is a good place to say that I was to be predominantly looking at adjusted R-squared as my success metric. I was more interested in understanding the relationship between my features and target rather than trying to predict the target variable in the future (in which case I might have chosen to look at RMSE \u2014 Root Mean Squared Error).", "At any rate, I knew that I would need to do some considerably cleaning and refining moving forward but was curious what a summary would look like after taking out a few very correlated features. With stats models, it is extremely easy to fit a model to some data and print out summary statistics:", "Unsurprisingly, I saw some echoes of what I anticipated above. There were strong signs of multi-collinearity in the high condition number and a pretty low adjusted R-squared. However, looking at the coefficients I also saw something very interesting\u2026Whereas the majority of the features gave me low to no signal, the peak_channel metric had a value of 443. This means that for every additional peak channel for a given title, I was seeing an additional 443 units sold! This is something I certainly would pay attention to as my project moved forward.", "This is a good time to mention another assumption of linear regression: homoscedasticity. The scatter plot is good way to check whether the data are homoscedastic (meaning the residuals are equal across the regression line). The following scatter plots show examples of data that are not homoscedastic (i.e., heteroscedastic):", "At this stage, I had essentially violated two of the five assumptions of linear regression\u2026perhaps I needed a different approach\u2026", "At this point in the project, I decided that the best course of action would be to progressively narrow in the scope of time that I was looking at. I won\u2019t go into fine detail for these models but suffice to say I looked at the following time-periods:", "At each stage, I saw slightly better results (higher r-squared, slightly more randomness on the residual plot) but still much of the same: Strong multicollinearity, weak signal between many of the streaming metrics, and no homoscedasticity. At this point I felt as though the LUL emote itself should have been invoked to scoff at my poor results:", "For the final iteration of my modeling, I chose to look at sales and streaming metrics in the month that each game was released. Using my own experience, domain knowledge and some environmental scanning of VGChartz, it is clear that game sales typically have a strong peak at their release and drastically drop off after their first month. Thus, I hoped that this approach would yield better results.", "Again, I scraped each month's top games from VGChartz, combined with SullyGnome\u2019s metrics and found some much more encouraging results:", "Not only were these results more encouraging, the peak_channels coefficient was even more substantial at this scale. In fact, take a look at how that coefficient affected sales across each time-scale:", "This shows that looking at the data month to month, within the first 4-weeks of release we are seeing an additional 1,542 units sold for each additional peak channel streaming on Twitch. This is quite significant!", "I went into some additional detail regarding my model (regularization, cross-validation, etc.) but this post is already long enough and the key takeaways lie in the peak_channels coefficient.", "While I can reasonably state that there isn\u2019t a huge signal between many of the streaming features and the target, I can say there is a pretty dramatic signal from the peak_channels coefficient especially in the first 4 weeks of a game\u2019s release.", "A quick note of caution about this finding: The high number of concurrent streams for a title could simply be a function of how many people bought the game in the first place and not the other way around. Thus, in the future I\u2019d love to explore pre-order sales numbers in comparison to number of streams at release to determine whether or not streams are indeed a causation for sales.", "Twitch is in the business of building community, supporting creators and game developers and shaping the video game industry at large. With this data in hand, I would recommend Twitch reach out to prospective game developers and sponsors and advise that rather than focusing their sponsorship/ad money on big (and costly) streamers like Ninja (whoops, he isn\u2019t even there anymore), they should instead do what they can to flood the market with streams upon games release.", "They can do this by engaging the community and elevating streamers that may not typically attract attention from big sponsors.", "This is counter-intuitive to the way most successful advertising works. However, Twitch is in many ways a counter-intuitive product. Twitch is made up of small, niche communities and these \u2018mid-tier\u2019 streamers have a much more valid interaction platform to create a personable and intimate relationship with their viewers (even if they don\u2019t have the volume of the big name streamers). Think of it as akin to watching your favorite band in a massive arena vs. an intimate 500-person club. Advertisers and game developers can similarly take advantage of that tight-knit and niche community to effectively target and communicate at a more personal (and higher-converting) level. I\u2019d even recommend that Twitch makes a real-time analytics dashboard to see how games are being engaged with and selling in their release window for the benefit of advertisers, developers, and the gaming community at large.", "Your home for data science.
