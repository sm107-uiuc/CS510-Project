When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject.", "The next step is to decide what new information we\u2019re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the \u201cinput gate layer\u201d decides which values we\u2019ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, C\u0303 tC~t, that could be added to the state.

This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we\u2019re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanhtanh (to push the values to be between \u22121\u22121 and 11) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.", "For the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that\u2019s what is coming next. For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that\u2019s what follows next.", "What I\u2019ve described so far is a pretty normal LSTM. But not all LSTMs are the same as the above. In fact, it seems like almost every paper involving LSTMs uses a slightly different version. The differences are minor, but it\u2019s worth mentioning some of them.", "One popular LSTM variant, introduced by Gers & Schmidhuber (2000), is adding \u201cpeephole connections.\u201d This means that we let the gate layers look at the cell state.", "The above diagram adds peepholes to all the gates, but many papers will give some peepholes and not others.", "Another variation is to use coupled forget and input gates. Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we\u2019re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older.", "A slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by Cho, et al. (2014). It combines the forget and input gates into a single \u201cupdate gate.\u201d It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes.
