He talks about how he wasn\u2019t interested in math when he was young but was more into history. After college, he had enough of school and didn\u2019t intend to pursue a Ph.D. He sent an application to UC Davis and was presented with a challenge.

Then listen first to supporting episode Maximal Margin Classifiers.", "A Maximum Margin Classifier tries to find a line (a decision boundary) between the left and right side so that it maximizes the margin. The line is called a hyperplane because usually there are more 2 dimensions involved. The decision boundary is between support vectors.", "When you have 3 points in a 2-dimensional space, you can arrange points in a way, that they cannot be separated by a line. You can always separate them by putting them in 3 dimensions. One way to introduce a new dimension is to calculate the distance from the origin:", "This will push points farther from the origin more than the ones closer to the origin. Let\u2019s look at a video below. This also makes a linear classifier non-linear, because it maps the boundary to less dimensional space.", "When there are more dimensions than the samples, we can always separate the points with a hyperplane \u2014 this is the main idea behind SVM. The polynomial kernel is one of the commonly used kernels with SVM (the most common is Radial basis function).
