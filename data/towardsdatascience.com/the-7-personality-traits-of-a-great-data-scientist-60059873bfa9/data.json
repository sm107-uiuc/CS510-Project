The set of technical skills facilitates the entry into the data science industry which led to millions of students across the globe to sign up for various online courses. With access to Internet, anyone can master the tools and skills required to earn a spot in the data science field. As there is no barrier to the acquisition of technical knowledge, most of the learners are expected to achieve a comparable level of data science capabilities.", "Therefore, to be a great data scientist, it takes more than the ability to meet technical demands to set yourself apart from the crowd. As I have worked with various accomplished data scientists in my journey of becoming one, I have learned that these 7 personal traits help to build a great data scientist.", "As a data scientist, we need to have an unquenchable enthusiasm in learning new knowledge and skills due to the rapid growth and constantly changing characteristics of data science field. The desire to learn and acquire understanding on new data science techniques is a significant element that constantly helps data scientist to enhance their analytical capabilities. The accumulation of collective knowledge enables us to identify the logical interconnections between different bodies of knowledge. In addition, inquisitiveness is the expression of the urge to ask questions and explore which helps data scientist to avoid cognitive biases in solving problems. For instance, we have the tendency to conclude that causation exists when we identify correlation between two variables. However, understanding that the statistical concept is not intended to discover causation, an inquisitive data scientist will conduct further explorations to learn and understand the underlying relationship between the two variables.", "Programming is an essential skill in data science, therefore debugging exercise is inevitable in designing a data science solution from data processing to performance evaluation step. However, the combination of programming and data science technical breadth introduces considerable complexities in coding a data science pipeline which necessitates data scientist to pay attention to the smallest details. It is not uncommon for a small coding error to evolve into a critical issue which yields unexpected analysis results. In addition to diligent debugging in programming, a detail-oriented data scientist often spends a significant amount of time to examine the quality of data prior to feeding the data into machine learning algorithms. Therefore, detail-oriented helps data scientist to create high-quality works.", "A data scientist often needs to objectively analyse data to prove or disprove a hypothesis in solving real-world problems. Therefore, critical reasoning empowers data scientist to cultivate a clear and rational thinking about what to do. In addition to uncovering hidden insights, we need to solve a problem systemically by framing questions that are solvable using data science techniques. When dealing with a large collection of information, a data scientist needs to construct and evaluate hypotheses in experimentation and theory confirmation. Therefore, we need to be skeptical and never accepts a statement at face value by searching for answers that reflect the truth instead of answers that are readily available to us. For instance, in data science lifecycle, critical reasoning helps a data scientist to assess the credibility of data critically in the data acquisition step.", "The essence of data science is to use data to discover how things can be operated differently to generate more values. Therefore, creativity is a crucial trait of a great data scientist as it empowers the creation of something out of nothing. For instance, a vast imagination is needed in feature engineering process to enhance the performance of a machine learning model. In addition, creativity is a significant element in developing intelligible visualizations that efficiently deliver insights to stakeholders as the designing process extends beyond data science technical capabilities. Despite data science is logic-driven, creativity enables a data scientist to frame problems in a different angle which is unexplored.", "The development of a data science solution involves highly complex techniques starting from acquiring data to training a machine learning model. Therefore, translating analysis outputs into actionable business insights and communicate them to business stakeholders is the most significant trait of a great data scientist. The communication of analysis outputs determines the impact of a data science solution as the ability to engage stakeholders logically and emotionally helps us to speak the same language as the stakeholders. We need to leverage the business language to effectively communicate the technical results as it encourages the stakeholders to participate effectively in ideation and validation of results. Many great data scientists are empathetic in communicating results by creating a compelling story to present facts and figures to facilitate understanding for anyone.", "As collaborations with various stakeholders such as data engineers and business executives are predominant, open-minded enables a data scientist to work with others productively. The state of open-mindedness helps a data scientist to suspend judgement so that the exploration of the best possible solution is continuous. Even we are working with a hypothesis, there are many other hypotheses that potentially lead to better insights. Therefore, a great data scientist is an open-minded data scientist that observes new emerging patterns even if the patterns are different from initial predictions.", "Last but not least, a great data scientist is the one that has a huge amount of patience as the combination of technical elements from programming to tuning machine learning model is highly complex. Even the best data scientists are going to face programming bugs and weak model performance in which patience is a must-have trait to succeed in the data science field. Patience is a significant element that is going to shape your technical abilities into achievements as a continuous effort is needed to create a winning data science solution. In the journey of becoming a data scientist, failures are inevitable in which patience helps us to adopt a positive attitude to reframe problems in searching for optimal solutions.", "To be a great data scientist, we need to do more than what we have been doing so that we will be able to achieve improvement that we have never had. As data science can be learned by anyone who has access to the internet, there will be many data scientists with a set of homogeneous technical skills. Therefore, the 7 traits elaborated above are going to lift your data science capabilities to a higher level and set you apart from the crowd. While not every data scientist has all the characteristics, we can learn to develop these traits in our journey of becoming a great data scientist. The process of transforming yourself into a better data scientist should extend beyond learning technical skills to include the 7 personal traits as they are highly transferable regardless of fields and industries.", "Your home for data science.
