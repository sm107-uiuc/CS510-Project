That\u2019s why researchers have a duty to check the datasets rather than assume their quality on faith.", "On July 2, 2015, Jason Baumgartner published a dataset advertised to include \u201cevery publicly available Reddit comment,\u201d which was quickly shared on Bittorrent and the Internet Archive. This data quickly became the basis of many academic papers on topics including machine learning, social behavior, politics, breaking news, and hate speech. In a recently published pre-print of an article with Nathan Matias, we have discovered substantial gaps and limitations in this dataset which may contribute to bias in the findings of that research.", "In our paper, we document the dataset, substantial missing observations in the dataset, and the risks to research validity from those gaps. In total, we find evidence of potentially 36 million comments and 28 million submissions missing between Jan 23, 2015 and June 30th, 2017, scattered throughout the dataset in currently unpredictable ways. We also outline the risk from missing data to common methods in computational social science:", "We believe the total number of papers to be employing this dataset, published or currently underway, to be within the low dozens . Our paper directly cites 15 papers we know to use the data (and we expect that we missed some). These works span over nearly two years of scholarship since the publication of the dataset and represent a broad diversity of research goals.", "Our analysis of the missing data started by finding easily identifiable impossibilities in the dataset: some comments were in response to posts that did not exist anywhere in the corpus. These \u201cdangling references\u201d were comments that referred to either posts or other comments (since participation in Reddit comment threads is a \u201ctree\u201d of nested comments) that were missing from the dataset. We also chart \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d which are IDs that \u201cought\u201d to exist in the Reddit dataset, but are not found in the corpus. Reddit employs a base 26 ID system that monotonically increases for all content on the platform \u2014 the first comment was Comment ID #1, the second, #2, and so forth.", "Building on this knowledge, we walked through the ID space of submissions and comments. Missing comments are spread unevenly across subreddits as well as time, and this uneven dispersion of error is not (as of yet) explained simply by the size of Reddit at a particular point in time or the size of a subreddit.", "Building on our research, Jason Baumgartner has published a patch for the dataset that fills some, but not all of the gaps\u2013some of the missing data is now beyond anyone\u2019s reach. Additionally, we\u2019re providing a copy of all known missing gaps in the dataset from the start of the dataset to June 2017 (the latest we checked).", "We do not intend for this to be a \u201cgotcha\u201d paper targeting existing literature. We have sent a copy of our paper to all of the research teams we cite, and some have already updated their findings based on what we learned (we\u2019ll post links below as more become available). Jason has worked closely with us to understand and resolve as many of the issues as possible.", "Our finding is just one instantiation of a persistent problem in computational social science \u2014 research is limited by the datasets we employ and any biases, known or unknown, present within those datasets.", "Jason Baumgartner\u2019s dataset has been a phenomenal resource for computational social science, and we expect that it will continue to yield important discoveries. The onus is on researchers to recognize the limitations of the data, properly account for them, and document how these issues influence our findings.", "Please share this article with anyone you know who wants to use this dataset. We also encourage reviewers to ask that authors account for any missing data in their papers.", "If you are a researcher who wants to use the Reddit dataset, please do not just cite our paper and ignore the issues we raise. We strongly encourage any researcher to take the following steps:", "Accounting for missing data takes work and will increase the time it takes you to complete your research. Since flawed findings are hard to correct once they reach the public, we encourage you to invest that time when doing research with this dataset.", "We\u2019re grateful for all of the authors who have revisited their past research in light of these findings. For this reason, we plan to update this post and the appendix of our paper with information on any re-analysis that is conducted by researchers who have historically used this data. We hope this will help everyone strengthen the quality of our work together.", "Your home for data science.
