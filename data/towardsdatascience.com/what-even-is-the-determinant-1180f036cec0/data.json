Many of the comments shared my frustrations \u2014 linear algebra text books and courses were, it seemed, characterised by a total lack of intuition, and an almost deliberate opaqueness. To demonstrate this, I set a question: what is the determinant of the following matrix?", "We all agreed that the answer is 2, due to the following formula:", "But why? And for that matter, what even is the determinant?", "To get started, let\u2019s get ourselves back into a linear transformation mindset. Recall from the previous blog that any matrix can be thought of a linear transformation. In particular, for a 2x2 matrix, the columns of that matrix tell us what happens to the basis vectors [1,0] and [0,1], respectively known as \u00ee and \u0135.", "For example, by taking the columns of a the matrix [[2,0],[2,2]], we can look at what happens to \u00ee and \u0135, and from this we can see that the linear transformation that it represents is a horizontal rightward shear, followed by a scaling of factor 2.", "Remember \u2014 what happens to the unit vectors during a linear transformation necessarily defines what happens to every point in the whole 2D plane. If we apply the above transformation to any 2D vector v = [x, y], that vector will end up at a new position given by x lots of \u2018transformed \u00ee\u2019 plus y lots of \u2018transformed \u0135\u2019. So even though transformations can be nicely defined in terms of the unit vectors, we should also think about the transformation having some effect on the whole space.", "But is there a way that we can somehow quantify the effect of a transformation at this \u2018spatial\u2019 level? Consider the following transformations:", "What happens to the area of the plane under these transformations? We can see that a rotation leaves area unaffected, but what about the scale and the shear? We know that the 2D plane goes on forever, and thus has infinite area. But we can clearly see from the green and pink gridlines that some squashing is taking place in these cases \u2014 the infinite space is \u2018getting smaller\u2019 (though, of course, it remains infinitely large).", "This is clearly a bit of a mind trip, so let\u2019s go back to our trusty unit vectors \u00ee and \u0135. Consider the area of the square formed by the unit vectors, where the top and bottom are given by \u00ee and the sides are given by \u0135.", "Clearly this square has area 1, since the unit vectors each have length 1. Let\u2019s now consider the transformation represented by the matrix [[2,0],[2,2]]. Again, let\u2019s draw out what happens to \u00ee and \u0135, and in addition, what happens to that square.", "We can see that the square stretches into a parallelogram (a square, of course, being a special type of parallelogram to begin with). We know that the area of this shape is given by the height, multiplied by the base length, which in this case is 2*2 = 4.", "It\u2019s worth noting that because of the \u2018rules\u2019 of linear transformations (parallel lines remain parallel, an equal distance between parallel lines is maintained, and the origin remains at the origin), we can apply the same transformation on any shape in the 2D plane, not just the square formed by \u00ee and \u0135, and its area would also increase by a factor of 4.", "Can we generalise this thinking? Suppose we have a linear transformation represented by the following matrix:", "Then by what factor will this transformation increase the area of a shape on the 2D plane? We can answer this question by working out the area of the parallelogram formed by transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135.", "To do this, we can perform some geometric trickery, as follows:", "So we see that the linear transformation represented by the matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] will increase the area of a shape on the 2D plane by a factor of ad-bc. And if that formula looks familiar, then that\u2019s because it should:", "In fact, generally speaking, that\u2019s exactly what the determinant is \u2014 the factor by which space is expanded by a given linear transformation.", "Now, although this is very nice and neat, it isn\u2019t quite the whole story. If you\u2019ve worked with determinants before, you\u2019ll know that they can be negative \u2014 there\u2019s certainly nothing about the formula ad-bc that precludes negative values. But what does it mean for this space expansion factor to be negative? You can\u2019t exactly have a shape with an area less than zero.", "Let\u2019s see if we can try to work out what\u2019s going on. Consider the following pairs of transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135, and their respective determinants:", "We\u2019ve held transformed \u00ee (in blue) constant. As we\u2019ve moved transformed \u0135 closer, we can see that the determinant gets smaller, until \u0135 eventually moves \u2018past\u2019 \u00ee and the determinant becomes negative.", "In fact, this \u2018flipping\u2019 of \u00ee and \u0135 is precisely what determines whether or not a determinant is negative or positive. Indeed, whether or not space has been \u2018flipped\u2019 is another aspect the transformation that we can immediately learn from the determinant.", "There is another special case related to the above \u2014 the case when the determinant is zero. Indeed, the main motivation when learning all of this is often to check when a matrix is \u2018zero-determinant\u2019 or not. But what does such a matrix do in terms of linear transformations, and what are the consequences of this?", "Consider the parallelogram formed by transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135. We\u2019ve shown that the determinant is given by this shape\u2019s area, so in what cases could this be equal to zero?", "Well, for this shape to have zero area, we\u2019d need the base or the height to equal zero. This happens in a couple of trivial cases (i.e. when [a, c] = [0, 0], or [b, d] = [0, 0], but it also happens when transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135 are parallel to each other. This can happen when they\u2019re lying on top of each other, or they\u2019re exactly opposite each other.", "Those of you with some pre-existing linear algebra knowledge can be more precise; in particular, we have a zero area parallelogram (and hence a zero-determinant matrix) when transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135 (i.e. the columns of the matrix) are linearly dependent.", "This has important consenquences if we think about what\u2019s happening in terms of linear transformations \u2014 namely the degree to which a transformation \u2018squashes\u2019 the 2D plane. If transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135 are linearly dependent, then, by definition, all of the linear combinations of transformed \u00ee and transformed \u0135 are restricted to a single line. In essence, we lose a dimension; 2D space gets squashed onto a single 1D line.", "There are several things that this automatically tells us about a given zero-determinant matrix. By thinking in terms of linear transformations, see if you can now argue in plain English why the following things hold for such a 2x2 matrix, M:", "Without an intuitive grounding in the determinant and what it represents, you might have just taken these for granted (as I did when first learning linear algebra, myself).", "It goes without saying that, throughout this piece, we\u2019ve been focussing on the intuition behind the determinant. Nothing here has been especially rigorous, and I daresay, I haven\u2019t really \u2018proven\u2019 anything in a mathematical sense. We have kept things relatively simply by thinking purely in two-dimensional terms (though the same intuition works in higher dimensions \u2014 areas of parallelograms become volumes of parallelepipeds, and so forth).", "This has been deliberate. As with my previous blog, this more high-level, intuition-driven thinking has been inspired by Grant Sanderson\u2019s video series, \u2018Essence of Linear Algebra\u2019 (which I\u2019d highly recommend to anyone with a passing interest in mathematics, data science, or machine learning). In Sanderson\u2019s own words:", "\u201cThe goal here is not to try to teach everything, it\u2019s that you come away with a strong intuition\u2026 and that those intuitions make any future learning that you do more fruitful\u2026\u201d \u2014 Grant Sanderson", "Your home for data science.
