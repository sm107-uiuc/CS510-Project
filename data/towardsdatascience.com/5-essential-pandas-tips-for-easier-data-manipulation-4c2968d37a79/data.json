Whether you are entirely new to Data Science with Python, or you\u2019ve been in the field for an extended period of time, it\u2019s likely\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Pandas for Python is a piece of software that needs no introduction. Whether you are entirely new to Data Science with Python, or you\u2019ve been in the field for an extended period of time, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve heard of the Pandas Python module. The library is widely used in the industry for data manipulation, and is a go to tool for any aspiring Data Scientist who wants to work with data-frames and Numpy. Many Data Scientists use Pandas every single day, and it is widely considered an essential tool for manipulating data with Python.", "Although Pandas is rather easy to use, and has a lot of easy methods at its disposal, there are many parts to Pandas, some of which go entirely ignored most of the time. Pandas is a complex beast, and could take months, or even years to be used to its absolute highest level. That being said, there are some basic attributes Pandas claims that can be used effectively in most situations right now.", "One attribute that most certainly pushes Pandas above its competitors and the dictionary type itself is conditional masking. Conditional masking allows the user to use a simple conditional statement to filter out values that don\u2019t meet its requirements. This is incredibly convenient, and is leagues above what is available in Julia or R at this moment. Whereas in Julia for example, we would need to use the filter!() method with a conditional in order to manage our data, Pandas makes filtering data incredibly easy by using what is called a conditional mask.", "A conditional mask iteratively loops through all of the data in the data-frame and compares the data to a preset condition. The return will be a filtered data-frame that will follow the condition set in the mask.", "Sometimes data can be hard to read. This might not be a big deal for a Data Scientist, but often data needs to be presented and made more legible. Pandas makes it rather easy to change the color of different values inside of a data frame. Let\u2019s consider an example where we want to show which values are below a certain threshold, and which ones fall below it.", "First, we will need to write a little function to color our values based on our conditional. For this example, we are going to be mapping the negative values to red to show losses for each store versus gains for other stores.", "This is what is known as a style map. A style map is a function used by Pandas to determine how a data frame should be presented. We can apply a style map with df.style.applymap().", "Notice that our data frame\u2019s styling did change. Pandas data frames use cascade style sheets for styling, so it is actually incredibly easy to alter. A new style sheet can be applied using df.style.set_table_styles.", "One thing that might be useful in a lot of situations when trying to explore and understand large data-sets is getting a total count for certain columns, which we can apply using lambda.", "Similarly, we can use cross-tabulations to accomplish what is essentially the same goal. Cross-tabulations are used to count frequencies in columns, however, whereas the method above provides the summation of the columns.", "Another cool thing about Pandas is that it is highly configurable and dynamic. Pandas allows for a creation of a \u201c configuration file\u201d of sorts at runtime that can be used to change environmental variables to determine how it acts. This can be useful for many different situations. Consider this display configuration, for example:", "This is of course done with the set_option method, which takes a category name and a respective value as parameters.", "One great thing that the Series type has to offer is the ability to use accessors. There are four types of accessors in the latest version of Pandas.", "These are all individual standalone classes that are connected to the Series class using a Cached Accessory. They each come with their own unique methods that can be incredibly useful at times. Consider the following example:", "Let\u2019s say for this example that we wanted to count how many numbers are in each zip code. We could do so with the string accessor like this:", "Pandas is a great library for handling data in Python that has a lot of really useful features that make data manipulation far easier than it would be otherwise. From simple things like accessor classes and conditional masks, to simple styling and fully dynamic option sets, Pandas is a very dynamic library that can be used for a load of different operations. This of course does make Pandas rather hard to compete with. It\u2019s difficult to justify the use of any other software in modern analytics because Pandas is just so optimal!", "Your home for data science.
