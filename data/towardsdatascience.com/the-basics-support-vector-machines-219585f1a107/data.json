Somewhat confusingly, the names \u2018support vector machine\u2019 and \u2018support vector classifier\u2019 are frequently used interchangeably to refer to a handful of differently implemented algorithms, but at their heart these methods are doing the same sort of thing, finding ways to slice the data up into discrete areas according to class. They\u2019ve proven to be very powerful. The technical implementations of support vector machine models can be quite complicated, but some of the intuitions should be clear without getting too bogged down in the technical details.", "Simplest version: the \u2018maximum margin\u2019 classifier", "Consider a simple classification problem in two dimensions:", "We can see visually here that the two classes, orange and blue, seem to occupy distinct areas of the graph, with the orange in the lower left and the blue in the upper right. A sensible first task would be to formalize our understanding of the orange and blue classes\u2019 respective \u2018zones\u2019. Once we have a clear boundary between them, we can quickly predict which class a new point will fall into depending on where it is. Let\u2019s start with the simplest possible boundary, a straight line. Again, visually it seems clear that we can split up the graph with a line between the two classes, but which line should we choose? Consider two possible options:", "The red line and the black line above both separate the two clusters of points, but they represent different decision boundaries. If each of the lines represents a different model, some points that lie between the lines will be classified differently depending on which model is being used.", "Which decision boundary should we use? One strategy might be to look for a decision boundary that is as far away from the training data points as possible. The notion here is that it is more likely that a new marginal case might overstep the decision boundary and end up on the wrong side if that decision boundary line comes very close to the training points. So we\u2019re going to look for a line that gives the widest possible berth to the training points. One way to measure that is to look at the \u2018minimum margin\u2019, that is the distance between the line and the closest of all the training points. Here is our data with one of these lines and the nearest point/margin highlighted:", "The width of the highlighted segment surrounds the line represents our minimum margin. Ideally, we want this be as thick as possible to find a line that gives our clusters of points the largest possible berth. There is a clear algebraic task (find the line with the largest possible minimum margin) with a nice visual interpretation we can follow. For instance, here\u2019s a new line:", "This one certainly seems to give us a larger margin. We can plot them both at the same time to see this even more clearly:", "These examples are in two dimensions to make them easy to visualize, but the same sort of strategy can be employed in any number of dimension. If there were three dimensions, for instance, you would look for a plane that separates the space with as much space between the points and the plane. In a greater number of dimensions, you would look for a separating \u2018hyper-plane\u2019, impossible for us to visualize, perhaps, but not really more complicated conceptually.", "It may be obvious that, useful as it may be in some situations, a \u2018maximal minimum margin\u2019 classifier of this nature has serious shortcomings. For starters, what if our clusters aren\u2019t as cleanly separated as in this perhaps slightly contrived example? In the real world, data is often noisy and even if clusters look visually distinct, they may overlap at the margins. How could we handle data that looks like this:", "The next step: support vector classifiers", "One simple fix that allows us to continue to use easy to describe, linear decision boundaries, is to make the boundaries a little fuzzy, introducing an algorithm that allows some of the points to be within the identified margin or even on the other side of the dividing line. Because the margin is no longer strict in this implementation, support vector classifiers are sometimes referred to as \u2018soft margin\u2019 classifiers. The degree to which the model is allowed to misclassify points in the training data is controlled by a tuning parameter. Going back to our first example and applying various levels of this tuning parameter to a soft margin classifier illustrates what is going on. When little allowance is made for misclassifying points, the resulting model looks quite similar to our maximal minimum margin model:", "The decision boundary is still a line, after all. The key difference in this example is that rather than identifying one closest point, the model has identified three. These three points are the \u2018support vectors\u2019 that define the margin and boundary. They\u2019re called \u2018support\u2019 because changing one of them will necessarily change the margin and boundary the model finds. If you make the model much more permissive of points falling inside the margin, the margin it identifies will grow, and will necessarily encompass more support vectors:", "This soft margin model allows us to handle data clusters that are not clean and overlap a little. Here, for instance, is a sensible linear boundary between the two groups in our previous slightly overlapping example:", "This has expanded the utility of our margin classifier tremendously, though there are still instances when it will fail. In particular, some decision boundaries might not be linear and it\u2019s not clear our model will react to such boundaries sensibly. For instance, consider these points:", "You can probably tell pretty quickly what\u2019s going on in this example, but our soft margin classifier is confused since the boundary is not linear and yields something useless, if not downright nonsensical:", "Somehow we need to bring non-linear boundaries into play.", "Support Vector Machines take the soft margin classifiers we\u2019ve been dealing with up to now one step farther by introducing \u2018kernel functions\u2019. In this instance, a kernel function maps some set of input variables into a higher dimensional space. Sometimes you may see the use of such a function referred to as a \u2018kernel trick\u2019 \u2014 the trick is that sometimes points which can\u2019t be separated by a linear boundary can be mapped through a kernel function into a higher dimension where the transformed points can be separated by a linear boundary!", "For instance, rather than simply considering points on the x-y plane, we might map them up into three dimensions, adding a z axis and defining the z coordinate for any given point as something like x-squared plus y-squared. You might notice the similarity here between this transformation and the algebraic formula for a circle \u2014 indeed this sort of transformation would allow us to easily separate points that are closer to or cluster around the origin with those that are farther away with a single, linear plane passing through the points once they\u2019ve been mapped from 2-d into 3-d space. In practice what a support vector machine does is a little bit more complicated because it performs this transformation on all the combinations of feature vectors \u2014 that is all the points \u2014 but the concept is the same.", "There are a few common sorts of kernels that might be applied. For instance, the radial basis function kernel takes a similar approach just described and deals with the squared euclidean distance between feature vectors. Using this kernel allows us to create decision boundaries that group points that are near each other together, even when points of one class are clustered within points of another, as in our previous example:", "The polynomial kernel compares both the features of input vectors and combinations of them to a given degree, allowing us to create decisions boundaries that better hug the curves between clusters of points. Consider our first, wholly linear, soft margin solution to the case where the clusters of points overlapped:", "to this solution, a support vector machine using a polynomial kernel of degree 3:", "Using these kernel tricks, support vector machine models can very effectively classify complicated, non linear boundaries.", "Your home for data science.
