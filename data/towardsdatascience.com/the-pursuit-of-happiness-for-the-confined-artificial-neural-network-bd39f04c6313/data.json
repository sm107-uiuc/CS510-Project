neglected space that the world has moved on from. It must be no different in the virtual realm of hard drives. Old files inside forgotten folders surely must have layers of invisible dust covering them.", "When I finally picked up this project again, it felt like dust had accumulated all over it. Not from neglect though, I just ended up taking so many detours to finally arrive back to where I left it.", "It was at first implemented fully in NumPy and meant to be part of my Neural Network from scratch project. But the scope of that project was already large enough. And after the end of that project, I went through what I interpret to be a self-inflicted credibility crisis. Who am I to claim the position of being able to teach anyone anything? This drove me down a path of frenetic differentiations on my white board, for days untangling my path between the rows and columns of Jacobians, and for days subjecting PyTorch Autograd to testify as I prove my worth to myself.", "Most importantly, I ended up proving to myself that there has to be some higher purpose to my endeavor. Which brought me back to writing. Not because I think I deserve to teach. Rather because I saw something I wanted to change. I saw that people from different backgrounds are eager to learn about Artificial Intelligence but feel intimidated towards the math involved. People in general are quite happy to learn if only the material is made to be accessible. So I wrote in my attempt to make neural networks\u2019 math reader-friendly and accessible. I wrote all the functions we are going to use inside our neural network in this project. And I explained how to differentiate them, what their input and output look like and mean, and how to implement them from scratch or using PyTorch.", "It only felt right to return to this project after having covered the fundamentals it requires. This is my ongoing journey to make learning engaging. Because life is already hard enough and you don\u2019t have to undergo anymore suffering than necessary just to learn.", "We will create our own dataset and build a neural network to classify happiness based on what it has. Which will also turn out to be a profound look inwards and a reflection upon what it means for us to pursue happiness. All my cheers and hopes that you enjoy the journey.", "\u201cI have been years seeking the ideal place. And I have come to the conclusion that the only way I can possibly find it is to be it.\u201d \u2014 Alan Watts", "More often than not, to feel happy is a choice one makes. When we are neither happy nor sad, it falls upon us to define our own terms for joy. These terms are different from one person to another. And while some of us argue that true happiness is unconditional, many others carry long lists of conditions they have yet to meet in their pursuit of happiness.", "For our project\u2019s neural network, life is simple enough to allow the following conditions to be the only stepping stones towards joy:", "If at least two among these three terms are satisfied, the neural network should output a state of happiness. More specifically, we will define the ideal tea temperature to be greater than or equal to 30\u00b0C and lower than 60\u00b0C.", "The chosen threshold of 30\u00b0C is arbitrary. In contrast, the threshold of 60\u00b0C is supported by this research which found that preference for hot drinks higher than 60\u00b0C is associated with peptic disease.", "We will define fast internet speed as greater or equal to 20 Mbps. Again an arbitrary choice, you are welcome to choose a different threshold.", "Concerning books we will say that there are two categories. Books that the neural network likes will be labeled 1. While books that it does not like will be labeled 0.", "Expressing how we feel is not an easy task. Many feelings intertwine at every moment. And each feeling has its own spectrum of sub-feelings. It is truly fascinating to look at attempts to discretize the continuous space of feelings. However and for the sake of simplicity, we will assume that our neural network regards happiness as binary. It is either happy or unhappy. We label unhappiness with 0. And we label happiness with 1.", "With these guidelines in mind, we can implement code that generates our dataset. The following code randomly generates 2000 cold, hot, and burning tea temperatures. Then 3000 slow and fast internet speed measures. Followed by another 3000 disliked and liked books. And finally, 500 unhappy and happy labels.", "A main concern when creating a dataset is to make it balanced. We have to ensure that each combination of features is equally represented. With one tea temperature, one internet speed and one kind of books, there are 12 possible combinations. We will create 500 instances for each combination. Then, depending on whether an instance has a majority of ideal attributes, we will assign the corresponding happiness label. Consequently, our dataset will have 4 columns of features, and 6000 rows of instances.", "The following code can be divided into two main parts: a vertical concatenation of columns, followed by a horizontal concatenation of rows. In the first part, the 12 combinations of features are created with 500 rows each. In the second part, a final concatenation of all the rows gives us a full dataset with 6000 rows. You can find the detailed implementation here.", "We will now split our dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The method train_test_split() from Scikit-learn will provide the added benefit of shuffling the rows of our data.", "To standardize our dataset, we will use the class StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. We have to be careful about only fitting StandardScaler on the training set. We also don\u2019t want to standardize our one-hot-encoded categorical columns. As a result, the following code standardizes the first two columns (tea temperature and internet speed). Then concatenates the standardized output with the two last columns (books and happiness).", "There are only a few steps left before we can consider our data fully prepared:", "We will begin by converting our data from NumPy arrays to PyTorch tensors. After this, we will use each tensor to create a TensorDataset. Finally, we will convert each TensorDataset to a DataLoader with specific sizes for the mini-batches.", "The Happiness in Confinement Dataset is now ready. And we are ready to finally meet the Confined Neural Network.", "The Confined Neural Network will have an input layer, followed by a linear layer and a ReLU activation, followed by another linear layer and a Softmax activation. The first output neuron will store the probability that the input describes an unhappy state. The second neuron will store the equivalent probability for the happy state.", "The following code implements this architecture as a class called Network:", "Note: You might have noticed that the Network class does not include any Softmax activation. The reason is that in PyTorch, CrossEntropyLoss starts by computing Softmax before computing its negative log loss. Which we address in the next section.", "Before we can proceed with training the neural network, we have to choose a learning rate and a number of epochs. We also have to define an optimization algorithm and a loss function. The loss function will be cross-entropy loss. And for now, we start with a stochastic gradient descent optimizer.", "Perhaps the most exciting part here is that we will visualize the training of our neural network using TensorBoard. As an avid PyTorch user, it came as great news for me to know that I can still take advantage of TensorBoard for visualization. Even greater was my excitement to learn that there is an extension of TensorBoard that integrates it within Colab notebooks.", "If you are interested in learning how to setup TensorBoard within a Colab notebook, I highly recommend you check the section titled TensorBoard in my notebook. The following code trains our neural network and visualizes the progress of the training and validation losses:", "You will notice in the code above that we are using an object called summary to call the method scalar. The basic idea behind using TensorBoard is to first specify some log directories. Inside those directories, we create the files that are going to be read by TensorBoard. These files are called summary file writers. In the code above, train_summary_writer and valid_summary_writer are both summary file writers. By calling the method scalar we are writing our loss values for each epoch inside the appropriate summary file. This file is then read by TensorBoard and conveniently displayed with an interactive interface.", "You can find the detailed implementation of these improvements here.", "In this section, we focus on evaluating our model using different metrics.", "Besides making predictions on the test set, we are also interested in checking our model\u2019s output and understanding what goes on under the hood. To achieve both goals, we implement the following steps:", "Our results look very promising. The first three predictions are correct, and the softmax probabilities show that the model is very confident about the correct output.", "More for the purpose of learning than actual need, let\u2019s plot the precision-recall curves for our classes. We apply the above steps for the rest of the test set, then we concatenate all the probabilities and all the predictions of each batch. With these probabilities and predictions, we can easily plot precision-recall curves for our classes with the method add_pr_curve. I relied on this official PyTorch tutorial for the implementation of the following plots:", "Once again, our results are ideal. We are getting the precision-recall curves of a perfect classifier. A kind reminder that this is a fun and feel-good project, and that the purpose here is to learn and practice while feeling entertained.", "It is already very insightful to compute a confusion matrix but we will go a little further. Our method will return the usual confusion matrix with true positive, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. In addition, it will also return the indices of the false cases for later inspection.", "To avoid overwhelming the article with code, here is a link to the implementation of the confusion matrix method. The output of the method is:", "From the results of the confusion matrix method, we can easily calculate the precision, recall, and accuracy of our neural network.", "We can only improve once we reflect upon our flaws. So it is interesting to look at the instances where the model made mistakes. We already have the indices of the incorrect cases. However, if we were to use them on the test set, we would get the standardized values, and we won\u2019t be able to draw any conclusions from looking at standardized data.", "We first need to convert instances back to their initial scale. Thankfully, Scikit-learn provides a method called inverse_transform for its StandardScaler. We will use this method to reverse the scaling back to normal.", "As we examine the false positives and false negatives, it becomes quickly evident that they are edge cases. In each instance, there was at least one attribute with a value close to the defined thresholds.", "In other instances, the decision of the neural network is skewed by an extreme value of the tea temperature. The combination of an internet speed that is just above the good threshold, a good book, but a very high or very low tea temperature, resulted in some unhappy predictions.", "We could argue that these are minor mistakes and that we have already reached excellent evaluation scores. But it would be a wrong and weak argument driven by the lassitude accumulated throughout our journey here. Ultimately, a model\u2019s worth is only truly evaluated on edge cases. To improve our model, we could train it using more edge cases. This, however, is only an iteration of what we already did. So I leave it to you as an exercise, if you would like to replicate and improve upon my work: join the happy playground.", "As for me, I stop here. Because although the neural network is still flawed, these are the kind of flaws to reflect upon. Flaws from which we can draw invaluable insights about ourselves, and how we take for granted what we have.", "\u201cLive with a steady superiority over life -don\u2019t be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn\u2019t last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing.\u201d \u2014 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn", "When was the last time you realized you have been mistakenly unhappy? Did it ever dawn upon you that although you barely had what you need, you had something, and that is plenty more than nothing? You would not want to fall into the sad predicament of the wrong pessimist. Just as much as you would not want to float away unawares with ignorant bliss.", "Life has to be about way more than happiness. We are beings aware of our mortality, prone to illness, subject to aging, exposed to the arbitrary whims of our circumstances. The pursuit has to be towards meaning rather than happiness. Meaning that sustains us throughout our hardships. Because we are also beings strong enough to bear our tragic conditions of existence.", "M. Amine. The Happiness in Confinement Colab Notebook.
