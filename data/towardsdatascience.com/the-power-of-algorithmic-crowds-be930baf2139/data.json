There\u2019s power in numbers, even for\u2026 | by Abhinav Raghunathan | Towards Data Science", "h1": "The power of algorithmic crowds.", "description": "One of the most fascinating historical examples of the power of crowds can be found within the pages of James Surowiecki\u2019s \u201cThe Wisdom of Crowds,\u201d in which a team of engineers, oceanographers\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud", "anchor_text": "credit card fraud data from Kaggle", "paragraph_index": 3}, {"url": "http://www.abhiraghunathan.com", "anchor_text": "www.abhiraghunathan.com", "paragraph_index": 16}], "all_paragraphs": ["One of the most fascinating historical examples of the power of crowds can be found within the pages of James Surowiecki\u2019s \u201cThe Wisdom of Crowds,\u201d in which a team of engineers, oceanographers, salvage crew members, and mathematicians were asked to make their best estimate on where a particular sunken submarine, the Scorpion, could be found (the Navy did not have the manpower to search the entire area and wanted a more specific guess). Individually, these guessers were wildly inaccurate, but the group\u2019s combined averaged guess was only 220m from the actual position of the sunken submarine!", "It has been shown repeatedly that the best way to arrive at an estimate is to ask lots of people from diverse backgrounds \u2014 the more diverse the better. How can we apply this sociological concept to machine learning?", "Ensemble models are just a conglomerate of models that are averaged to provide a \u201ccrowd\u2019s guess.\u201d Just as humans have bias, so too do models carry with them inherent assumptions and bias. Averaging these out across a few models is almost guaranteed to decrease error.", "For this example, I used some credit card fraud data from Kaggle. The first item of business was to pick an evaluation metric. I noticed that there was a huge imbalance of classes (99.8% of the data was marked as normal transaction volume, the other 0.2% were the fraudulent transactions), so the accuracy metric was out of the picture. For this type of problem, it\u2019s better to choose precision, recall, or F1 scores. For simplicity, I chose precision.", "After looking at the data a bit, I trained five models: a K-Nearest Neighbors, a Logistic Regression, a Random Forest, an XGBoost, and a Naive Bayes. The precisions I received after each one are shown in the chart below.", "Clearly, the Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers were not ideal, but the other three did quite well. Our maximum precision using an individual model would be 0.96. Keep that number in mind.", "One of the ways to turn these outputs into a \u201ccrowd-like\u201d format is to have each model vote based on what it received as an answer. Essentially, if the Random Forest algorithm predicted a 0, it will vote \u201c0.\u201d If all the other algorithms predicted a 1, they will all vote \u201c1.\u201d That means the ultimate tally is four 1\u2019s and one 0. In this case, the final output will be a 1.", "I used a \u201cweighted voting model\u201d in which the models that performed the best have the most votes. The chart below details how many votes I gave each algorithm.", "These numbers were determined from the relative precision of each model. Now let\u2019s have them vote!", "After running the voting method, I received the following results:", "This translates to a precision of 0.973! Notice that for this data, the false negative is the costliest outcome, since this means the transaction was fraudulent but our models predicted a normal transaction.", "Just to prove that the crowd is better than the individual, here\u2019s a chart of how many times each algorithm was correctly \u201coutvoted\u201d by the crowd (i.e. one algorithm voted incorrectly but the other algorithms voted correctly and hence \u201coutvoted\u201d the first).", "As expected, our Naive Bayes model was overriden the most number of times, but even the Random Forest was correctly outvoted 23 times by the other algorithms! The Naive Bayes model contributed to that outvoting as well, so it still is useful even if is not the best performer.", "The benefits of using an ensemble method include turning even bad models into important votes. This approach has very few drawbacks and should be an item in every data scientist\u2019s toolbox. Better results could be achieved with hyperparameter optimization, but I just used the stock models for this example.", "If you enjoyed this article, you can follow me for more content like this.
