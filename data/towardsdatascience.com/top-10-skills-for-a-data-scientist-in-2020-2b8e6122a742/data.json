Because I too worked to learn some of the skills for Data Science. As someone in the field of data, you would end up reading and knowing many, many things.", "Per my understanding, Data Science has always been about combining the tools best suited to get the job done. It is about the extraction of knowledge from data to answer a particular question. For me, putting it simply, data science is a power that allows businesses and stakeholders to make informed decisions and solve problems with data.", "Now, not every technologist is passionate about every other skill, but she would be excited about skills from her area of work. So are some of the skills for a Data Scientist. As we gear up for new technology trends and more significant challenges to solve in the new year, it is essential that we set our base strong.", "In no particular order, let\u2019s get to know the Top 10 Skills for a Data Scientist in 2020!", "Data Science is about using capital processes, algorithms, or systems to extract knowledge, insights, and make informed decisions from data. In that case, making inferences, estimating, or predicting form an important part of Data Science.", "Probability with the help of statistical methods helps make estimates for further analysis. Statistics is mostly dependent on the theory of probability. Putting it simply, both are intertwined.", "Especially for data-driven companies where stakeholders depend on data for decision making and design/evaluation of data models, probability and statistics are integral to Data Science.", "Most machine learning, invariably data science models, are built with several predictors or unknown variables. A knowledge of multivariate calculus is significant for building a machine learning model. Here are some of the topics of math you can be familiar with to work in Data Science:", "Linear Algebra for Data Science: Matrix algebra and eigenvalues", "Calculus for Data Science: Derivatives and gradients", "Gradient Descent from Scratch: Implement a neural network from scratch", "Of course! Data Science essentially is about programming. Programming Skills for Data Science brings together all the fundamental skills needed to transform raw data into actionable insights. While there is no specific rule about the selection of programming language, Python and R are the most favored ones.", "I\u2019m not a religious person about programming language preferences or platforms. Data Scientists choose a programming language that serves the need of a problem statement in hand. Python, however, seems to have become the closest thing to a lingua franca for data science.", "Read more about the Top 10 Python Libraries for Data Science here.", "In no particular order, here\u2019s a list of programming languages and some packages for Data Science to choose from:", "And, I am not writing What can you do with programming skills in Data Science \ud83d\ude1b", "Everything below down from here is about coding. Data Science, without familiarity with coding experience or knowledge, can be a bit difficult. I, therefore, prefer to brush up my Python skills first, read literature about the project I\u2019d be working and then start building up the code.", "Often the data a business acquires or receives is not ready for modeling. It is, therefore, imperative to understand and know how to deal with the imperfections in data.", "Data Wrangling is the process where you prepare your data for further analysis; transforming and mapping raw data from one form to another to prep up the data for insights. For data wrangling, you basically acquire data, combine relevant fields, and then cleanse the data.", "For me, data scientists are different people, master of all jacks. They have to know math, statistics, programming, data management, visualization, and what not to be a \u201cfull-stack\u201d data scientist.", "As I mentioned earlier, 80% of the work goes into preparing the data for processing in an industry setting. With heaps and large chunks of data to work on, it is quintessential that a data scientist knows how to manage that data.", "Database Management quintessentially consists of a group of programs that can edit, index, and manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts a request made for data from an application and instructs the OS to provide specific required data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users to store and retrieve data at any given point of time.", "Some of the popular DBMS include: MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, DynamoDB, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis)", "What does data visualization necessarily mean? For me, it is a graphical representation of the findings from the data under consideration. Visualizations effectively communicating and lead the exploration to the conclusion.", "I am a Data Visualization person at core. It gives me the power to craft a story from data and create a comprehensive presentation. Data Visualization is one of the more essential skills because it is not just about representing the final results, but also understand and learn the data and its vulnerability.", "It is always better to portray things visually; the real value is well-established and understood. When I create a visualization, I am sure to get meaningful information, which can be surprising out it holds power to influence the system.", "Histograms, Bar charts, Pie charts, Scatter plots, Line plots, Time series, Relationship maps, Heat maps, Geo Maps, 3-D Plots, and a long list of visualizations you can use for your data. For a more detailed list, visit here.", "Some of the popular Data Visualization tools include: Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView, Google Analytics (For Web), MS Excel, Plotly, Fusion Charts, SAS", "If you work with a company that manages and operates on vast amounts of data, where the decision-making process is data-centric, it may be the case that a demanded skill is Machine Learning. ML is a subset of the Data Science ecosystem, just like Statistics or Probability that contributes to the modeling of data and obtaining results.", "Machine Learning for Data Science includes algorithms that are central to ML; K-nearest neighbors, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Regression Models. PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras also find its usability in Machine Learning for Data Science", "The practice of data science often includes the use of cloud computing products and services to help data professionals access the resources needed to manage and process data. [customerthink.com] An everyday role of a Data Scientist generally includes analyzing and visualizing data that are stored in the cloud.", "You may have read that data science and cloud computing go hand in hand, typically because Cloud computing gives a hand to data scientists to use platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud that provides access to databases, frameworks, programming languages, and operational tools.", "Familiar with the fact that data science includes interaction with large volumes of data, given the size and the availability of tools and platforms, understanding the concept of cloud and cloud computing is not just a pertinent but critical skill for a data scientist.", "Some popular cloud platforms for Data Science include Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Cloud. I also read sometime back that people are now experimenting with Alibaba Cloud and that something sounds interesting to me.", "We know MS Excel as probably one of the best and most popular tools to work with data. We might be hearing, \u201cHey, did you receive the Excel boss sent? Wait, aren\u2019t we discussing skills for Data Science? Excel? I always wondered there must be some easy way to manage data. Over time, exploring Excel for data management, I realized, Excel is:", "Most non-technical people today often use Excel as a database replacement. It may be a wrong usage because it lacks version control, accuracy, reproductivity, or maintainability to some extent. However, what Excel can do is somewhat surprising as well!", "I\u2019ve always heard and believed that Data Science is for someone who knows mathematics, statistics, algorithms, and data management. Now, some time back, I met someone with 6+ years of experience in core DevOps looking for a career change to Data Science. A curious me looked in if and how DevOps can be a part of the Data Science. I don\u2019t know much (actually, anything) about DevOps, but one thing was for sure: The growing significance of DevOps for Data Science.", "DevOps is a set of methods that combines software development and IT operations that aims to shorten the development life cycle and provide uninterrupted delivery with high software quality.", "DevOps teams closely work with the development teams to manage the lifecycle of applications effectively.
