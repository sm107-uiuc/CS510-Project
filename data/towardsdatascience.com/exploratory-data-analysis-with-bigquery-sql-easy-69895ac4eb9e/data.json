Just add:", "Dynamic SQL in BigQuery simplifies and speeds up Exploratory Data Analysis", "This is to remove any values outside of the set boundaries.", "How to identify these boundaries? Well that\u2019s a good question. The first approach is to simply remove, for example, first 5 and the last 5 percentiles of your sample. The second thing we could do here is to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a given sample, then calculate the cut-off for identifying outliers as more than 3 standard deviations from the mean. Lastly you could simpy use your intuition and cut off the rows where you think the values are too high/low.", "Let\u2019s check outliers for estimated salary if it\u2019s more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.", "We can see that one salary [301348.88] is way higher than the others.

So simple select query will do the job:", "Or we could use dynamic SQL:", "Oh, hold on a sec, is it just one column? We can use dynamic SQL here to do it in one go for all of them:", "I think this is not the best way to do it though.

A severe imbalance of the classes can be challenging to model and may require the use of specialized techniques.", "Any dataset with an unequal class distribution is technically imbalanced. Performing this group analysis help us to understand the nature of imbalance and if there was any bias or collection errors.", "We can see that our dataset doesn\u2019t suffer from severe imbalance as all the features are distrubuted more or less equally across two main categories of exited.", "Let\u2019s see how it works and take a quick look into categorical variables we have, e.g. \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018country\u2019, \u2018owns_credit_card\u2019, \u2018is_active_member\u2019.", "Again, if you want to do these plots in Python you really need to know Python.

What if you just want to know which category of customers that churn is greater (e.g. female/male, which country or those are more active than the others)? It\u2019s a simple question and you don\u2019t need to be a data scientist to answer it.", "You can see that simple drag and drop does the same thing.

You can do all types of groupings and drill downs too.", "You can create interactive graphs and charts like a Data scientist! I think it\u2019s beautiful, especially when it\u2019s free.", "Me personally, I find it way quicker to create exploratory graphs with Seaborn or Matplotlib.", "Data Studio allows you to create a dashboard and forget about re-running your Python notebook if data in tables have changed.", "It will update the graphs itself.", "I like correlation matrix because it\u2019s a quick way to display relationshp between variables.", "Correlation is usually defined as a measure of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables (e.g., height and weight). The higher the weight more greater the affect on the target variable (if one change the other one will follow) and the higher the relationship between two of them.", "We can see that there is a positive correlation between Exited and Age and some negative correlation between Exited and isActiveMember. Also you can see how different features correlate with each other.", "Google BigQuery has done a great job on their statistical functions.", "Now when we have dynamic SQL in BigQuery we can have a correlation matrix same way Data scientists would normally do it in Python.", "Let\u2019s run a simple SQL query to check how CORR() funtion works in BigQuery:", "So we simply need to automate this function run for all the columns we have in the table (except those we want to exclude).", "In theory if there is a relationship between features you will be able to see it straight away from the graphs:", "Scatterplot is great way to visualize the realtionship between two variables, e.g. Age and Salary. It can be very useful and helps to quickly identify outliers. It will also show if a relationship exists or not.", "We can see that there is no visible correlation between CreditScore and Balance.", "There is a way to create scatterplots between all your variables in one go.", "Nothing shows up. Now let\u2019s see how to do the same in SQL.", "Let\u2019s go back to our Explore with Data Studio example. We will have to add scatterplots for our features one by one. Then just colour the bubbles by exited_category in any colour you like.", "Box plots are usful when we need to check a distribution of a variable", "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of a categorical variable. The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be \u201coutliers\u201d using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range.", "A box plot consist of 5 things.", "Nice and easy we can create automated box plots for each varibale:", "This helps to viasualise and explain the relationship between continuous variables and the target variable. You can see straight away that customers that churn are older than those who are retained. It also helps to compare median levels of each variable. For example, there is no difference in the median for credit score or tenure between lost and retained customers.", "Most of the customers who churn still have a significant balance in their bank account. Estimated salary and the number of products seem not to have any visible effect on customer churn.", "Let\u2019s see how to create box plot data in BigQuery. We need data first.", "You can now visualise it with Data Studio using a bar chart.", "At the moment when this article was written box plots didn\u2019t exist in Data Studio. It can be created with custom visualisations though. Let me know if you are interested and I will create one.", "We\u2019ll use histogram when we need to see the distribution of just one variable.", "If we need equal bucket we can simply do this.", "Click Explore with Data Studio and you can build a nice Histogram.", "After BigQuery announced dynamic SQL feature many things became possible. With that scripting ability we can now automate queries, perform Exploratory Data Analysis and visualise results in Data Studio.", "Python still remains a major tool for Data Scientists and provides great scripting features too. However, if we are talking about just getting the numbers BigQuery can do the same thing! When it comes to visualising the results Python definitelly helps to create grpahs quicker when Data Studio provides greater dashboarding experience. You can simply forget about rerunning the queries (or notebooks) when the dashboard is set up. So we just need to create it once.", "I hope you enjoyed the reading!", "Your home for data science.
