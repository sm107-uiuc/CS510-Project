It\u2019s considered a progressive country. People in Taiwan are able to criticize the president without fear, Taiwanese people elected their first female president in 2016, the Taiwanese congress (Legislative Yuan) passed a same-sex marriage law in May. However, Taiwan has a relatively short history of democracy.", "Taiwan\u2019s politics have mostly been dominated by the Kuomintang, or KMT, the Chinese Nationalist Party since 1948. The president was the leader of the party. In 1996 Taiwanese people elected the president of Taiwan for the first time. It has been only 23 years since Taiwanese\u2019s first vote for the president.", "After that first presidential election, another party \u2014 the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) emerged. By then, the politics in Taiwan is divided into two colors: blue and green. Blue stands for KMT and green stands for DPP. KMT leans towards People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) while DPP does not.", "The telephone survey data released by the Election Study Center of National Chengchi University revealed Taiwanese\u2019s party preferences between June 1992 to June 2019. KMT and DPP have been dominating the politics in Taiwan, but none of them ever win more than 50% party preferences according to the data.", "The data below focuses on the rising and falling fortunes of the KMT and DPP, between 1992 and to date. The visualization does not include data for other political parties and people who hold an independent stand and no response.", "The visualization shows when the KMT and DPP gained and lost support.", "In the first term of Lee\u2019s presidency, DPP just merged and there was no direct presidential election. It was not surprised that KMT had stable and higher approval rating from Taiwanese. The chart also indicates that, the percentage of people favoring DPP was growing steadily after the first direct presidential election.", "The election of Chen Shui-Bian of the DPP represented a Taiwanese milestone \u2014 he was the first president since 1948 who was not from the KMT. DPP won the election when KMT had a drop in the approval rating from 33.6% to 21.1%. One of the factors causing the decrease was the emergence of People First Party (PFP) which gained 9.1% of the preferences in 2000. PFP and KMT hold political positions.", "The preference rate of DPP was stable during Chen\u2019s first term, but decreased significantly during the second term. A series of DPP scandals led to a shift of preferences to the KMT. The failure of DPP also led to the election of Ma Ying-Jeou (KMT) in 2008.", "In 2008, KMT was back into power with a 35.5% of preferences according to the survey. By the last year of Ma\u2019s first term, the rate reached the peak at 39.5%. Ma was re-elected in 2012, but support slipped 17.4 percentage points by the end of his second term.", "In the second term of Ma\u2019s presidency, the student-lead \u201csunflower movement\u201d broke out in 2014. The activists occupied the Legislative Yuan as the protest against the passing of Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA, a treaty between PRC and Taiwan) without clause-by-clause review. This student movement did not directly cause the drop in KMT\u2019s approval rate, but helped DPP reached its highest percent of preference, 31.2%, the following year.", "In 2015, the year before the election, several rising stars in politics organized the New Power Party and attracted people\u2019s support from DPP. However, the DPP still won the race. But the party lost support over issues ranging from labor policies to a slow enactment of same-sex marriage legislation. DPP\u2019s preference rate decreased right after Tsai\u2019s election while previous presidents held stable ratings in their first term.", "In order to pull its ratings back and win the election for the next term, DPP pushed through same-sex marriage legislation that the Tsai had promised. The DPP\u2019s rating goes up a little bit in 2019, but the KMT is catching up in the meantime.", "With the recent protests in Hong Kong, the DPP might win more support from people. The race between DPP and KNT currently seems to be a toss-up, with the election in January 2020. It is unclear if Taiwan would become a (politically) blue or green island due to its complicated international and domestic affairs.", "Your home for data science.
