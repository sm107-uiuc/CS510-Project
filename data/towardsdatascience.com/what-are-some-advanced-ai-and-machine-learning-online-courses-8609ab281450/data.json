Where to find focused resources? Where to find somewhat advanced courses after basics have been mastered?", "In one of my previous articles on Medium (published by the TDS Team), I discussed, at length, where you can find MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) for jump-starting your journey into data science and machine learning. That article assumed the reader to be a beginner and covers essential MOOCs, which are optimized for basic and intermediate learning. You can check that one here,", "I wrote another detailed article specifically focused on the topic of mathematics concepts you need to master for data science and machine learning and which courses to study. You can check that one here,", "Recently, I have been receiving a lot of messages in my personal email and LinkedIn inbox, mostly from bright, young professionals, asking similar questions and my suggestions about online courses.", "I mostly have a ready answer for those messages. I just send them a list of my articles (which, in turn, contains links and references to other highly cited articles from KDnuggets or Team AV). In most cases, I receive happy replies :-)", "However, since writing those articles, I have personally taken few more \u2018advanced\u2019 courses in AI and machine learning (ML), seen discussions and reviews around few more, and naturally felt a need to update those references.", "After some thought, I decided it is best to leave the original articles, as they really cater to beginners and have served their purpose well for many readers, and try compiling a fresh list of online courses.", "That\u2019s what this article is about.", "Advanced\u2019 is a relative term. It is best to have a baseline to explain the word in this context. Fortunately, we almost have a gold standard when it comes to ML online MOOC \u2014 Prof. Andrew Ng\u2019s Coursera course (the original one, not the Deeplearning.ai specialization).", "Therefore, by \u2018advanced\u2019, in this article, I allude to two characteristics, which need to be present (not necessarily simultaneously) in the courses that will be discussed,", "I hope I make it clear that my intention is not to say that Prof. Ng\u2019s course is a rudimentary one. It is still the best introduction to the world of machine learning one can ask for \u2014 particularly for beginners. But, after you finish that course, do some programming, feel comfortable about the mathematics concepts, you should build on your base and learn diverse topics.", "I just hope that this article can help you do that by listing some free MOOCs with that singular focus.", "AI and ML are hot topics and there is no dearth of free online courses covering those subjects. Although, I have found that there are a surprisingly little amount of true high-quality AI courses out there.", "Yes, I am in that camp, which firmly believes that deep learning is not artificial intelligence, and therefore reject the notion of any course, having the word \u201cAI\u201d in its title but covering nothing more than deep learning frameworks in Python, to be classified as an AI course.", "So, to restrict my listing to a limited number of high-quality courses, I laid out some simple ground rule or filters.", "I believe this focus will automatically curate the list toward high-quality, foundational courses in AI and ML, which can benefit intermediate to advanced learners.", "You will be the judge, after all.", "Personally, I have not taken all of these courses although I finished a significant portion of them. So, I tried to keep my comments about the courses brief and factual.", "Without further delay, here is the list.", "These are courses covering general ML and DL topics.", "These are AI and game-theory related courses.", "Udacity\u2019s \u201cIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence\u201d course: The most comprehensive core AI course you will currently find on the web.

They cover topics like \u2014 AI search algorithms, planning, representational logic, probabilistic inference, machine learning, Markov processes, hidden Markov models (HMM) and filters, computer vision, robotics, and natural language processing.", "Columbia University\u2019s \u201cArtificial Intelligence (AI)\u201d course on edX: This is also a comprehensive review of essential topics in AI, but at a less rigorous level. This is a good introduction to the broad field of AI covering topics like \u2014 types and definition of intelligent agents, history of Artificial Intelligence, search, games, logic, constraint satisfaction problems, examples of AI applications in natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and computer vision.", "Stanford\u2019s \u201cGame Theory\u201d on Coursera: This is a great introduction (yet comprehensive) to the wonderful world of game theory covering all essential topics like \u2014 Nash equilibrium, Mixed strategy, Correlated Equilibrium, Subgame perfect, Extensive form, Repeated game and folk theorem, Bayesian game, Coalitional game.", "\u201cKnowledge-Based AI: Cognitive Systems\u201d by Georgia Tech on Udacity: A comprehensive course on the traditional AI (or as they call it GOFAI) covering topics like \u2014 semantic networks, means and end analysis, case-based reasoning, incremental concept learning, logic and planning, analogical reasoning, constraint propagation, and meta-reasoning.", "These are reinforcement learning related courses.", "Georgia Tech\u2019s \u201cReinforcement Learning\u201d course on Udacity: This is probably the most comprehensive RL course out there. Both instructors are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. The mode of delivery is conversational styled and fun. It covers the entire gamut of topics like \u2014 MDP basics, Temporal difference (TD) learning, value and policy iterations, Q-learning, convergence properties, reward shaping, Bandit problem, Rmax analysis, general stochastic MDPs, state generalization, POMDP, options, goal abstraction techniques, mechanism design, Monte Carlo tree search, DEC-POMDP, policy critic concepts, etc.", "\u201cPractical Reinforcement Learning\u201d, offered by National Research University Higher School of Economics on Coursera: This is another fantastically comprehensive course covering essential RL topics. The main difference from the Georgia Tech course is that it does not include game theory discussion and offers more discussion on Deep Q-learning instead. It is a more hands-on type of course teaching you practical tricks (but not necessarily full blown code) for building RL agents.", "Udacity\u2019s \u201cArtificial Intelligence for Robotics\u201d: This is a great little course specifically focused on application of AI to the field of robotics, taught by none other than Sebastian Thrun. He covers topics like \u2014 localization, Kalman filters, particle filters, advanced AI search techniques, PID control, SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping), etc.", "\u201cMathematics for Machine Learning Specialization\u201d by Imperial College, London on Coursera: A great specialization of four courses focusing exclusively on building the mathematical base for machine learning. It covers \u2014 multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and principal component analysis (a full short course on that).", "I hope to have given you some pointers on free online courses which cover somewhat advanced topics of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
