Which one should I use? Which one is faster? When do I use it?", "These are all good questions. I have asked myself the same when I first started. As I worked more with Power BI, I realized that they are quite different and work differently. It\u2019s helpful to know these differences sooner rather than later.", "How? To start, they are loaded differently in Power BI, they impact your visuals differently and also one works with row context while the other filter context.", "But before we get too deep into it, let\u2019s take a look at what exactly is each and we will walk through an example as well :)", "A calculated column is a column that is calculated row by row in data view. They take up computing space and increases file size. A calculated column should be done for data that are in considered to be in the \u201cslow changing\u201d category.", "A good example would be salary bracket. A person\u2019s salary will not change much from month to month, A salary bracket can mean whether they are in the low end, middle, or the higher salary band in comparison to the entire company.", "It may be important though, to see how individuals perform based on their salary bracket. This category cannot be in a measure because you can\u2019t filter a report base on a measure. This would be a good example to use as a calculated column. You can then filter your PBI report base on these brackets.", "Another good example would be work location \u2014 it will be important to see how each location perform according to location. You may have various cities you need to consolidate into regions and filter the report, so you will need a calculated column to do this.", "Here are two main questions to ask yourself if you should use a calculated column.", "2. Is this a \u201cslow changing\u201d field \u2014 for example, age, salary brackets or work location?", "If you have answered \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 you should probably build a calculated column.", "A measure is calculated on the spot based on user\u2019s interaction with the report. Results of measures are not loaded during refresh, rather, it is calculated on the spot. Uses CPU and does not increase file size.", "A good example of this would be the products sold, the products sold should be a measure and because it will be \u201csliced and diced\u201d by salary brackets and company location.", "Another example would be the employee social media activity scores ( A score based on how much they log on to a company\u2019s web forum, number of answers to the costumers. etc). You may want to see how active employees are on social media based on age categories and regions then compare against their performance. You can build a measure for that.", "Two main question to ask yourself if you want to build a measure.", "2. Will this data be aggregated, sliced somehow?", "If your answer is yes, you should build a measure.", "Let\u2019s walk through a simple example.", "Here I have a simple model, this database tracks sales by date, there are multiple sale staff IDs connected to the staff dimension table as a Many:1 relationship. The same with the Store and date table.", "Here, I want to filter products sold by employee salary. Should I use a measure?", "Well, it would be rather difficult. There are multiple salaries in the salary column. In a UX point of view, it would be very difficult for the end user to select multiple salaries just to filter the report. ( They have to select 55001, 55020, 56000 to get the range of 55000\u201356000 as an example). It would be better to create a salary bracket column to the filter the report. I will need to build a calculated column.", "I also want to filter by cities to see how employees perform. As there are multiple cities, it would be better to consolidate these into regions. I will also need to build a calculated column for this.", "You can build these columns by the binning function in Power BI or choose to build an conditional column in Power Query as well. The best practice really is to do this in Power Query, but sometimes you may want something quick, you can also do this in Power BI as a test. If this is something that will be kept in the end, you should do it on Power Query.", "Now what about be the measures in this model?", "Well, what do you want to report on? Think of the question \u2014 what are you going to aggregate? Here I need to compare the products sold based on regions, salary brackets etc. I will need to build a measure for this.", "If you need more information on getting started with power query, here is an article about it.", "Highlighted in green are calculated columns, highlighted in purple are columns to build measures on.", "In this model, I will now be able to filter on Salary Bracket, Regions and compare the measures of Product Sold and Activity Score.", "If you are still stuck and nothing makes sense, sit down and ask yourself this question.", "What do you want to report on and by what filters?", "If you can answer this basic question, you will have a general idea of what should be a measure and what are the calculated columns.", "Maybe I am over generalizing, but I have used this question to help me think through various Power BI reports and I hope it helps you too.", "Just remember, the key is having a good model, a model that makes sense, before you can decide on measures and calculated columns.", "Having a good model with save you from tons of headaches in the future! I\u2019ve been there burning the midnight oil and the model still doesn\u2019t work. Don\u2019t go down that route.", "Here is an article that may help you with the modelling part of it.", "Hope this helps and stay safe! :)", "Your home for data science.
