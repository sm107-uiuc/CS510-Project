If you haven\u2019t, then you may be in one of the ever-shrinking circle of industries that has yet to be upheavaled by digital disruption.", "A Citizen data scientist is a person who can use or generate models that utilise advanced diagnostic analytics or predictive and prescriptive capabilities. They often use automation tools such as Alteryx or Power BI, and can typically generate slightly more complex insights than your average data analyst.", "Citizen data scientists are an organisation\u2019s way of digitizing by upskilling their existing workforce to tap into the data the can usually be found lying around the organisation unused. Ernst & Young (EY) does this by providing employees access to a myriad of technology courses for free on Udemy.", "But is this enough? Can Citizen data scientists unlock the potential treasure trove of insights within organisations, having to be able to juggle between their day-to-day operations and practices, while trying to be more data-centered?", "The main difference between the Citizen data scientist and the Enterprise data scientist, is the focus and scope of work. Typically coming from an organizational or industrial background, the Enterprise data scientist has completely pivoted into the role of a data scientist. Their once industry or client-facing role since has since ceased, allowing them to focus primarily on data science and data engineering research and tasks.", "The Enterprise Data Scientist is a full-fledged data scientist, but coming from an organisational or industrial background with a different lens.", "Let\u2019s face it, the work of a data scientist is not easy. A large amount of time is spent in research and understanding the nature of the data, then testing and developing initial models, then refining and re-refining further. That is not all, the methodology must be carefully implemented, processes documented and findings recorded.", "This is done over and over again.", "After all, the backbone of science is built upon meticulous documentation and the ability to replicate results. We aren\u2019t interested in one-hit wonders.", "This isn\u2019t a luxury that Citizen data scientists have. Their bottom-line is still a delivery of a product or service, with technology merely as an enabler. There will be short-cuts and half-baked efforts, but it is still definitely better than doing things traditionally, without any technological enablement.", "Enterprise Data Scientists however fill-in this gap by positioning themselves internally, for example in an organization\u2019s R&D or Innovation department. There, they can work with Citizen data scientists on developing their initial ideas or prototypes into full-fledged applications or even software.", "I write this as an Enterprise Data Scientist myself. Previously coming from a client-facing role, I have since pivoted internally to focus on researching and developing data software and platforms for internal and commercial usage.", "The growing data needs of organizations and businesses have not gone on unnoticed. Some organizations have started taking strategic steps to further accelerate the digitization of work. Just recently both EY and IBM announced a global multi-year alliance that will undoubtedly benefit the clientele of both consulting practices.", "Aside from the commercial value-add, collaborations of this nature present rare opportunities for research and development, that would arguably drive a greater proportion of the value in the long run.", "EY is a multinational conglomerate with a business presence that spans all industries across the globe; while IBM Watson Group specialises in commercial and enterprise artificial intelligence and natural language.", "Watson has its own suite of services that readily enables day-to-day data science activities. Notably IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Data with a fully-integrated data platform that allows storage of assets, management of notebooks and provisioning of AI services. Most importantly, this provides an environment where Enterprise data scientists can directly collaborate with IBM\u2019s data experts on building models, applications and products.", "With the coming together of commercial data and intelligence, we are likely to see the next generation of intelligent \u2018artificial consultants\u2019 making a break in the industry. What a time to be an Enterprise data scientist!", "For the past couple years, my role as an Enterprise data scientist for EY, has had me working closely with IBM. Two organizations with two traditionally different business models, you can imagine that there would be a significant gap in the ways of working.", "However, I am here to share that the experience has been somewhat seamless, due to the way the roles for each team had been set up for the joint delivery of technology products. The illustration below is our typical data science team structure during the development setting of such products.", "The industry-native Enterprise data scientists (being the in-house data experts) should maintain the first point of contact with their external data science counterparts from the tech-native firm. They can be further assisted by data analysts or citizen data scientists who can perform simple data processes and analysis. Unlike the fully-dedicated Enterprise data scientists, Citizen data scientists usually serve a rotational role and are brought in to contribute specific insights gained from their specific domain.", "The enterprise data scientist is responsible for designing the overall data strategy for the organization given their understanding of domain knowledge and fluency with data architecture. This is communicated to the external tech-native data scientists, architects and engineers who can handle the pure technical aspects of the development.", "Because the Enterprise data scientists are industry/domain focused, they often have the most complete understanding of how data in their domain is expressed and the nuances of using them in modelling.", "Being a practitioner with 10 years of experience in say the Healthcare domain, does not mean you are an expert in healthcare data. The opposite is often true, where experienced domain practitioners can harbor biases based on their experience and are unable to view the data objectively.", "On the other end of the spectrum, non-domain-specific data scientists are equipped with statistical expertise and know-how in dealing with data. However an extensive amount of time is required to tune their expertise towards a new and complex domain that they have no experience in.", "By having internally-housed Enterprise data scientists, organizations save precious time and resources in bridging this wide gap.", "In the end, the successful collaboration between industry-native organisations and tech-native organisations hinges on the level of communication achieved.", "Any organization that has experienced rounds of digital restructuring understands that technological literacy is a real issue.", "Unless you work in technology, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to understand data processes. Likewise tech-natives have a hard time understanding domains that require decades of experience to master.", "Back to the function of bridging the gap, Enterprise data scientists serve as communicators, or as an additional layer of explainability. For the benefit of both industry-natives and tech-natives.", "From an industry perspective, they can capture and explain data in a way that makes sense to the business, thus driving easier adoption. From a technology perspective, they understand the architectural and engineering limitations, and can keep painfully unreasonable requests to a minimum.", "To seal the case on the need for Enterprise data scientists, consider this example:", "In the world of accounting, we have external auditors and internal accountants. Organisations would never hire a person that \u2018knows something about accounting\u2019 for the internal role; they will hire an actual accountant.", "Likewise in a future where technology and data takes center stage, organisations need to have in-house data science capability.", "Organisations need to have their own Enterprise Data Scientists.", "Share if you found this article useful! And let me know if you would like to see more stories from any of my experiments above.", "Your home for data science.
