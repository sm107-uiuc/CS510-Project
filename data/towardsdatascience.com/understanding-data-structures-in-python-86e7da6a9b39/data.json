Let\u2019s take a closer look at the functioning of lists, tuples / named tuples, sets and dictionaries. I don\u2019t plan to delve deeper, for example, on how to put or remove elements from a list. My goal is to show the operation of each collection in a simple and direct way, exemplifying their statements. At the end of each explanation, the main characteristics of each collection will be displayed. The examples will be made in the Python language, but as the focus is on concepts and not on the application, you can take this to your programming language which will probably work in a very similar way.", "Tuples are objects that can store a specific number of other objects in order. Once the elements are placed inside a tuple, they become immutable, meaning you will not be able to add, remove or move these elements at run time. The tuple, in turn, is used in most cases to store data, so its main function is to store different types of data in one place. Tuples are declared in two ways, whether they use parentheses or not (, and their items are separated by commas.", "An example of tuple with and without parentheses.", "In addition, we can add functions within a tuple such as:", "in this example, we need the parentheses, so the first argument of the function is our tuple, the second is a data and finally, we close the parentheses of the function so that our Python interpreter will know where the function begins and ends.", "Above we saw the use of tuples, but in some cases, we may want to access some of our keys individually, let\u2019s analyze the following example, where I want to represent the colors in RGB using a tuple.", "We can agree that the reading of this assignment is not entirely wrong. When reading this, I can understand exactly that when accessing the rgb_color [0] key, which in turn will return the value 55. By the description of the variable, I understand that the value 55 represented the RGD RED, but in most cases, this may not be as explicit, either due to the context being used or even due to the developer\u2019s experience. Exemplifying a better way to approach this situation using named tuples.", "The declaration of a named tuple resembles that of a conventional tuple, where, in our namedtuple, as the first argument we must inform our identifier and the second parameter strings separated by spaces or commas. The result is an object exactly with the identifier that was passed. That way we can unpack your values \u200b\u200bby accessing one of its attributes such as: cor.blue", "List is the conception of a sequence of several items, where, by necessity, you need to group them or place them sequentially. A feature of the list is if necessary we can access each position of our list individually, in Python it is declared between two brackets [], and its internal items are separated by a comma (,).", "You can populate your list with other types of data, in addition to what has been exemplified, such as objects, integers, tuples or even a list of lists. By definition we should always prioritize storing the same types of data in our list, if you feel the need to do this type of operation, maybe you should take a look at what the dictionary has to offer.", "You can see the Set as an extension of the list, where it should be used in cases where you want to store unique values, which the list does not give us natively. Its main feature is to store unique and unordered values. In Python at some point, you must have realized that everything is an object, and by default, our Sets only store the same copy of each object. Sets are declared by parentheses (), for their initial declaration.", "In the following example, we have a list, with a tuple of model and brand of cars:", "This result shows our unique car brands, and an important detail is that our Set does not return the result to us in the same order that it was inserted, just like a dictionary, set does not guarantee the order of its elements. A good use that we can make of Sets is the possibility of being able to see what is or is not in our Set.", "Based on my experience as a developer, dictionaries are the simplest and most efficient way to manipulate data with Python, given that your problem and your data are possible to work with a dictionary. Basically it is conscious in a key and value store, so the main objective of redis is to store information from key-value pairs, like for example: color = blue, where color is my key, blue is my value. Very similar to hash content, hashmap in other languages. In Python, it is declared between two braces {}, and its internal items are separated by a comma (,).", "Each collection that has been shown has its own character and each of them must be used in specific cases. The combination of their use gives us great flexibility to work with our data and makes our main objective, which is to solve real problems, really easier.", "If you want to understand more deeply or see different approaches, I made a small selection of articles on Medium that delve into this subject. Good Studies.", "Your home for data science.
