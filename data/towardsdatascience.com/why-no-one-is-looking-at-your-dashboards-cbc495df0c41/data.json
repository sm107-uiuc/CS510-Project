A dashboard should give you immediate feedback and empowers you to change your actions, but more often than not, dashboards we see nowadays are full of novelties and gimmick visuals that detract values from the practicality of a dashboard. Today I want to talk about what makes a dashboard great and highlight some common mistakes when creating dashboards and how we can avoid them.", "One of the most common dashboards is the one on the dash of a car. It is simple and yet effective, exactly what we need from a dashboard. There are a couple of reasons why it is so widely used and there is something that we can learn from when we are creating our digital equivalent.", "Dashboards should be intuitive to the audience and the content should be easily understandable without too many instructions. This is a lot like the way a car dashboard functions. The dashboard on a car shows the speed, RPM and fuel prominently as they are the most important information a driver should know when driving. Similarly, a great dashboard for your business should only show the important metrics and one that makes sense to people within the business.", "Dashboards are useful when they give you feedback on your actions. In a car, the speedometer tells the driver how fast he is going so he can adjust the speed, it is useful because it enables the audience to act on the information and provides relevant feedback. Similarly in business, it is important to show the audience metrics that they can influence and receive feedback as quickly as possible.", "Another feature on a car dashboard are the warning lights, they flash when there is something wrong with the vehicle that needs the driver\u2019s attention. They are a useful feature of a dashboard because during normal operations, they don\u2019t take up any of the user\u2019s attention and they only appear when they need to. Timely warnings are equally useful for businesses to make people aware of what is happening in the business when they need to.", "Here are some mistakes that are often made when we are creating dashboards.", "People only look at things that interest them and one of the most common problems with a dashboard is that it is showing information that is not relevant to the audience. It\u2019s tempting to build one dashboard for a number of purposes within your business but it just doesn\u2019t work. If you try to build a single dashboard that serves everyone, it ends up serving no one. When creating dashboards, we should first segment the audience into groups with homogeneous interests since they will be interested in the same set of information. You can use existing business units as a starting point but you might need to segment them further in the future. Once you have your audience in mind, try to understand what information they care about and what metrics they use to measure success. This step is easier said than done because not all organisations have a clear way to measure success but it is imperative that you help your audience identify the right metrics for them. Starting with the right metrics will ensure your audience is interested in what you are trying to show them.", "Back to the speedometer example, while it is useful to the driver, it is useless to a passenger. While he might be interested in the speed, he has no way of acting on that information. The same principle can be applied when we are creating dashboards. If your audiences can\u2019t action off the information received, they are unlikely to be interested in the dashboard. For example, profit is one of the most important metrics but because it is the result of a combination of actions, it is difficult for people to influence it directly. By breaking down profit into its components, you can start helping different people realise how they can all help contribute to the top line metric, e.g. having customer support focusing on retention, sales focusing on cost of customer acquisition, etc.", "The choice of metrics is crucial when it comes to building an effective dashboard. You want to make a dashboard that shows good performance and sometimes you are likely to fall into the trap of vanity metrics. Vanity metrics are ones that make people feel good but are not really actionable or crucial to the business. Metrics like total page views or apps download are examples of vanity metrics as they will always move up and to the right over time but it doesn\u2019t give people anything useful on how they are performing and what they can do to improve.", "People look at dashboards because they are dynamic and tell you how your business is doing from one day to the next, sometimes even from one second to the next. So when you are building your dashboard, you need to consider whether the information is suitable within the timeframe that people are looking at your dashboards. If your customer acquisition cycle is much longer than the frequency people look at the dashboard, information like customer demographics is useless because it will appear static and it is only taking up valuable space and attention. While this static information is important for a contextual reason, they should be set aside from the day to day dashboard.", "While it\u2019s tempting to use fancy graphics and new charts to bring something different to your dashboards, they don\u2019t necessarily convey the information with the same effectiveness when compared against more traditional visualisations. Visual design also plays a big role in this area, the use of spacing, colour, shapes and other visual elements all help to convey the message you intended to show your users. So next time when you are creating a new dashboard, stick to the simple charts that convey the message. The quicker your audience get the information they need, the quicker they can make adjustments to what they are doing.", "At the end of the day, there is no perfect dashboard because things change constantly, whether it is your business priorities, your audience interest, or even your skills. We need to recognise that dashboards are merely a tool that we can use to align understanding and standardise how metrics are measured, they are not meant to be a static thing that we build once and follow it blindly. We should regularly reassess whether they are useful for the audience because the value of dashboards lies in the actions that it inspires. Remember, a dashboard is meant to tell you objectively how your business is performing, there will be times where the metrics are not looking good, but that is precisely why you have a dashboard. You would never want a car that doesn\u2019t tell you when you are speeding, so why would you want a dashboard that doesn\u2019t tell you when your results are not as expected.", "If you have enjoyed my content, sign up for more at https://jchoi.solutions/subscribe", "Your home for data science.
