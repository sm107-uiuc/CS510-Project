The real estate industry is being hit by the coronavirus, and it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. The effects on real estate will vary by sector and market, and the extent of the effects will depend upon the duration of the economic shutdown.", "The sectors of real estate that have been hit hardest so far are hotels, restaurants, bars and other entertainment destinations followed closely by retail and housing.", "In this project we will be investigating the trend of residential real estate sector in Milan, Italy, before and after the coronavirus outbreak, in particular before and after Feb 21st. The residential sector focuses on the buying, selling and rental of properties used as homes or for non-professional purposes. The residential real estate sector is comprised of single-family homes, apartments, condominiums, planned unit developments, and more.", "We will be scrapping the data from kijiji.it for all the available renting apartments offerings or postings on the platform from January 1st until April 15th. kijiji is an online advertising service fully owned subsidiary of eBay launched in February 2005. Kijiji websites are available for more than 100 cities in Canada and Italy.", "Note: If you are interested in the code, please visit my profile on github.", "We managed to collect 461 properties for rental purposes. First thing we had to do is to clean the data, we can remove any values without prices and any values before the month of January. We will also remove the euro sign and anything that prevent the columns from being considered as a number and not a text.", "Now it\u2019s time to work on the outliers, using the Interquartile Range Rule, we were able to remove 25 values in total.", "Now before splitting the data set to before and after coronavirus outbreak, let\u2019s first do some data exploring on the whole dataset so we can be familiar with what we have first.", "The average price for all the apartments are 955 while 26% correlation between the price and area is actually not that good, and it\u2019s worth investigating.", "We can notice that the most expensive areas are (Bonola / Molino Dorino / Lampugnano) (San Siro / Fiera) while the cheapest ones are (Citt\u00e0 Studi / Lambrate) and very strangely (Centro), that will be under investigation in the next step when we split the data.", "#Note: the milano area is based on user submission of not specifying the zone which automatically assigned to the municipality name.", "We have 85 online rent postings before the outbreak while strangely we have more than triple the number after for the same time period. Which can indicate a huge drop in sales.", "Average prices before the outbreak are higher, as expected.", "Let\u2019s check and print the correlation and explain it.", "A positive relationship exists with 55% correlation between prices and areas before the outbreak while on the other hand it\u2019s almost zero after the outbreak, which suggests that people\u2019s pricing behaviors have changed. It\u2019s also worth to mention that 55% correlation between price and area is not that strong and it shows how in a lot of tenants can be charged for a lot more than what they get, it\u2019s also worth mentioning that house prices don\u2019t only depend on those features.", "Here we can clearly see the change in trends, before the outbreak prices in the center was the highest along with San Siro area (~1200), however after the outbreak the prices dropped to almost half in the center and Loreto area to reach ~600 with small to medium drops in other areas, however we can notice an increase in the prices in areas like Bonola / Molino Dorino / Lampugnano.", "It should be normal to have the same price for the same features in the same location like what we see in (Baggio / Forze Armate / Quinto Romano) or in the center, however there are a lot of variations in the prices in areas like (Porta Genova / Navigli / Corso Italia) or (San Siro / Fiera), that\u2019s definitely explains the low correlation number from before, and we should expect higher variations in the after data.", "As expected, prices disruption, can be due to fear from the country lockdown as workers stay home, and due to business shutdowns, quarantines and curfews. Huge numbers of layoffs will lead to further contraction in consumer spending, which will force landlords to decrease their prices, some has already started to adapt to the new situation and some are still offering the same normal prices, having in mind also that the market for short-term renting is slowing down massively.", "In this part we will try to divide the market into distinct subsets of apartments based on their area and price.", "We will use a method called, MinMaxScaler(feature_range = (0, 1)) will transform each value in the column proportionally within the range [0,1]. We use this as the first scaler choice to transform a feature, as it will preserve the shape of the dataset (no distortion).", "Cluster 0: prices(1500\u20132250)\u20ac, area(60\u2013105)mq, this cluster has small apartments with high prices, those usually are concentrated in expensive neighborhood or in the center.", "Cluster 1: prices(625\u20131500)\u20ac, area(35\u201386)mq, this is the medium cluster, you can have small apartments with higher prices than cluster 3 for the sake of a better neighborhood.", "Cluster 3: prices(375\u20131100)\u20ac, area(20\u201370)mq, this cluster has also a positive relationship, small apartments with low price range, that is usually in areas far from the center.", "Clusters are as before only here we can see each cluster contains postings in which areas in the city, cluster 0 as predicted has apartments in the center, we can also assume from this results that the Milano segment is associated with the center and expensive neighborhoods.", "Cluster 0: prices(100\u20131000)\u20ac, area(20\u201370)mq, this cluster has small apartments with very low price range, that is usually in areas far from the center.", "Cluster 1: prices(100\u20131000)\u20ac, area(80\u2013125)mq, this cluster has bigger apartments with the same low price range from before, which indicates that maybe some apartments had to lower their range of prices after the outbreak.", "Cluster 2: prices(750\u20131500)\u20ac, area(40\u201386)mq, this is the medium cluster, you can have small apartments with higher prices than cluster 3 for the sake of a better neighborhoods.", "Cluster 3: prices(1200\u20132250)\u20ac, area(55\u2013150)mq, this cluster has big range from small apartments to bigger ones, however with high prices, those usually are concentrated in expensive neighborhoods or in the center.", "In this last representation, cluster 3 as shown before has the highest prices, however, the prices are not the center anymore as before the outbreak, they are in areas like Bicocca and Citta Studi, concentrated near universities, while the center prices has shown a huge drop.", "We will be taking the original dataframe after fixing the date column and we will manually insert the coordinates from google maps, then we will delete unidentified places \u2018~Altre zone\u2019.", "First, for the data from before", "First for the data from before the outbreak.", "Second for the data from after the outbreak.", "We can notice the price range went down in comparison from the dataset before the outbreak, 500\u20ac drop shows the fall in prices, and maybe its not as big as the drop in sales.", "Our data and our analysis showed that the market behaviour has definitely changed, some landlords has already started to lower their renting price for their apartments, the data also showed that the number of postings after the outbreak is triple the number before which indicated a huge drop in sales.", "Property renting and buying platform Idealista.com reported in early April that the effects of the coronavirus crisis have yet to be noticed on the market, although they warned the next quarter will probably shed more light on the situation.", "According to their data from the first quarter of 2020, house prices across Italy dropped by 0.4 percent, with the average price for second-hand properties now standing at \u20ac1,699 per square meter (annual decrease of 2 percent).", "If you like the idea of investigating the market trends, having more features of each apartment is definitely recommended, playing with dummy variables to turn the location to a measurable variable can be an interesting idea, collecting more data after couple of month to have a deeper look is also recommended.", "If you want to view the full code and to know how to scrape the data yourself or to download the dataset in this project, check out my profile on github.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
