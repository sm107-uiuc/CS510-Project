How much does Numpy\u2019s linear algebra\u2026 | by Emma Boudreau | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Is NumPy Faster Than Python?", "description": "A few days ago, I wrote an article where I objectively compared the current state of Julia and Python, and even tested some basic iterative performance between the two languages. While Python was\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["A few days ago, I wrote an article where I objectively compared the current state of Julia and Python, and even tested some basic iterative performance between the two languages. While Python was certainly out-paced by Julia, it was impressive to see how well Python held up against Julia, with Python usually coming in just behind Julia when working with smaller datasets. When the number of observations was increased, however, Python\u2019s speed shortcomings seemed to grow exponentially. You can find a link to that article here:", "One thing that is great about publishing your work publicly, is that it can be basically peer-reviewed by the entire internet. While this might open the door for some rather rude individuals to mess with you, it also allows for like-minded scientists to communicate ideas. There was a great response left on this story constructively criticizing my test because I wrote my own functions for element-wise multiplication and element-wise exponents. To be clear, my goal was to compare the raw power of the two languages not to show that you could write this algorithm faster in one or the other, but it was instead to show that it can be far easier to write back-end code with Julia, as apposed to switching to C because of the short-comings on Python.", "Of course, rather than using my own functions, most Python programmers would prefer I not reinvent the wheel but make it square and would much prefer that I just use NumPy. However, to give an accurate test of Pythonic performance compared to Julian performance without C, I refrained from using C.", "This thought got me quite curious, however. Looking on Github, NumPy is about 51-percent C. So obviously in a lot of cases NumPy would beat out any operation we could make in Python. What is up in the air about this is just how big of a performance gain we could expect from such a thing. Additionally, there is a chance that relatively basic linear algebra functions in NumPy, like numpy.multiply(), are written in Python, and don\u2019t even take advantage of C.", "The first way I would like to test this is by using the same method that I used prior in that other article. I will be using a 10,000,000 dim data-set, and attempting to predict with a simple linear regression model using both NumPy functions that are likely in C, and my own Pythonic functions. Here is the class written using my own functions:", "And here is that same class written using NumPy functions:", "The two Numpy functions used are square() and multiply(). These functions are relatively simple, as I showed in my examples of the functions, so I am really curious to see if there is C involved to speed them up. Before we can get to speed testing, we will need to read in some data:", "Now we\u2019ll time that with our self-made functions as a baseline:", "While 8.22 certainly isn\u2019t bad, it could be better. Julia does this calculation in below one second, so it will be pretty interesting to see how the combination of C and Python stacks up against Julia, as well:", "It looks like the comment left on my article was right about one thing; NumPy and C is a lot faster for linear algebra. I had a suspicion that NumPy might retain pure Python code for this action, but it is clear here that I am wrong. I think it\u2019s also important to remind ourselves that NumPy likely also has its own types and iterators that are written in C, as well. This is certainly very cool, as it means that NumPy is relatively blazing fast.", "NumPy is a lot faster than Python. While this was to be expected, I would be lying if I said I expected this massive of a performance gain from using NumPy as apposed to Pythonic functions to accomplish my goals. I think this is also somewhat of an homage to the amazing work that has been done on the NumPy package for the sake of science and math in Python. Currently, NumPy sits just over 23,000 commits on Github, and that\u2019s a lot of free and open-source, selfless work done for the community!", "Overall, I think it is really cool that Python can be sped up so much by using a large C base. After all, Python was created primarily for end-users to interact with low-level applications similar to how they would in ABC. I\u2019m glad that I got this reply and was able to investigate this further and learn more about the kind-of performance benefits that come along with using NumPy. Thank you all very much for reading, and thank you for providing constructive feedback like the reply that spawned this article.", "Your home for data science.
