While I\u2019d love to train neural networks all day, it\u2019s critical that we build solid relationships with our business units and find ways to deliver easily understandable and quantifiable value.", "Unless you\u2019re working for a big tech company, chances are that your team has plenty of use cases for analytics. In this short tutorial, I\u2019m going to give you the code and overview of how you can leverage basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) to deliver real, communicable, valuable analytics.", "For tutorials on gathering requisite text data from the internet (and some warnings) check out my articles on web crawling:", "Part 1 for complete beginners can be found here and part 2, where we take a more object oriented and reusable approach can be found here.", "Dataset can be found here (there\u2019s a link in the code as well).", "The corpus is the core data structure we will work with for NLP. Since we\u2019re passing a character vector to the Corpus() function, we need to specify that the source is a vector source. Using the inspect() method will allow you to take a look at the newly created Corpus.", "Following the creation of the corpus, we clean up the text data using some common methods. Our cleaner() function does some basic manipulations like removing numbers, but it also removes all stop words, which are words that have little to no meaning on their own. Popular stop words are \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca.\u201d", "Note that there may be some information loss when removing stop words. This is where analysis becomes more art than science. You may opt to just remove basic ones, you may decide to remove industry specific terms, etc.", "When we created our Corpus, R basically coded every review as a separate text document. A Term Document Matrix (TDM) takes a corpus and makes a vectorized frequency table of every single word. Here\u2019s an example of 3 dummy reviews made into a TDM:", "From this TDM, we can create a matrix, sort it by row sums (word frequency) then visualize the results using a word cloud. This is the first part of our analysis.", "The word cloud is a good start, but it is a very basic starting point. We can enhance our analysis by evaluating correlations between words. Word correlations leverage the same methodology that R\u2019s base cor() function uses, with Pearson correlation being the default. Here\u2019s the Pearson correlation formula:", "Since our TDM is vectorized, R can perform these comparisons efficiently. In our master code, we need to enter a term of interest and a lower correlation bound. Don\u2019t be surprised if you see most word correlations falling under ~15%. In fact, 15% could be a significant correlation because of the sheer size of our datasets. Even with our tiny (by ML standards) dataset, our TDM is very large (23M elements \u2014 3107 reviews x 750 words).", "Let\u2019s look at a correlation graph between the word \u201cPain\u201d and the rest of our TDM, imposing a lower correlation bound of 18%:", "The graph shows us a few insights right away. For example, we see \u201cnerve\u201d has a high correlation with pain with a correlation of 22%. This can have direct, immediate business impact; we have efficiently summarized over 3,000 reviews and pulled a common ailment.", "While there are many complex ways to perform sentiment analysis, we will focus on reasonably performing, out of the box methods in this article. For a detailed overview of sentiment analysis, check out this Wikipedia page. For a quick startup, we essentially leverage huge lists of pre-labeled negative / positive words from Microsoft\u2019s sentiment lexicon. We left join the lexicon with our list of words and then just calculate ratios of positive:negative words.", "But wait, there\u2019s more! While we can take a closer look into individual word frequencies, this is ostensibly a bar graph / table form of what we visualized in our word cloud. Single words also suffer from missing information. Similar to what we saw in our discussion of stop words, we can lose important qualifiers in a sentence with this approach. For example, we can have \u201cfan\u201d be one of our top words, but maybe half of the sentences also include \u201cI was not a\u2026\u201d", "We can counter this loss of information with N-gram analysis. An N-gram is basically \u201cN\u201d words that co-occur in our dataset. All we need to do in this code template is change the \u201cn\u201d in our method to the size we want. Here are the results after running a Bigram and Trigram analysis and cleaning our datasets.", "There are a few great advantages of this code template, both technical and non-technical:", "4. No Analytics Infrastructure? No Problem! This template can be recycled for any text analysis with little to no user interaction. Infrastructure helps but isn\u2019t really necessary. If we wanted to do a \u2018soft deploy\u2019 of this type of code:", "Your home for data science.
