Ethics concern a set of social conventions that develop \u201cour capacity to think critically about moral values and direct our actions in terms of such values\u201d.[i] What is the specificity of digital ethics, and how do these considerations differ from those of ethics in general? These concerns are more a question of degree than of kind, for each new generation of information technology introduces increasingly salient challenges for humanity. In this brief contribution, we survey the origins of four key questions that help frame the current debate.", "Coming out of the second world war, Norbert Wiener\u2019s work on cybernetics focused on the question of to what extent humanity can trust automation. During his work on antimissile communication systems, Wiener becomes intrigued by the interdependence between systems of communication and control in both humans and machines. Although he was a strong advocate of developing automation, his writing in The Human Use of Human Beings expressed growing concerns about the dehumanization and subordination of our species. He outlined, in particular, the dangers of trusting decisions to computer programs that cannot reason abstractly, and by consequence are highly unlikely to understand the nature of human values.", "Does information technology create new ethical issues?", "Thirty years later, Walter Maner, a medical professor and researcher coined the term \u201ccomputer ethics \u201cto describe the ethical problems \u201caggravated, transformed or created by computer technology\u201d. In focusing on the specificity of the ethical decisions that arise from the use of computer technology, he argued that computer applications were fundamentally different than previous technological innovations in that their design, complexity, and malleability allowed them to be applied in a countless number of domains. He suggested that the resulting ethical decisions often had to make in policy vacuums whenever government and society feel behind technological innovation. He further argued the nature and the scope of ethical dilemmas were often distorted when discussing computer technology. He concluded that the involvement of computers in human conduct can create entirely new ethical issues.", "Can technology be programmed to emulate humanity?", "Is information technology by nature ethically neutral, or does its use inherently produce ethical consequences? In his seminal article in forty years ago, \u201cWhat is Computer Ethics?\u201d, James Moor summed up his thoughts concerning the ethical footprint of technology. He suggested that at the minimum, computers were ethical impact agents for programs and algorithms have challenge human nature whether this was intended or not. He foresaw that computers could be programmed to be implicit ethical agents, in other words humanity could choose to regulate information technology to avoid unethical outcomes. He also evoked the more challenging possibility of creating computers as explicit ethical agents using algorithms programmed to act ethically. Finally, he envisioned a world of full- ethical agents in which machines would be capable of elucidating ethical choices compatible with humanity.", "Are digital ethics today a proxy for moral conduct?", "If artificial intelligence is all about context, how does context influence our views of ethics? Krystyna G\u00f3rniak-Kocikowska\u2019s major contribution to the ethics debate is referred to as the G\u00f3rniak hypothesis: computer ethics is the future of applied ethics and will soon become the foundations of global ethical systems.[v] Gorniak argued that ethical considerations have in the past reflected local experiences, histories, and customs, which in turn explains why ethical positions often vary from one culture to another. She suggested that computer ethics are not bound by local constraints, i.e. computer logic constitutes a truly universal view of how humans and machines can interact. She concludes that the pervasiveness of automation would lead to \u201ccomputer ethics\u201d becoming a proxy for ethics as the foundation for moral conduct in the information age. Although the G\u00f3rniak hypothesis has been contested by authors such as Deborah Johnson, computer ethics is undeniably tied to the evolution of global business, education, and legislation.", "Framing the current debate over digital ethics", "The discussion of digital ethics today takes each of these arguments one step further. The debate goes beyond the ethical consequences of computers and automation to the ethics of data-driven decision-making. The ethical challenges do not arise simply from the quality and the relevance of the data itself, but from how human beings use data to perceive, predict, and evaluate courses of action. Each new generation of information technology enlarges the objectives and application areas of both human and artificial intelligence, and in doing so modifies the context in which ethical choices arise. The finality of digital ethics is not a question of separating right from wrong, but of constructing appropriate frameworks for both developers and end-users of digital technologies to qualify acceptable data practices.", "Dr. Lee Schlenker is a Professor of Business Analytics and Digital Transformation, and a Principal in the Business Analytics Institute http://baieurope.com.
