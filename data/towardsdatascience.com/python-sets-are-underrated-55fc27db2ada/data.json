Recently I have gained an appreciation for sets, thanks to a project that required lots of text processing and checking if certain words occur in certain texts. I wish I had explored them earlier! Let\u2019s start with a quick overview of what sets are.", "There are two key differences between a Python list and a set:", "There are also many similarities between Python lists and sets:", "It\u2019s easy to make and use sets:", "Let\u2019s now go over some common and helpful use cases for sets.", "By converting it to a set and then back to a list, you can remove duplicates.", "You can use this to quickly get the total vocabulary of a text or to get all the unique characters used in a document. This can be very helpful in the preprocessing stage of a machine learning or NLP task. Of course, this also works with data types besides text, including numbers and immutable objects.", "The following are three important operations that can be done with sets:", "These operations are best understood using Venn diagrams. In each of the following figures, the top circle is A and the bottom circle is B. The green area represents the set that results from each operation.", "Intersection. Let\u2019s say you want to know which words are shared in common between two texts. This corresponds to the left figure above, in which we select just the overlapping portions of the sets. Python sets make it easy to create vocabulary sets for two (or more) texts, and then calculate the intersection, as shown in the code below.", "Note the similarity between the & operator and the logical and operator && in many languages. You can remember this, since this operator only chooses items that are present in set A and in set B. As an alternative to the & operator, the .intersection() method can be called, as in the following example:", "Union. This operation merges two sets. It corresponds to the center figure above, in which we choose the total area covered by both sets together. Following the fundamental property of sets, duplicates will not be stored. We could use this to find, for example, all the unique words that appear in two (or more) different books.", "Note the similarity between the | operator and the logical or operator || in many languages. You can remember this, since this operator chooses items that are present in set A or in set B. As an alternative to the | operator, the .union() method can be called.", "Difference. This operation removes elements of one set if they also belong to the other set. It corresponds to the right figure above. Unlike the previous two operations, set difference is not commutative, so A - B is not the same as B - A. Can you explain in words what the following code does?", "Answer: the code prints words in the first file that are not present in the second file. This could be useful, as one example, when analyzing performance for language models on out-of-vocabulary words. As an alternative to the - operator, the .difference() method can be called.", "Chaining operations. Multiple operations can be chained together, like so:", "Additional operations. There are additional operations that check if one set is a (strict) superset or (strict) subset of another, using the following operators: >, >=, <, <= . I am not going to go into too much detail on these, because you can actually implement these operations using the three operations we have already discussed. For more information, check out the Python documentation on sets.", "It is very fast to check membership of an element in a set. This is because the underlying data structure of a Python set is a hash table, making them similar to Python dictionaries, just with keys only instead of key-value pairs. A lot of algorithms that would take linear time for a Python list would take near-constant time for a set.", "On the surface, using a list and a set to check membership might look pretty much identical:", "However, if there are thousands or millions of items in my_set and my_list, then we will start to notice differences. The following plot shows the results of some experiments I ran to compare membership check time for lists and sets. As the size of a list or set gets bigger, the difference in time between lists and sets grows. For applications where you will be repeatedly looking up whether an item exists or has been seen before, consider using a set rather than a list.", "There are lots of situations in which sets can make your life easier or speed up a computation. In addition, there is something very satisfyingly Pythonic about removing duplicates from a list using list(set(my_list)) or performing one-line set operations without needing to resort to for loops. This is not an exhaustive list of set applications, so feel free to leave a comment if you think I left out any other uses of sets!", "Your home for data science.
