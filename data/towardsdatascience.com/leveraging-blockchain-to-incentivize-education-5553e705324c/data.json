Don\u2019t believe me? I can prove it.", "If you were a traveller, you would know that it\u2019s a pretty common occurrence to see small children at the outskirts of tourist attractions selling souvenirs. Sometimes the vendor kids get aggressive, even if they don\u2019t speak your language. And they\u2019re all so cute that you\u2019re tempted to give in and buy something\u2026but you don\u2019t \u2014 maybe because you have no real need for those souvenirs, or maybe because your tour guide tells you not to.", "A lot of people are guilty of this; I\u2019ll admit I am too. Back in December, I took a trip to Cambodia where we visited lots and lots of temples and saw a ton of cute adorable children selling trinkets, mostly at Angkor Wat. I don\u2019t know about you, but I always feel bad when I ignore them, but that\u2019s what our guide told us to do. So we did, but it didn\u2019t sit well with me at all (understatement of the year), since I recognize that I\u2019m in a place of privilege and doing absolutely nothing to address bridging the inequality in opportunity that was smacking me in the face \u2014 really hard.", "When I started really think about what was actually going on, it was then I realized: the Cambodian children were selling souvenirs instead of going to school. Their families valued short-term monetary incentives over long-term educations for their children.", "The cycle of poverty is then perpetrated, and nobody is doing anything about it. The kids and parents are making money to support their families, and the tourists can buy souvenirs, so a lot of people don\u2019t actually see this as an issue. But the truth is, they can\u2019t escape the poverty because of their day \u2018jobs\u2019 as street vendors.", "As tourists, we walk by without a second thought, but there\u2019s actually a fundamental flaw in the way this world works.", "The massive increase in tourism in Siem Reap has indirectly caused a decrease in school enrolment because there is more short term monetary gain in selling to tourists than attending school.", "How do we break this cycle? The answer is education. You can see how the rates of education see an exponential decrease as the level of education increases. It\u2019s pretty high for primary school because they don\u2019t have the linguistic/intra-personal skillset for this, and once they mature and develop, they drop out.", "If you didn\u2019t know, blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where digital information (including tokens) can be distributed and stored. It can be thought of as a massive database where everybody can see all activity, and nobody can control anybody else. Probably the most important aspect is the fact that they have no central authority in the system, so there can\u2019t be any corruption, and all logs are completely transparent, to be stored forever.", "Hold up\u2026 what is going on? Let\u2019s unpack this.", "How does this system actually work, who participates, and how do they participate?", "Basically, there are 3 main participants: miners, nodes, and users \u2014 without them, the system would not work.", "When users send transactions, they are accessed by the miners. Miners compete to solve complex math problems (decode hash functions) in order to create a block. These hash functions take forever to decode, so the miners end up doing a guess-and-check. The blocks contain a series of transactions which are put together by the miner as a reward for decoding the hash.", "Why would the miners want to spend all their time decoding hash functions? Well, there\u2019s actually an incentive to this \u2014 miners are rewarded in Ethereum (ETH) for creating the block (right now, it\u2019s around 2 ETH, which is approximately $300) on top of the transaction fees that the users pay. They could also create empty blocks so they get the 2 ETH regardless, but it\u2019s more economically rewarding to have a full block.", "When the transactions are added to the block, the block is added to the chain \u2014 hence \u2018block-chain\u2019. The nodes receive the series of transactions, and the state of the digital ledger is updated. And voil\u00e0!", "Learn more about our project on our website, linked here.", "How does blockchain relate to kids\u2019 lack of education in Cambodia?", "TL;DR: We tokenized the Cambodian education system with cryptocurrencies to incentivize education.", "The value of what they receive (in the form of the CamboCoin (CCO) token) is of higher value than the money they make as vendors. This virtual currency could be used to purchase extra alimentation, healthcare benefits and financial aid in exchange with partnered organizations. The more the student attends school, the more CCOs would be awarded to the student. When exchanged, they are eliminated from circulation.", "They get tokens for going to school, and we have also automated a system to track and record students\u2019 participation in school \u2014 their attendance is taken via biometrics, clocking in and out at a certain time, but ensuring they stay for a minimum amount of time before claiming a reward.", "While CCOs are awarded to students for attendance, KnowledgeCoins (KNC) are credential tokens, providing even more opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth to pursue barrier breaking education.", "There are two main objectives in relation to education:", "From least CCOs per day to most:", "Primary School \u2192 Middle School \u2192 High School/Secondary School", "One of blockchain\u2019s biggest advantages is its decentralization. Smart Contracts utilize this technology to effectively facilitate, verify, and enforce an agreement made between parties. Our system is comprised of two smart contracts, one for each token.", "Our first contract manages CamboCoin. These tokens are minted and distributed to students who attend school. When these tokens are claimed by families, they are burned from our total supply in order to regulate their circulation.", "Here\u2019s an extract of the CCO smart contract code:", "Another aspect that\u2019s important is dealing with the actual transactions. This requires a transaction fee, which is paid in ETH. You can make a donation or a contribution to the accounts as well. Users can claim amounts of their tokens for reward.", "The full code can be found here.", "Here\u2019s a little preview of the interface and how to review immutable information from their accounts. The existing data cannot be edited, and there is no reverse function for actions.", "*Note: for the sake of the preview, this is a simplified interface and not actually what it looks like! But its purpose is just to give an idea of what we\u2019re working with in addition to the website.", "Integration and technology is important, sure, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t have a purpose. Basically, you have to know your why. Innovating for the sake of innovating \u2014 who\u2019s she?", "Personal experiences and my travels definitely shaped my \u2018why\u2019. But even more than that, I want to do good in the world. The best way to do this is to frame this whole idea through the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. So we focussed on quality education, economic growth, no poverty, and reduced inequalities.", "Obviously it doesn\u2019t stop there. Scalability is a huge part of our project, and we want to evaluate ways that we would expand it to more rural parts of Cambodia, and even further from there.", "The end goal of our project is education \u2014 blockchain just happens to be a way that can facilitate this process. As a student, creating equal opportunity is really important to me, as it is to the rest of our team. Education has the power to dramatically change the path of a child\u2019s life: from a street vendor to a tour guide. A huge focus of ours was breaking the cycle of poverty with this project, which has the potential to impact millions of lives.", "This project was created in collaboration with Martin Thaw, Willis Guo, Mahitaj Rashid, Nicholas Chan, and Sean Huang.", "Huge thanks to Blockscale Solutions, the Blockchain Learning Group, Adam, Erik, Mr. Zagabe, Mr. Tarle, and Mur for mentoring us throughout this process.", "Let me know what you think!", "Follow me on Linkedin and Medium for more.", "Your home for data science.
