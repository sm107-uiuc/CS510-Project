This library is essential for data scientists who use python. Some other essential libraries like Pandas, Scipy are built on the Numpy library. So I decided to make a cheat sheet. Here I included all the Numpy functions that I used so far. And I believe these functions will be enough for you to do your job in your everyday work life as a data scientist or a data analyst.", "I will start with the very basic Numpy functions slowly moved towards the more advanced ones. But using Numpy is easy. You will not find any complicated coding trick here.", "In Numpy documentation, Numpy is defined like this:", "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.", "I use this library every day. Most data scientists do if they are python users. It is fast, easy to use, understandable, uncomplicated. I don\u2019t want to write too much about how and why it is so good. Because you will see it for yourself as you read through this article.", "My goal is to document Numpy\u2019s every day used methods.", "As the title says, it is a guide to Numpy. It can be used as a cheat sheet as well. If you use the Numpy library or planning to use in the future, or trying to learn, this page can be a great resource for your everyday life.", "These are the topics that will be covered here:", "I used a Jupyter Notebook for this whole exercise. First import Numpy.", "Make a Numpy array. To do that we need to pass a Python list.", "In the array \u2018a\u2019 I used all the integers. Now, make an array of floats:", "Let\u2019s try to make an array with both ints and floats:", "Notice, Numpy automatically converted the integers into floats!", "Find out the dimensions of array a and b:", "Array \u2018a\u2019 is a one-dimensional array and array b is a two-dimensional array.", "Now, find the shape of the array \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019:", "Array \u2018a\u2019 is a one-dimensional array. So, it has only one value in shape. But array \u2018b\u2019 is a two-dimensional array. So, it\u2019s shape is 2 x 3. That means it has 2 rows and 3 columns.", "Find the length of the arrays:", "Array \u2018a\u2019 has length 3 because it has 3 elements in it. Array \u2018b\u2019 is a two-dimensional array. So, the length of the array does not mean the number of elements in it. The length means the number of one-dimensional arrays in it or the number of rows in it. It has two rows. So, the length is 2.", "There are a few different ways to repeat the elements of an array. If you want to repeat the whole array,", "Here is how to do the elementwise repetition,", "This time each element was repeated 3 times.", "Let\u2019s use this for a two-dimensional array,", "Here, we mentioned axis = 0. So, the repetition occurred in the axis-0 direction or rows direction.", "Axis 1 indicates the direction of columns. So, repetition happens in the column\u2019s direction.", "In this section, I am going to show the mathematical operations. Most of the operations are self-explanatory. I will start with mathematical operations on one array.", "It adds 2 to each element of the array.", "You can simply use similar operations this way such as:", "Two asterisks mean exponents. Each element in \u2018a\u2019 is squared.", "We can also perform some trigonometric operations:", "Now see how we can do some mathematical operation in two arrays or matrices. First, make one more array,", "Just as a reminder, our array \u2018a\u2019 looked like this:", "Now, we have two arrays, a and b. Let\u2019s do the same mathematical operations. Again, it\u2019s simple and self-explanatory,", "In the same way, you can do these following operations:", "What is a.dot(b)? It\u2019s element-wise multiplication and then addition like this,", "You can write the syntax a bit differently as well,", "This works the same. The output will be 50.", "We can use this dot process in multi-dimensional arrays. Let\u2019s make two multi-dimensional arrays for that,", "We are ready for a \u2018dot\u2019 operation on a multi-dimensional array,", "When the inputs are 2D array, \u2018dot\u2019 function behaves like matrix multiplication.", "That means you can only perform the \u2018dot\u2019 operation when the number of columns of the first array matches the number of rows in the second array.", "If the first array is m x n, the second array should be n x p.", "\u2018np.matmul\u2019 does not work in one-dimensional arrays", "Remember, this multiplication rule does not apply in other operations such as addition, deduction or division. We need to have the arrays of same shape and size to add, subtract or divide one matrix by another.", "Numpy has basic statistical operations as well. Here are some examples.", "There are two other very useful functions which are not exactly statistical,", "\u2018argmin()\u2019 gives you the index of the minimum element of the array and \u2018argmax()\u2019 returns the index of the maximum value of the array.", "The minimum element of the array \u2018x\u2019 is -3 and the maximum element of array \u2018x\u2019 is 6. Now check if their index matches the result.", "There are so many different ways in Numpy to initialize an array. Here I am going to discuss some commonly used ways:", "This is the way to initialize a sequence of numbers. Notice it starts from zero and ends at 9. The upper range is always excluded. Here the upper limit is 10. So, it stops at 9.", "We also can add a mathematical operation to it:", "In this case, we asked for a range of 10 square and we got the square of 0 to 9 in the output array.", "We can make an array of the sequence of numbers with certain intervals.", "Here, 0 is the lower limit, 15 is the upper limit and 3 is the interval.", "There is another method that gives a sequence a bit differently:", "Here, 0 is the lower limit, 3 is the upper limit and 15 is the number of elements. In this case, Numpy automatically generates 15 elements equally spaced from 0 to 3.", "There are a few other types of arrays:", "You can initiate a three-dimensional array of ones:", "There is another method called full_like that replaces the elements of an array:", "There is another type of matrix called the identity matrix:", "It\u2019s a five by five matrix where all the elements are 0s and only diagonal elements are ones.", "There is another type called an \u2018eye\u2019. It takes the shape of a matrix:", "These diagonal numbers can be different than ones.", "There are different ways to rearrange or reshape an array.", "Let\u2019s learn it by example. First, make an array,", "I explained the \u2018arange\u2019 function in the previous section. Let\u2019s see how we can reshape it.", "We passed (3,5). So, it becomes a two-dimensional array that has 3 rows and 5 columns. We could achieve the same by using:", "What if we want to get back to the original one-dimensional array?", "Look, We got back the original array!", "Notice another thing. That is we changed the dimension of the array. Array \u2018x\u2019 was a one-dimensional array. We made it a two-dimensional array by reshaping it.", "Now, make another array to understand it better. Here is another example.", "This time I will use resize. Reshape will do the same. Just to practice with resize, let\u2019s use resize here.", "Look we provided (3,1) as the parameter of resizing. So it made 3 rows and 1 column. It\u2019s a 3x1 matrix. We can have a 1x3 matrix as well.", "Look originally c was a one-dimensional array. Now it\u2019s a two-dimensional array or matrix.", "Do not think that you can only reshape a resize a one-dimensional array only. You can do so in a higher dimensional array as well.", "You can achieve this using \u2018resize\u2019 as I mentioned before. There is another way,", "Looks confusing? Imagine, you have a huge big array or dataset. Before reshaping, you only know one dimension. So, in the reshape method you pass that one dimension and for the other dimension use -1. That way Numpy itself will figure out the other dimension.", "In the example above, I passed the first dimension that is 4. That means I am telling Numpy to make 4 rows. And I do not know the number of columns. So I just passed -1 there. So, it automatically knows to make 2 columns.", "This is a very useful trick when we work with a big dataset or dataframe and we have to build machine learning algorithms.", "In all the examples above we saw how to reshape and change the dimensions.", "This is the way to alter the dimensions. The array \u2018y\u2019 above is a 4x2 matrix. Let\u2019s make it a 2x4 matrix again.", "This method is called the transpose. When you use transpose on an array or matrix it just alters the dimensions. 2x3 matrix becomes 3x2, 3x6 matrix becomes 6x3 or 1x3 matrix becomes 3x1.", "Indexing and slicing is a very common and everyday task. Let\u2019s work on a few examples:", "a[0] gives the first element of the array. In the same way, we can keep going with a[1], a[2], and all the way up to the entire array.", "We can cut a slice as well,", "This is the explanation. We passed [1:5]. So, the slice will start at index 1 and ends before index 5. Remember, the lower bound is included and the upper bound is excluded.", "I am not going any deeper about slicing and indexing in this article. Because I already wrote another article where I explained it in detail. Please check. It is important to learn it well.", "Numpy has a few different methods to add rows or columns. First I will start some stacking techniques. Here are some examples.", "This time I will work with some list or arrays. Numpy will automatically turn them into arrays while stacking.", "You can stack them as many times as you want.", "Let\u2019s do some stacking horizontally as well. We need arrays with the same number of rows.", "\u2018x1\u2019 has 2 rows. Make an array out of it.", "Another way of adding columns or rows. But as opposed to stacking, this time we need to have two arrays of the same dimensions. Remember, when we did vertical stacking we had a two-dimensional and a one-dimensional list.", "Here are my two lists for this example.", "Now, concatenate horizontally. But we need two arrays with the same number of rows.", "You probably know by name what these operations are about.", "We did not mention any axis in those examples. So, by default, they took axis 1 or in the column direction or horizontal direction. Now, do an append operation in a vertical direction.", "This time we will insert an element in a certain position. Start with a new array.", "Insert element 5 at the beginning of the array.", "First, understand the input. In (a, 0, 5), a is the array, 0 is the position where we wanted the element to be inserted and 5 is the element that was to be inserted.", "Notice, how the insertion happened. First, the two-dimensional array \u2018a\u2019 got flattened into a one-dimensional array. And then 5 was added at the index 0.", "We can insert along the axis as well.", "Look a column of 5s is added to array \u2018a\u2019. We can add a row of 5s as well.", "I will make a new array as before.", "Like insert operation, delete operation also flattens the array. In the input [1,2,5] is the list of indexes where we wanted the delete. To see it clearly, let\u2019s flatten the original array \u2018a\u2019.", "Now check, the elements of index 1, 2, and 5 were deleted.", "Like insertion, we can delete a specific row or column.", "In the input (a, 1, 1), a is the array, 1 is the column\u2019s index that we want to delete, and the last 1 is the axis.", "Look, it sorted in both directions. We can specify axis and sort in a specific axis.", "When the axis is None, it flattens the array and sort. Now, sort in axis 0 and 1.", "It does exactly how it sounds like. Flips the arrays and rows.", "Now, flip this array in the direction of axis 0 and 1.", "Numpy has excellent functionalities for random number generation. They are very useful in machine learning, research, or statistics. Here are some examples.", "It generates a number between 0 to 1. We can get an array or matrix out of random numbers like this.", "It does not have to be the numbers from 0 to 1. We can generate random integers.", "It generated a random number in the range of 0 to 25. We can specify how many numbers we want to generate.", "Here, we are asking Numpy to generate 10 numbers in the range of 1 to 100.", "Now, generate a 3x3 matrix in the range of 1 to 100.", "Instead of a range, you can provide an array and ask Numpy to make a 3x3 matrix using the numbers from the array you provided.", "Another useful functionality is \u2018shuffle\u2019. Let\u2019s make a new array and shuffle it.", "Look, we have the same elements, just rearranged after shuffling.", "We can save the array \u2018arr\u2019 in a file.", "Here, we are making a file named \u2018arrfile\u2019 to save the array \u2018arr\u2019. The file will be saved with an extension of \u2018.npy\u2019.", "We can load that file and bring back to further use the array like this,", "We can import a CSV file or text file using Numpy as an array. I have a file named \u2018Cartwheeldata.csv\u2019 in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook I worked on these examples. Now, import that file here.", "I am showing the part of the array here. Because the file is big. So, here is the information on that file.", "These types of arrays are very useful in machine learning.", "This was all the Numpy functionalities I wanted to share in this article.
