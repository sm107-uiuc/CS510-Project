I got my hands on 2018\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad", "anchor_text": "Kickstarter page", "paragraph_index": 1}], "all_paragraphs": ["I didn\u2019t realize the tables/tibbles would be poorly shaped after importing from R directly to Medium. If anyone has ever faced this, please drop a link for me to refer to!", "I got my hands on 2018 January Kickstarter data-set from Kaggle. To the uninitiated, that is, if you have been living under a rock, Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform for projects. So you post what project you want to realize, it can be an art project, music, film, new gadgets, art, food recipe, video games, and much more. Hell there was even once a guy who set up a Kickstarter page to help him make potato salad. Dude got USD 55,000 when he said he only needed USD 10 all for some potato salad.", "So people post what kind of stuff they want to make, details of the project, set a funding goal, and get people to \u201cpledge\u201d to their project. Kickstarter follows an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d funding scheme, meaning if by the funding deadline your project hasn\u2019t hit the goal yet, all the money pledged will be returned to contributors. Usually the deadline is either 30 or 60 days. But if you do hit your funding goal, you keep the money but Kickstarter keeps a 5% cut.", "So today we are going to try to answer, or question some more, several points:", "We begin by getting an idea about the data-set we are facing with. We have data of about 378,000 projects from March 2009 to March 2018 (incidentally Kickstarter was launched in April 2009, but whatever).", "Lo and behold, the raw data (named \u201cks\u201d):", "Since we wanted to look what kind of projects get funded and what kind of project fail, it makes sense to first store new variables to split between failing and successful projects.", "We see that for most project categories, the success rate would be less than 50%. Below is a more detailed number on that. We create new variables counting how many projects are in each category, and how many projects fail in each category, and simply divide them to find the fail rate.", "Turns out, journalism themed projects fail a lot. and at the opposite side we got dance categorized projects failing the least. Both have relatively small count of projects proposed. Why? Mayhaps it has got something to do with the funding goals? Are people deterred by projects with big funding goals? Or are projects with small amount of funding goal deemed not ambitious enough? Is funding goals the answer? We are going to take a sample of 1% of the population.", "Turns out it isn\u2019t. It only shows that there ARE some crazy ambitious projects (which failed or cancelled) but funding goals does not seem to really affect success. Makes sense. Perhaps we need a closer look.", "See, most of the successfully funded projects are at the lower end of the funding goal. as opposed to other states (fail) which distributes quite nicely. Does this imply that lower funding goals signifies better calculated projects or just that, it is easier to fund? Perhaps we ought to see how far are they from their funding goals?", "I added a column called \u201cfailhard\u201d to show how far a project is from being funded by dividing amount pledged, and amount of goal. But it didn\u2019t show here.", "We added a new column to calculate the completion percentage of the project\u2019s funding goal. This way, we can gauge how far are they from getting funded.", "Most projects fail not even passing the 25% mark. Can we conclude that it is not the funding goal that is too big, or the time limit for funding as set by Kickstarter is too small? Perhaps it is simply that the projects are not that interesting.", "All in all we can conclude that a fail rate of 60%, frankly, is pretty low! I initially thought only a very small fraction of projects would be successfully funded. Turns out 40% of them hit the funding goal. Projects either got funded, or fall very far from the goal. Showing it\u2019s still a hit or miss, but hey, 40% chance of funding is pretty big if you ask me.", "And we\u2019ll continue another time. This is after all, my first rodeo with the R.", "Your home for data science.
