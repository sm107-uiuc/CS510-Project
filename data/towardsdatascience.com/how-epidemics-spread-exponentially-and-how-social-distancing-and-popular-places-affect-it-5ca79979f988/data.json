We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions in less than half a year. What started in a city has been declared as a pandemic by WHO. The virus spreads exponentially and doubles every few days, that is without any preventive measures.", "This exponential growth is scary but it can be slowed down if people practice \u201csocial distancing\u201d and other lockdown measures. To understand the importance of these actions, the spread of such disease in a hypothetical city will be simulated here. The spread of the disease will be modeled through a SIR model over a geometric region divided into various communities. People can travel between such communities and their movement will be controlled using a transition probability matrix. The idea of the people movement is based on the first-order Markov chain and the movement will only depend on their current location. By updating the transition probabilities, we will simulate different experiments.", "The SIR model is one of the most studied and robust compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments: S(t) for the number of susceptible, I(t) for the number of infectious, and R(t) for the number of removed (recovered, deceased, or immune) individuals at a given time t. SIR model is dynamic in the sense that the count of individuals in the three states changes over time. We will model the SIR without vital dynamics, that is, no birth or death other than from the disease itself is considered, making the total population constant. One idea behind this is that the dynamics of disease like COVID- 19 is much faster than the dynamics of birth and death.", "The SIR model can be defined as the set of three Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE):", "Where, s(t), i(t), and r(t) are the susceptible, infected, and removed a fraction of the population at time t. b is the infection rate and k is the recovery rate. One thing to note is that since we are modeling without vital dynamics, the sum of three ODE is 0 representing no new addition or deletion of the population from outside", "Before we move forward, we will have to estimate the values of infection and recovery rate. We can do this by doing a grid-search over the two parameters to find the optimal values which minimize the RMSE between modeled and actual counts of both the infectious and removed states. Let\u2019s make some assumptions first:", "Both the error in the infectious and recovered state will be given equal weights while calculating RMSE", "Based on the above points we can conclude that the estimated rates can be considered for our study.", "In the following experiments, simulations will be performed in a city that is divided into 400 communities (in a 20 * 20 grid). Each individual will belong to one community (we can call it his home location) and can move to other communities based on some probabilities. These transition probabilities will be calculated as follows:", "For example, for one of individual living in the community (marked with red border), we have the following transition probabilities (each cell represents one community):", "In this experiment, we will see how the disease will spread if no preventive measure is taken and all the individuals are allowed to travel without any restriction. (To learn how to create the below animation check out the following article \u2014 Animate any plots in R using gifski )", "Without any restriction, 90% of people got infected in 200 days with maximum active cases of 2,437 on day 103. The graph reached its first plateau around day 50. After day 75 the slope again started increasing and peaked at day 103. In the right animation, we can see that the highly infected regions reached the diagonal of the city grid and a new infection hotspot was created on the bottom right corner around day 100.", "In this experiment, people remain in their home community with a probability of 0.25 and therefore, simulating a situation where 25% movement is restricted.", "In this case, the 88% population still got infected. But the peak of infection reached 13 days later and the plot was flatter by a small amount.", "In this experiment, people remain in their home community with a probability of 0.50 and therefore, simulating a situation where 50% movement is restricted.", "With a 50% lockdown, we were able to reduce the impact of the disease and only 49% of the population got infected in 200 days. The maximum active cases in a day also reduced to only 1,053 and occurred on day 146 (while in experiment 1 it happened on day 103). We can say that restricting the movement by half, significantly helped in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.", "In this experiment, people remain in their home community with a probability of 0.75 and therefore, simulating a situation where 75% movement is restricted.", "75% lockdown significantly reduced the spread of the disease. In 200 days only 30% population got infected and infection peaked with a value of only 470 at 147th day (44 days later than without lockdown case). We can also see in the heatmap animation, that the spread is very slow. Compared to the 100th day for no lockdown, 75% lockdown has very little spread on the 100th day with infections confined in a small area in the center-left part. Since 100% of full lockdown is not possible, we can stop our lockdown analysis at 75%.", "With this analysis, we can conclude that a small amount of lockdown (25%) will only reduce the impact of disease by a small amount. But as we increase the lockdown to above 50%, the effect will be significant in Flattening the curve.", "In this experiment, we will see how the presence of a popular place like supermarkets, shopping malls, etc. affects the spread of the disease. We will add one such place in the center of the city which will be visited by everyone once a week.", "Having a popular place which is visited by everyone enabled the easy transfer of virus to all the parts of the city. Because of this, the peak of infections reached much earlier (on 66th day) with a higher active cases count of 3,255 (for experiment 1, the peak reached on 102th day with active cases of 2,437).", "In the right heatmap, we can also see that the center community (which has the popular place) got highlighted at the very beginning itself which helped in spreading the virus to different parts. On the 100th day, the spread crossed the diagonal part of the city (while in all the previous experiments spread never crossed the diagonal on day 100).", "In this experiment, we will put the popular place (which aided in spreading the disease) on lockdown, and see how it affects the spread. This means no one is allowed to go to the popular place. Otherwise, all people are free to move to other communities.", "The grey cell in the center shows the popular place with 0 population in any of the three states. The result was almost similar to that of experiment 1, with a marginal reduction in total infections.", "In this experiment, we will only allow the people to visit the popular place and all other movements are restricted.", "This time the infection was very low. Since everyone was only allowed to move to one place and that too even with a low probability, the disease was well contained.", "In this experiment, two cities are connected via a single route. Infection was started in City 1 and slowly it spread to City 2. The transition probability matrix was created as follows:", "We started the infection from the City 1 which spread to the City 2. We can see that City 1 has the infection peak earlier with the highest active cases of 4,786. City 2 got a peak 40 days after City 1 as it took some time for the virus to reach there. The magnitude of disease was also low with a more flatten curve in the City 2 and the spread was more gradual. Since there was a single source of disease in City 2 and it was connected to all parts of the city, the disease was more evenly spread throughout the city as compared to City 1 which shows a \u2018wave\u2019 like phenomenon.", "Without claiming an accurate epidemic modeling, our aim in this was to get an insight into how different measures and people\u2019s movements affect the spread of an infectious disease like COVID-19. While travel restriction on small scale didn\u2019t provide many benefits, 50% and above restrictions slowed down the spread significantly and made the curve flatter. This means that if anyone who gets sick with COVID-19 and requires hospitalization will have access to a bed and proper treatment. This can be one temporary measure to curb the pandemic while more durable solutions are implemented.", "The source code can be found in my Github", "Your home for data science.
