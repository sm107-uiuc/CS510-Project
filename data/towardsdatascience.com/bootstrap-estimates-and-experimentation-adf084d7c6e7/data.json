However, there are certain metrics that are not so easy. Take, for example, an experiment designed to increase tax collections, or to pay an invoice. If all the invoices were either fully paid, or not paid at all, this could be analyzed with a binomial proportion test or a chi-squared test. However, a certain fraction of the invoices will be partially paid, making these tests unsuitable. Even if we tried to compare the actual bill distributions, these are likely to be some form of exponential distribution with many small bills and fewer large bills, as shown below.", "So what to do? One way to handle this is to use random sampling statistical tools, often referred to as Monte Carlo Simulations. Two that are particularly relevant in assessing the results of an experiment are bootstrapping (which is useful for determining the distribution of a statistical parameter like the mean) and permutation testing (used to determine if there is a difference in a statistic between two distributions, and how likely that difference is to be real as opposed to by chance). In this post we will deal with bootstrapping.", "Bootstrapping uses the concept of sampling-with-replacement to generate the distribution of a parameter. To illustrate this, let\u2019s say we want to estimate the average height of twenty flowers. Without access to a computer, we would go about this as follows:", "And now for the fun and (slightly) magical part\u2026", "If you repeat the above 1000 times, you will end up with 1000 slightly different estimates for the average- and those estimates will be:", "In (very unoptimized but perhaps more readable?!) Python we can do the above as follows:", "As a sanity check, it\u2019s worth comparing the bootstrapped standard error with the standard error we would expect from a normal distribution using frequentist methods. The standard error of the mean (SE) for a normal distribution with standard deviation \u03c3, and sample size N, is given below:", "We can compare the above to our bootstrapped estimate by using:", "I hear some of you muttering in the background- big deal! We could have done this without all this random choice nonsense\u2026.", "BUT\u2026 what if (instead of flowers) we had some other sample that wasn\u2019t normally distributed? What about bills which typically have some sort of exponential distribution?", "What is the mean of the bills shown below? More importantly for experimentation (where we\u2019re trying to determine if there is a difference between two means or other statistical parameter) what is the standard error on that mean estimate ?", "That's a bit more tricky isn\u2019t it\u2026", "Let's try estimating this using a bootstrap technique, but this time let\u2019s tidy things up a bit and use a function\u2026", "Great! But what does this mean for experimentation? Well, for experiments we would like to convince ourselves that the intervention has actually had an effect. For example, imagine we ran an experiment that was designed to increase the average repayment? How would we know it had worked? We could compare the bootstrapped mean distributions as below:", "And then compare the two histograms as done below (where A and B are experiment arms A and B respectively):", "A great thing, is that we can now use a t-test to compare the two mean distributions", "For the above we get a p~0 i.e. there is a nearly zero percent probability that the means of the two samples are the same. If these were representative of two experimental conditions, we could safely assume that there is a difference between them.", "This is a VERY powerful technique- it can be used to estimate the standard error of any statistical parameter no matter what the underlying data distribution. Also, the resulting estimate is normally distributed, making it easy to compare using standard frequentist techniques.", "In the next post I will describe permutation tests.
