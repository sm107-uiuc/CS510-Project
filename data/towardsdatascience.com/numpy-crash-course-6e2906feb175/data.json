NumPy is used for numerical processing. Keep in mind that some basic Python knowledge is required. I recommend that you follow along with a jupyter notebook so that you can see the output of the code and also experiment using different inputs.", "In this article you will learn how to:", "From an N-dimensional array how to:", "Along the way, we will see some tips and tricks you can use to make coding more efficient and easy.", "I hope you will enjoy it \ud83d\ude42", "First do pip install numpy, then import it in your Jupyter-notebook:", "Quick note: In each block of code, you see both the code and the output. You can also check my GitHub repository here if you want to download the Jupiter-notebook.", "Creating arrays can be done using a list, or built-in functions. Let\u2019s see how each of them works.", "We can create an array using a list.", "and then convert it to a numpy array.", "Numpy has many built-in functions that provide a fast and efficient way to create arrays.", "To see all available functions, type the name of your array and then press tab.", "Imagine you want to create an array of size 5 which has numbers from 0 to 4. We could do it like this:", "But let\u2019s say that we need to create an array of size 100 which has all the numbers from 0 to 99. It would probably be very painful to do this using the previous method. This is where arange comes to save the day.", "Here we simply need to specify the starting point, and the endpoint (note that the endpoint will not be included in the array).", "We can also specify a step size. Let\u2019s say we want every second element of this array, we can simply do this by adding the step size in the arange function:", "Linspace takes as input a starting point, an endpoint, and the number of points evenly spaced between them which also indicates the length of the array.", "Here the starting point is 1 and the endpoint is 10. Linspace creates an array with 5 evenly spaced numbers between the start and endpoint.", "What if we don\u2019t care about what numbers our array will have? Well, we simply put random numbers there, right? The random.randint function does exactly that.", "It takes as inputs a starting point, an endpoint (which is not included in the array), and a size of the shape (no worries, we will look into it in a bit).", "Ok but now I want to generate the same random numbers with you! How can we do it?", "Simple, we use a seed! If you type in one cell:", "we will get the same random numbers!", "What if we need a sample of size 100 from the Gaussian distribution, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1? Well, we use again .random but here instead of .randint we use .normal!", "Type ?np.random.normal and you will get informations about how to use this function. This helps a lot if you don\u2019t want to remember what inputs each function needs and what the function returns.", "Let\u2019s check if the mean of the norm_arr array is close to 0 and the standard deviation close to 1.", "If you increase the sample size these numbers will get closer and closer to 0 and 1 respectively.", "Let\u2019s find the minimum and maximum number from the norm_arr array and at which index each of these are!", "The last step is to put everything in order. Let\u2019s sort the norm_arr array!", "Now we have an array that starts with the minimum value and goes up to the maximum.", "But what are the dimensions and the shape of an array?", "Imagine what you have a nested list looking like this:", "Here, you have one list, and inside that list, you have 4 more lists, each of them has 2 elements. Great. Now imagine having an even bigger list, containing 3 times the previous one! And we transform all of these lists into numpy arrays.", "We learned that to get the dimensions from an array we use .ndim, so let\u2019s try it out!", "To see that shape of an array use .shape", "What we see here is that the dimensions have to do with how nested the lists are!", "The shape of an array is the length of the lists used to create the array. In the big_array, we have 3 lists, each of them has 4 lists nested in them and each of these 4 lists is of length 2. So the shape is: (3, 4, 2).", "To create an array which has zero at each index we need to specify:", "The output is an array with floats of 0's.", "As with the .zeros function, the same things apply here. To create an array which has one at each index we need to specify:", "The output is an array with floats of 1's.", "O\u2019s and 1\u2019s are maybe not the only numbers that we probably want to use. What if we want to create an array which has at each index is the number 4? We can use the built-in function full.", "First, we specify the shape of the array and then the number that we want at each index.", "The first way is using a list, and the second-way using built-in functions. Now it\u2019s time to discover what we can do with these arrays! First, we will take a look at how to perform operations, then how to reshape the array, and finally how to access specific elements from an array.", "Let\u2019s say we have two arrays called a and b with the same shape and length.", "The same things apply to subtraction, multiplications, and division.", "Imagine that we have an array of length 9.", "The goal here is to create a new array, containing the same data but with a new shape! Let\u2019s choose (3,3) shape. We can use the reshape built-in function.", "So now we have split the first array in 3 parts, creating a (3,3) shaped array! Can you guess the dimension of the second array? How many things do you see nested inside the array? Let\u2019s check:", "It\u2019s like the medium_array we saw previously.", "We created arrays, of various dimensions and shapes. But how can we access the elements that we want?", "First, think of a 2-dim array, having 5 nested arrays, of 5 elements each. You can have this array as a matrix in your head.", "We have a nested array, so when we type mat[0] this represents the first dimension and the first array (because of the 0).", "Note that the indexing in python starts at 0!", "Instead of counting how long your array is you can use -1.", "Now let\u2019s say we want to get the value 0 from this matrix. With mat[0] we have from the first dimension the first array. Now with mat[0,0] we represent second dimension and the element 0 from the matrix.", "When we want to access all the elements we can use the symbol : . So here we say from the first dimension I want everything and from the second dimension I only want the 3rd element.", "Or else: from the first dimension the second array and from the second dimension, everything. Combining these two we are left with the second column.", "Here we want to get a slice or a piece of the matrix. Let\u2019s say we want a 3x3 matrix with the values from the upper left corner from the original matrix. We can do it like this:", "Masking is useful if we want to specify some limits. Let\u2019s say we only want from the matrix the values which are lower than 5.", "To get the actual values and not an array with boolean values we can do it like this:", "With that, you actually completed the numpy crash course! Be proud of yourself that you did it! I hope this was useful for you, you can play around with it using different inputs and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you in the pandas crash course.", "Thanks for reading, stay safe, and be happy.", "I am passionate about machine learning and AI.
