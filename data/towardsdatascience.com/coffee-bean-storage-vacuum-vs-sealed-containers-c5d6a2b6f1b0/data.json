Over time, I ended up using plastic bags, plastic containers, and sealed mason jars. I really preferred mason jars because they looked nice, and they felt sturdy. However, I wasn\u2019t sure if they were the best in storing coffee when most coffee is shipped in bags with vacuum seals.", "I designed a simple experiment where I would roast beans and split the roast between sealed mason jars and vacuum sealed mason jars. Then I would grind for two shots for each, and I did this over a few roasts over the life of the roasts. For each shot, I focused on taste and extraction yield (EY). There wasn\u2019t much of an effect on EY or even shot time, but taste definitely improved using a vacuum jar over a sealed jar.", "This is not a new conclusion from the aspect that most coffee is shipped in vacuum sealed bags. However, once people open the bags, the coffee beans are generally not kept in a vacuum. While I would advocate they should be as the taste is better.", "There have been a few vacuum jars specific to coffee, but before investigating those, I decided to get vacuum jars for pickling foods. They are wide-mouth jars with a vacuum lid, and you pump out the air. They aren\u2019t elegant or sleek, and they certainly don\u2019t stack vertically well.", "However, they worked, and I stacked them lying down so I could see if the seal was broken. The jars had to be resealed once a day for the first two or three days after roasting because of the CO2 released.", "I used two metrics for evaluating the differences between shots: Final Score and Coffee Extraction.", "Final score is the average of a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste). These scores were subjective, of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots. There is some variation in the scores. My aim was to be consistent for each metric, but some times the granularity was difficult and affected the final score.", "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is measured using a refractometer, and this number is used to determine the percentage of coffee extracted into the cup in combined with the output weight of the shot and the input weight of the coffee, called Extraction Yield (EY).", "I collected 40 paired samples that had the same parameters for coffee bean, tamp pressure, pre-infusion, paper filter, etc. This allowed me to run some other experiments at the same time while still being able to take a variety of paired samples.", "The first way to look at this data is using the paired data to do a scatter graph. The diagonal line represents when the sealed shot is the same as the vacuum shot.", "Storage jar terms used in the graphs:", "Overall, Vacuum sealed have better taste scores, but EY is about the same for both. We can breakdown these comparisons based on roast, and there is not a particular trend where one roast does particularly better or worse.", "Let\u2019s focus in on just the higher scores. Many of the lower scores were when the coffee roasts were very fresh, which means extraction was a bit lower and uneven.", "The pattern becomes very clear from this graph. To look a bit more at the data by roast and date, and we can see some of the points where the vacuum jar isn\u2019t performing as well are during the first few shots. Here are the shots sorted by Sealed scores with the roasts separated on the left and all together on the right.", "We can also look at Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) vs EY just to check. It looks like most shots were pulled with similar values which means the experiment had pretty decent control of variables.", "Comparing Final Score to EY and TDS, there is a clear trend. Taste heavily depends on a high EY and TDS because that\u2019s what I prefer. But even in these graphs, the vacuum data points are still a bit higher than the control or sealed jar results.", "Plotting all the data together, we can put a polynomial best fit function to the points, and it has a pretty high R^2 metric.", "I further summarized the results using the Mean and Max taste scores:", "At the highest level, there is a shift in scores that is statistically significant from the Sealed scores, but the difference in EY is not statistically significant.", "Aging seemed to be pretty important, so I wanted to cut out a section just on aging. From the scatter plots, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much other than taste (Final Score) being better.", "However, when we backup to the statistical level, we see some interesting bits. Based on age, the difference in taste varies. EY doesn\u2019t vary much.", "I also examined using a vacuum seal for storing grounds in the refrigerator. I have previously found that grounds stored in a refrigerator don\u2019t noticeably stale faster over a few days period, and I suspected a vacuum jar would help.", "The main challenge of vacuum sealing grounds is that if the grounds get sucked into the seal, the seal won\u2019t close properly. So I stored them instead a container with a cracked lid so air could go in and out of the smaller container, and then that was placed into the vacuum container.", "I found a slight improvement on taste and a degradation on EY. I had fewer samples, but the logistical challenges of continuing to store grounds this way made me want to move on to other experiments rather than building a larger database for another 2 or 3 weeks.", "I sorted the samples to plot them as lines below.", "Here are the general statistics with all the data and then with a few data points thrown out. With all the data, the change in Final Score is not statically significant, but the change in EY is. That flips by taking out four data points.", "Overall, vacuum jars for storage provides superior taste over regular sealed jars. There are quite a few options for coffee storage, and the difficulty has been how to determine if one method is better than another.", "James Hoffman did make a video about multiple containers, and he didn\u2019t find much of a difference between sealed containers and vacuum sealed containers. I suspect there are some differences between coffee cupping and espresso or another brew method, but I wanted to put data towards the method of storage that I use.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
