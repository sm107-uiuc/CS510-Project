This simple project shows how NLP can be used in practice and how text analysis can be of great importance in data science. For further details on this project and the full code, check this repository.", "Blurbs are a short description of a book, film, or other product written for promotional purposes. Book blurbs are usually short, in most cases a little above 100 words.", "A blurb of 200 words can be used to represent a book with about 58000 words.", "My main aims for this project included finding out the following:", "I web scraped okadabooks, Africa's most popular e-book store to get the data to be used in this analysis. One of the reasons I chose this site was the vast range of categories and its dedication to publishing African literature. Check here for more details on the web crawling algorithm.", "In order for proper text analysis to occur, the initial blurb gotten must be normalized. This includes removing punctuation, numbers, and changing all capital letters to lower cases. I created a replica of the blurb by using df['norm_blurb']= df.blurb then changed its type to strings with df.norm_blurb= df.norm_blurb.astype(str). I used lambda mapping functions to aid with the rest as shown below. Comments on each line of code show what each line was doing.", "The data frame looked like this after normalization:", "To increase the accuracy of my results, I choose the genres with at least a total of 100,000 words contained in the norm_blurb column. There were about 1.1Million words contained in all the blurbs. This also helped reduce the complexity of this project.", "I went with the four genres that are underlined in the picture above: self_help, fiction, romance, and religion categories. Data frames were created for the four genres and another data frame with length 2000 tagged random_df was created with randomized rows from the four genres by using the df.sample(l=2000). function.", "Stop words are the most common words in a language. Most sentences need to contain stop words in order to be full sentences that make sense. They are words that have no/little influence on semantic relationships. Generally, stop words are removed because they aren\u2019t significant and distort the word frequency analysis. Import the library by using from sklearn.feature_extraction import stop_words. stopwords.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS will be used in the function to remove the stop words. Examples of English stopwords include:", "A function was used to return the required result. This function creates a dictionary which counts the number of times a word appears then deletes the stop words. Each line has a comment explaining what it does.", "The first question helps answer the second. Yes! The 10 most common words in the chosen categories gave insights into these questions.", "When a person looks for a romantic novel, he/she is looking for some kind of LOVE story. For religious books, it is inevitable not to see words like GOD, CHURCH. Most motivational books(self-help) usually talk about tips on how to be SUCCESSFUL within a span of TIME. Fiction in the easiest terms is some kind of STORY.", "Notice the bolded words above are in the 10 most common words in their respective genres.", "More deductions could be made from the most frequent words:", "From looking at the frequent words, a lot could be deduced down to the kind of books that are available on okadabooks.com. Although most blurbs are indeed used for promotional purposes, they are great representations of whole books.", "Since we have ascertained that blurbs are a great representation of books, similarity metrics can be calculated by comparing word frequencies. In this article, I will only concentrate on the similarity between religious books and the remaining chosen genres. Which of the categories is most similar to religious books? Which is least similar?", "Jaccard similarity compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. In easy terms, it is gotten by finding the intersection of sets divided by its union. The function below was used to attain the required results.", "The value ranges from zero to one, where 1 means two data sets are 100% similar. The similarities were then visualized with a donut plot.", "Apart from self-similarity, religious books were most similar to self_help books with about 34%. This goes back to our initial deduction:", "God is the 10th most common word in SELF HELP(MOTIVATIONAL) BOOKS. This suggests that success is sometimes linked with the spiritual aspects of life.", "For further insights, I looked into the most common words between the two categories. The results were interesting.", "The samples for the two categories give a feel on some of the written blurbs. This will only be limited to self_help and religion categories.", "Strength of Character is a 31-Day devotional and workbook for Sister Minister. This book will teach you on how to build your prayer life, be a better person and improve your relationship with God.", "It is a motivational personal development and business strategies book. It was written to create a balance for the disparity between the rich and the poor. What every youth needs to become a useful youth, to maximize their potential and to discover their purpose.", "This short project looked into the likeness between two objects and confirmed that the similarity metric between two things gives insights into their properties and overall characteristics. In this case, several genres were compared by using natural language processing which gave an understanding of the writing contents of different categories of books.", "I would love to hear your thoughts on this.
