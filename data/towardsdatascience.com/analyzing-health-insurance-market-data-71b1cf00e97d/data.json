The datasets include individual and family health plans available in states where the federal government is operating the marketplace. Quantitative analysis of available data on health insurance plans, as well as other healthcare services in general, may aid in making our healthcare system more transparent when it comes to pricing and value-based care.", "In this post, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the QHP landscape data. The data is available here. It is also available as a \u2018.csv\u2019 file on my GitHub.", "First, let\u2019s store the data in a pandas data frame and print the list of columns:", "We can also print the full list of columns:", "As you can see there are 128 columns. We will limit our analysis to the following columns:", "We can see that there are several categorical columns. Let\u2019s define a function that takes as input a data frame, column name, and limit. When called it prints a dictionary of categorical values and how frequently they appear:", "Let\u2019s apply our function to the \u2018Issuer Name\u2019 column and limit our results to the five most common values:", "We can see that the Issuer Name \u2018Medica\u2019 has the most records.", "Let\u2019s apply our function to the \u2018County Name\u2019 column:", "As you can see, this is useful as a quick test to see if there is any significant imbalance in the data which is often a crucial thing to deal with when it comes to model building.", "Next, it would be useful to generate summary statistics from the numerical columns like \u2018Medical Maximum Out Of Pocket \u2014 Individual \u2014 Standard\u2019. First, we need to convert the string-valued dollar amounts into float types.", "And let\u2019s make sure that the conversion worked:", "Now, let\u2019s define a function that takes a data frame, a categorical column, and a numerical column. The mean and standard deviation of the numerical column for each category is stored in a data frame and the data frame is sorted in descending order according to the mean. This is useful if you want to quickly see if certain categories have higher or lower mean and/or standard deviation values for a particular numerical column.", "We can look at summary statistics of for \u2018Issuer Name\u2019 and \u2018Medical Maximum Out Of Pocket \u2014 Individual\u2019:", "\u2018Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas\u2019 has the highest Maximum Out of Pocket for Individuals and zero standard deviation accross plan types.", "Next, we will use boxplots to visualize the distribution in numeric values based on the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile, and third quartile. If you are unfamiliar with them, take a look at the article Understanding Boxplots.", "Similar to the summary statistics function, this function takes a data frame, categorical column, and numerical column and displays boxplots for the most common categories based on the limit:", "Let\u2019s generate boxplots for OOP_INDV in the 5 most commonly occurring Issuer Names:", "We can perform similar analyses on the \u2018Medical Deductible \u2014 Individual \u2014 Standard\u2019. Let\u2019s convert the string-valued dollar amounts into float types:", "And let\u2019s make sure that the conversion worked:", "We can look at summary statistics of for \u2018Issuer Name\u2019 and \u2018Medical Deductible \u2014 Individual \u2014 Standard\u2019:", "\u2018Wellmark Value Health Plan, Inc.\u2019 and \u2018Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa, Inc.\u2019 have the highest mean \u2018Medical Deductible \u2014 Individual \u2014 Standard\u2019.", "Let\u2019s generate box plots for DEDUCT_INDV in the 5 most commonly occurring Issuer Names:", "Finally, let\u2019s define a function takes a data frame, categorical column, categorical value, and two numerical columns as input and displays a scatterplot:", "Let\u2019s generate a scatterplot of OOP_INDV vs DEDUCT_INDV for Medica:", "I will stop here but please feel free to play around with the data and code yourself. I encourage you to perform similar analyses on the emergency room, specialist, and primary care columns. For example, it would be interesting to see how the percent coinsurance for primary care varies across issuer names.", "To recap, I went over several methods for analyzing the health insurance market data. This included visualizing the data with boxplots and scatterplots. We also defined functions for generating summary statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and counts for categorical values. I hope this post was interesting. The code from this post is available on GitHub. Thank you for reading!", "Your home for data science.
