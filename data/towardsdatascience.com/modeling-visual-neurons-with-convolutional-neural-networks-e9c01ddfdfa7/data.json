This weird organ has been evolving for millions of years, ever-changing and adjusting to handle novel stimuli and conditions they would encounter, looking like a bag of slimy, gooey matter folded in various ways inside our head. Yet, this organ and the billions of neurons that it is composed of are our best bet for understanding what intelligence is and how it emerges. Another good bet is to create (artificial) intelligence ourselves and then explain our own creation.", "In recent years, we\u2019ve come one step closer to creating intelligent machines. At least in terms of vision, we now have systems that can accurately classify images from thousands of categories. This is thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the efficiency of the graphical processing units used to train them. Given a sufficient amount of images for each category to train these networks, CNNs can learn to adjust their artificial neurons\u2019 connection strength (\u201cweights\u201d) in such a way that, after training, they are able to classify images that they have never even seen before.", "Interestingly, CNNs have been loosely inspired by our brain\u2019s visual system in order to do that. Visual information that enters our brain through our eyes, travels through neurons in brain regions and is consumed in stages of increasing complexity, starting from simple visual representations such as edges, lines, curves etc. and continues with more complex representations such as, for instance, faces or full bodies. This results in a person understanding increasingly more complex information about the observed object. In fact, this deconstruction of information in stages of increasing complexity is what CNNs also seem to replicate. The concept is not foreign to older computational approaches to vision. It is also seen in the older, biologically inspired, HMAX model that tries to explain visual processing in cortex as a \u201chierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations\u201d (more on that here, here and here).", "How can we create a model for neurons of visual areas of the brain using artificial neurons in CNN layers? A \u201cmodel\u201d is a mathematical function that, given the same input as a biological neuron, can produce a similar output. In order to create it, one first needs to understand and define the input.", "Here we take a look at a study performed by my colleagues and me from the Neurophysiology Group of KU Leuven (publication). This study looked specifically at the inferotemporal cortex, known to be one of the \u201clate\u201d processing stages of our visual system (ventral stream) and, more specifically, from a section of cells that are more responsive to images that contain a body versus images of other categories (e.g. faces). They get excited when a body is present in the image, even if it\u2019s headless!  Example input is images of silhouettes on a blank background (see below)", "Biological neurons respond to images like this (Fig2), and scientists can collect neuronal responses through electrophysiology experiments. In such experiments, a monkey is shown images on a monitor, and an electrode inserted in the brain records the activity or response of neurons to the presented images.  An example neuron was presented (through its host\u2019s eyes, i.e., a macaque monkey named Escher) with hundreds of images of black shapes with white background. Some of the shapes were random, some shapes resembled animal or human bodies, and other shapes resembled silhouettes of other categories. The study\u2019s goal? To find out 1) if we can use artificial neurons from CNN layers to predict the actual biological response of that neuron to silhouette images and 2) to discover which layers of a CNN (early, middle or late) model these responses best.", "The role of CNNs is to receive an input image and return a number of probabilities for each of the classes that it is trained to recognize.", "A common CNN architecture usually includes hundreds of feature maps in the early layers and that number goes down progressively in the next deeper layers. These feature maps (as seen in the example CNN architecture image) are slices of the whole layer and consist of thousands of neurons each.", "The word \u201cfeature\u201d comes up often when talking about CNNs, and it might be confusing to understand exactly what it means. By \u201cfeatures,\u201d we refer to the output of our neurons; the term \u201cactivations\u201d is also used interchangeably with features because t is easier to grasp from a neuroscientific point of view, since it refers to how much a neuron \u201cactivates\u201d given an input stimulus. For those interested, there are wonderful resources online that do a fine job explaining how CNNs work in greater detail (e.g. Karpathy\u2019s course, C. Olah\u2019s blog, Adit Deshpande\u2019s blog, this hackernoon article etc.). Let\u2019s see what our neurons do.", "Each neuron in a feature map can only \u201cpeek\u201d at a small region of the input. Thus, a neuron in the upper left corner of a feature map can see a small window of the upper left corner of the input image. The neighboring neuron in the same feature map right next to it can see a small window adjacent to the first one\u2019s window. This means that a feature map can see the whole input image by \u201cscanning\u201d it with its neurons. So why do we need so many feature maps? And what do all these neurons actually do?  Each neuron is assigned a mathematical operation to perform based on which layer it belongs to. This operation involves the weights (connection strengths) of the neuron and the small window it can see.   You might be wondering how it is possible to perform any kind of mathematical operation between weights and images. It is possible, because in the digital world everything is numbers. The weights are numbers that indicate how strongly a neuron is connected to the pixels that constitute an image (or a small window of that image). The pixels are also numbers, and in a black and white image, the black pixels are represented with the number 0, and the white pixels with the number 1. In a gray image, a pixel can take a value inside a range (that we usually define to be 0\u2013255; see why) which indicates its brightness. One end of the range is black (darkest) and the other end is white (brightest). Color images are a bit more complex since each of their pixels has three values that indicate its brightness in a color channel. We use the Red, Green and Blue channels for displaying purposes and we thus refer to color images as RGB images.", "As we said earlier, each neuron is assigned a mathematical operation as its task based on the layer it belongs to. For example, a neuron in the first convolutional layer performs a convolution operation between its weights and a small window in the input image. This convolution operation is a element-wise multiplication between weights and pixel values and then the total sum of the result. The idea is that the neuron will output a large number if it detects a pattern that looks like its weights\u2019 pattern. By training the network, these weights actually change such that they look like patterns of the input. Therefore, you can think of a neuron as a pattern detector, checking if the area that it\u2019s looking at contains something familiar to the pattern of its weights and outputting a \u201cscore\u201d for this familiarity. Interestingly, neurons of the same feature map are set to have the same weights, so each feature map basically scans the whole input image looking for a specific pattern. Therefore, the more feature maps we have, the more patterns we detect.", "A neuron in any subsampling, or pooling, layer takes a single value of a small window in the previous layer. Thus, a neuron of a max-pooling layer simply takes the maximum value of that small window. The idea here is that even if you shift the input image to the side, or even rotate, or scale it, the neurons in the pooling layer will still detect similar patterns. That makes CNNs tolerant to these image transformations.", "The convolutional and subsampling layers progressively become smaller in size by gathering information about the image and outputting a more compressed summary of the important points they have discovered. Note that the layers receive input information from layers before them in the classical CNN architecture. There are more architectures that information \u201cjumps\u201d past layers creating recurrent connections, but these are not covered here.   The image content information will end up in fully connected layers, which help us with the final classification. A neuron in a fully-connected layer, is connected to all neurons of the previous layer. The fully connected layer\u2019s role is to create a flattened representation of all the information that previous layers have gathered about the input image. It is flattened, because neurons in these layers are not structured in any way like feature maps and one can think them as a 1-dimensional array of numbers. This flattened representation consists of even fewer neurons than the previous layers, which contributes to the final goal of reaching the number of classes that we are training the CNN to recognize. Eventually, we will have a list of scores for each of the classes as output and the highest score will indicate the most probable class.", "The networks used in the study were \u201cpre-trained\u201d. This means that they have already been trained on classifying images using a very large dataset and then their network weights were saved and made publicly available to download. Thus, to get each layer\u2019s activations, one provides an input image to this pre-trained network and then takes the output of each layer. One can imagine the image \u201cflowing\u201d in the network, just like information flows in our brain, and then we can capture it at every processing stage (layer). This captured information is what we use to create our model.  The mathematical modeling task here is measuring the relation between the biological neuron\u2019s response and the corresponding values of artificial neurons\u2019 activations. This task is what statisticians call a \u201cregression analysis\u201d, where one tries to predict a value of one variable (biological neuron\u2019s response) given the values of other variables (artificial neurons\u2019 activations).  In every regression analysis, there are two numerical matrices involved: the X matrix of predictor variables and the Y matrix of the target variable(s). In the present scenario, one can consider the whole CNN\u2019s neurons and build a huge X matrix as the predictors, but that would be very computationally intensive even for modern day\u2019s computers and it wouldn\u2019t give us any idea about the differences within layers. Therefore, we built a separate regression setup for each CNN layer and an example of how this looks is shown in the image below.", "By building these regression analysis setups, we are essentially trying to replace a monkey\u2019s biological neuron with all artificial neurons present in a CNN layer (X).   Ultimately, this study found that deeper CNN layers proved to be strong models for body patch neurons, which are also deeper in our brain\u2019s visual processing stages. While the pre-trained networks are trained using natural images, this didn\u2019t hinder the results of this study that used silhouette images. Thus, deep CNN layers could receive an image as input and produce a response very close to what an actual neuron would produce. More importantly, the best model from one of those deep layers, could explain on average up to 80% of the variability in the responses of real neurons to silhouettes.", "To build an artificial way to represent the same function as neuron C65b, we needed to use an efficient mathematical way to get Y given X. We\u2019ll cover that in the more technical part (coming soon). There, we\u2019ll go over our modeling options and why it\u2019s not such an easy problem that can be tackled with simple linear multiple regression.", "(more technical part on mathematical modeling to follow)", "DISCLAIMER: I am an author of eNeuro\u2019s publication here.
