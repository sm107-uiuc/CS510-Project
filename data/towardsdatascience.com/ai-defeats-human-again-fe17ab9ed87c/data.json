AI dominance in board games was repeated in 2015 and 2016 where AlphaGO, a DeepMind\u2019s AI system, defeated professional GO player Fan Hui and world champion GO player Lee Sedol.", "AI dominance over human is not constricted to board games, in 2011 IBM Watson, a computer system capable of answering trivial questions beat Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings in a Jeopardy game.", "We can add one more date to this growing list of AI victories over humans.", "The DARPA AlphaDogFight is a series of trials that tests the capabilities of AI algorithms executing dogfight manoeuvres, combat and strategies.", "The final trial was held on 18\u201320th August 2020 between eight teams and the winning team, Heron Systems, AI faced off with a human fighter jet pilot.", "The purpose of DARPA\u2019s AlphaDogFight is to find methodologies of developing AI systems that can shift the responsibilities of aerial combat and manoeuvring from the human pilot to the AI system. Inevitably building trust in AI within flight systems.", "The human pilot went by the name \u2018Banger\u2019 and Herons System\u2019s AI was identified by the name \u2018Heron\u2019. The faceoff between Heron and Banger took places in a simulated environment, where both pilots had control of an F-16 fighter jet.", "This final challenge aimed to test the Heron\u2019s manoeuvring capabilities, combat system and decision making against a human adversary. The challenge lasted five-rounds, and Heron, the AI pilot, defeated Banger in an incontestable manner.", "The commentators of the event predicted that the faceoff between Banger and Heron was going to be \u201ca very close fight\u201d.", "After all the rounds, it was a flawless victory to Heron for all five rounds of the challenge.", "According to the commentators, Heron displayed superhuman capabilities of being able to shoot and aim very accurately while performing highly dynamic manoeuvers.", "In some rounds, Banger changed tactics and strategy to get the upper hand against Heron. During the last round, the change in tactic by Banger led to a round that highlighted some limitation in Heron\u2019s capabilities. The round still ended with Heron coming out victorious.", "In all five rounds, Heron didn\u2019t lose any health, meaning that no single shot from Banger hit Heron\u2019s fighter jet.", "Despite the overwhelming victory by Heron, it was noted that the AI system had \u2018perfect state information\u2019, this means that the AI systems had uninterrupted quantitative and visual data of the simulated environment.", "In a real-world scenario having complete information on the environment and other variables is not common.", "The unpredictable nature of reality has an impact on how serious military forces take information and seemingly \u2018good\u2019 performance from simulated environments.", "Simply kept we are not going to be seeing any AI systems flying an F-16 fighter jet outside of a simulation anytime soon.", "The advancements and lessons learnt from the DARPA AlphaDogFight trials will set a precedent for future developments that can lead to more reliable AI systems that can work hand in hand with combat pilots outside of simulated environments.", "The final trial held on the 18th \u2014 20th August 2020 involved eight teams. Across three days, the teams\u2019 AI systems each faced other AI algorithms and then after faced each other in a round-robin event.", "The final day had the top four teams face off in an elimination match, in which the top winning team faced the human adversary.", "The teams involved in the final AlphaDogTrial event:", "Heron Systems AI agent is a deep reinforcement learning-based AI that has gained expertise of over 30 years of flight time experience through constant training within a simulated environment.", "The Heron team attributed their success to two main factors: scale and diversity.", "The scale component of their attributed success refers to the amount of flight time in years the winning AI agent has been able to accumulate. The diversity component speaks to the number of AI agents that Heron Systems developed to face off against each other; each agent with their own unique neural network architecture, reward systems and build.", "According to a spokesperson from Heron System, the next steps for the team is to take the AI systems and incorporate them within drones that can be manned in real-life environments.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
