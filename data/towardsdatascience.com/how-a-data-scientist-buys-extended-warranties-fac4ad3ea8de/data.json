If you have not read it, check it out here.", "We have all been there. We have just committed to buying that new shiny car and we are about to make it out of the building fairly unscathed. But wait, before we can sign on the dotted line and ride off into the sunset we have one more meeting with the \u201cfinance\u201d guy (a.k.a. last line of a long line of sales pitches). They will offer you a whole slew of extended warranty options to protect your new pseudo-asset. These are some of the biggest moneymakers for car dealerships and surprisingly there is a lot of math to back it up and that is what we intend to explore.", "Let\u2019s say you are sitting in the finance office of your local car dealership about to close on a deal.", "You are offered an extended warranty on you tires that will only cost you $7/month.", "It covers everything from you running over a nail in your driveway and needing a patch to a complete blowout that requires a brand new tire.", "Should you take the deal? Is it worth it? Whats in it for the dealership?", "This is a game of probabilities and for the sake of simplicity, we will use some fairly reasonable expected probabilities that I made up after seconds and seconds of thinking about it. Let\u2019s say that in a year there is a 5% chance of having a total blowout and a 30% chance of just needing a patch.And let\u2019s say that the average cost of replacing a tire is $200 and the average cost of a patch is $20.", "What is in it for the dealership?", "To answer the question of why the dealership would offer this deal and how much money they expect to make from this we can start formulating this into mathematical equations.", "Let\u2019s say the dealership sells 1000 extended warranties in a year.", "In order to figure out how much cost the dealership will incur we can use the following basic probability concept where E(x) will be the expected number of vehicles the dealership will need to repair.", "With some basic arithmetic we can now get the following table:", "So in one year, the dealership is expecting to make a profit of $68,000 from 1000 of these deals (no wonder the salesman are so pushy).", "But so far this isn\u2019t very interesting and looks more like accounting than data science.", "is a distribution (the Binomial distribution to be exact). And distributions come in all shapes and sizes. Some have names and functions that define them and some don\u2019t.", "How do you interpret this distribution?The value on the y-axis represents the probability of observing the corresponding value on the x-axis. I realize that is confusing. The easiest way to understand is through an example. Let\u2019s say you flip a fair coin 100 times (fair coin means: the probability of a head or a tails is 0.5). How many heads do you think you will get? Of course, the expected number of heads is 50. But you and I both know that it is entirely possible that you could get 54 or 43 or 61. But what about 95 heads? Is that possible? Sure it is possible, but is it likely?", "If you flipped a coin 100 times and got 95 heads, common sense would take over and you would be thinking that this coin must be weighted. And you would be right to have that concern because the probability of getting 95 heads in 100 coin flips is 5.939138117904783e-17 which if you can\u2019t convert this scientific number to human numbers don\u2019t worry, it is really small.(translation: it probably won\u2019t happen).", "This probability is represented in the Binomial distribution graph.I have now added an orange X that represents the probability of getting 95 heads.See how low the blue line is on the y-axis when x = 95? It is just about 0. This tells us that there is basically a 0 percent chance of getting 95 heads out of 100 flips (technically it could happen but it is extremely rare).", "What if we replace the coin flipping example with a more real-life example (Maybe extended warranties you say?).", "To tackle this problem, we will use a different distribution, a derivation of the Binomial distribution \u2014 The Poisson Distribution", "Why use the Poisson Distribution instead of the Binomial?Without going into too much detail, we could use them both to answer the same types of questions but in this particular case, the Poisson Distribution gives us some natural benefits over the Binomial. Mainly that it isn\u2019t binary and therefore we are not restricted to a single 0 or 1 per time period. To demonstrate this point: If I wanted to define my time period as a year it is entirely possible that a driver could have more than one blowout or patch. The Poisson Distribution allows me to model that whereas if I were using the Binomial distribution then I would need to shrink my time periods down so that there could only be one possible blowout or patch. This may not be possible or at the very least not very easy as you may violate some assumptions in the model. These reasons make the Poisson Distribution a more natural and common approach to \u201crare event\u201d modeling \u2014 like patches and blowouts. If you would like to read more about how similar the Poisson and Binomial distributions are here is a great article.", "what is the probability that the car dealership fails to make a profit?", "Before doing any distribution modeling, we need to understand the relationship between patches and blowouts as a function of profit.Earlier, we calculated the expected profit for the car dealership which came out to $68,000. Now we are asking what are the odds that all of that profit gets eaten up in cost?To start, let\u2019s look at how many patches and blowout repairs a car dealership would have to do to break even. This can be defined by the following equation.", "We can then re-arrange the equation and plot the line below.", "The shaded pink area shows the space in which the dealership would lose money. Something interesting to add to this already awesome plot is the current expected values.", "The two solid black lines show the expected values for the number of blowouts (vertical line) and the number of patches (horizontal line) and the intersection of the two shows the joint expectation.So we can already start to see that on average the dealership won\u2019t be in the pink area, therefore, they won\u2019t lose any money.", "But just like in the coin example, we know that the expected value isn\u2019t necessarily what happens in real life.", "So, is it possible that the dealership loses money? (Is it possible that we end up in the pink shaded area?)Let\u2019s find out.This is where our old friend the Poisson Distribution comes in.", "The above function is the Probability Mass Function of the Poisson distribution (blah blah math blah \u2014 this just means that if we plug numbers in we get probabilities out) Let's take the following as an example:", "The probability that there will be exactly 210 blowouts in a year is 0.0215.", "This number may seem low because 210 is pretty close to the expected value of 200 but remember this is the probability of getting exactly 210 blowouts. If we wanted to answer the question of getting at least 210 blowouts then we can simply just compute the probabilities of each of the values to the right of our orange bar and then sum them up. (pro tip: given that there isn\u2019t a true upper bound on this distribution, normally it is more convenient to sum all of the probabilities to the left of the orange bar and subtract them from 1). Which mathematically would look like this:", "If I was to work this out then the probability of getting at least 210 blowouts would be 0.249 and graphically this probability is represented by the orange shaded area below:", "What does this mean in plain english?There is about a 25% chance that the dealership will have to repair at least 210 blowouts in a year.", "Since blowouts are only one way the dealership has to pay out we need to do the same thing for patches. When we get both probabilities we can then create a joint probability which in this case just means we multiply them together. This can be written mathematically as:", "Let say we are interested in at least 210 blowouts and at least 1500 patches in a single year. The resulting joint probability is 0.000498.", "Again, what does this mean in plain English?Basically that there is less than 0.01% chance that the dealership will have to repair at least 210 blowouts and at least 1500 patches in a year.", "But in order to really start telling a story we need to do this for all combinations of patches and blowouts. We can sum these joint probabilities on either side of the profit boundary that we created earlier to figure out the total probability of the dealership losing money.", "In practice, the way I will accomplish this is using the Poisson formula from above and computing the exact joint probabilities for all combinations in the white region (everything below the blue line) and then subtracting that sum from 1.", "To visualize this, I created a heatmap showing the joint probabilities at each combination.", "The picture is starting to become pretty clear. It seems highly unlikely that the dealership will lose any money as all of the density is on the \u201cmaking money\u201d side of the blue line. But just to be sure we will sum up all of the values on the left side of the profit boundary and subtract the sum from 1.", "Question 2: Should I, as the customer, purchase the extended warranty?", "This is really the question we all care about. I just bought a car, should I buy the warranty?", "We just demonstrated that it is a really good deal for the dealership but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is bad for you (some things in life are mutually beneficial).", "All of the math is very redundant because we are really asking the same question as before but reversed and with a much smaller space. So we will skip the details.", "What does it take for you, purchasing just one warranty, to get your money\u2019s worth? All we need to do is figure out how many blowouts and patches it would take for your cost (had you not bought the warranty) to out-weigh the cost of the warranty", "To interpret this chart, as an example you can say, if I have at least 3 blowouts and at least 0 patches then I should have bought the warranty. But what are the odds that happens?", "I can now apply my old friend the Poisson distribution formula to get the probabilities associated with each and then sum them together.", "The final probability of you losing money is 0.00144", "Final Translation: you can probably skip the warranty", "The beauty of this is you can adjust the probabilities to suit your needs and do the math yourself.", "To be honest, real life is more complicated than what I have presented here. There are countless other variables that could be taken into account.", "Maybe you drive more than the average person.Maybe you drive near constructions sites or dirt roads a lot.Maybe you are a worse driver than most and will run over things in the road.", "My point is, there could be scenarios where it is worth it to purchase the warranty because your probability of the event is higher than average (Or you don\u2019t like money \u2014 also a valid reason).But I think we demonstrated that in general, you would be better off leaving the warranty off of your final bill.", "Life tip number 1I know what you are thinking. What's the probability of my house being destroyed by a hurricane? I don\u2019t remember the last hurricane in Kansas. This proves that my state farm agent has been ripping me off.Pump the brakes a sec (pun intended), a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself", "Self, does the most extreme catastrophic event impact my life significantly?", "If the answer is yes (like your house burning down) then it is probably worth your money to be covered.But if the answer is no (you have a flat) then maybe it isn\u2019t worth it.", "Life tip number 2When you are confronted with the decision and you aren\u2019t sure if you are being ripped off or not and the event won\u2019t alter your life you can use this quick \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d calculation to figure out if you should buy or not.", "Which basically translates to if the expected value is less than the cost, then you can pass.", "Thanks for reading! I hope you have success in your adventures of extended warranties and remember next time you buy a car and are confronted with buying the warranties just ask for the lambda parameter to plug into your Poisson distribution calculator.If you would like to follow along on your own you can find the Jupyter Notebook here.", "Bonus Question: What happens when you change the probabilities?", "This question could really send us down a rabbit hole as there are enormous amounts of variations and possibilities that could happen. But I think it is fairly obvious that if the probabilities of patches and/or blowouts increase this will move the dark region on our joint probability heat-map closer and closer to the profitability boundary. But the dealerships, of course, wouldn\u2019t take a loss \u2014 they would just increase the price of the warranty.Would you be swayed to not purchase it if it cost $8/month as opposed to $7/month? Probably not.", "Just to demonstrate this point, I will leave you with one fun plot that shows the relationship of probabilities and Poisson expectations on blowouts. As the probability of a blowout increases the number of expected blowouts in a year moves closer and closer to the maximum number of blowouts the dealership can handle before losing money and at a certain point, it actually crosses that boundary almost guaranteeing that the dealership would lose money which of course would force them to raise prices.", "Your home for data science.
