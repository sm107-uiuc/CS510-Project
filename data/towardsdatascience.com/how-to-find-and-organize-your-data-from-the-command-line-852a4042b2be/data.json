But in your career, you\u2019ll likely spend (and have spent) a non-trivial amount of time looking for and getting context around said data. In my experience, this commonly plays out as a wild goose chase \u2014 you ask the most senior person on your team who refers you to someone else, who refers you to someone else, who tells you they don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You then repeat this process until you find someone who can refer you to a useful table.", "But this algorithm is really pretty terrible! It\u2019s by no means an exhaustive search, and you\u2019ll often end up with an unmaintained, unused table. If you decide to just risk it and use this in your production pipelines, you could end up costing your company a lot of money when you find out six months down the line that this table doesn\u2019t do what you think it does. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a huge waste of time! Sometimes you\u2019ll forget what the table does months later and you\u2019ll have to do this again, to the dismay of your coworkers. So what can you do?", "Luckily, there\u2019s already a solution to this problem: the data catalog. Data catalogs are aptly named, for they simply provide you with a catalog of your data. They let you search and find tables by name, view their columns and metadata, and enrich this metadata with additional documentation. A number of closed source players exist, like Alation and Collibra, and open-source versions have been released by a number of tech companies, including Netflix\u2019s Metacat, Lyft\u2019s Amundsen, and LinkedIn\u2019s Datahub. And tons of companies have been creating these tools for themselves (Airbnb, Uber, Google, Facebook \u2014 to name a few).", "This begs the question: why not just use/implement one of these solutions?", "Well, you might want to seriously consider it, eventually, but there are enormous barriers to entry: catalogs tend to be expensive to set up, or, in the case of open-source tools, difficult to set up. For companies with only a handful of data scientists and analysts, it\u2019s hardly worth upwards of 10s of thousands of dollars or months of work to implement a tool that will, at best, save you the few minutes of turning to your neighbor and asking him/her about that table again.", "I\u2019ve talked to a number of friends at smaller startups about this, and while the problem of data documentation and data discovery is salient even at the smallest scales, the cost-benefit tradeoff simply doesn\u2019t make sense. But just because the problem is too expensive to solve with existing methods doesn\u2019t mean that a cost-effective solution doesn\u2019t exist.", "I thought, \u201cthere has to be an easier way to set up a catalog.\u201d Day-to-day, I just want to look for my data, check the column names, and take some notes. Why is that so hard? I already can do that manually by saving everything in a team-wide spreadsheet.", "Metaframe is a CLI-based data catalog with a custom Markdown-based metadata backend, a fzf-based search service, and an ETL pipeline written in bash and python, built off of lyft\u2019s amundsendatabuilder library.", "But that\u2019s hard to grok. Here\u2019s a quick demonstration:", "At its core, metaframe is just a slightly opinionated documentation tool. Want to just write notes for one table? Easy, just type the following:", "and you\u2019ll enter into a text file located at ~/.metaframe/metadata/table_name.docs.md, where you can add your notes on this table. These will then be accessible in your search, by running", "And this isn\u2019t tied to tables \u2014 you can create a new doc for SQL queries, ML models, jupyter notebooks, or more. I personally keep a subfolder in ~/.metaframe/ called recipes, where I store named snippets of SQL.", "If you want a more full-fledged data catalog experience, metaframe also supports locally-run ETL jobs. All you need to do is specify a connection in yaml by running mf connections edit, then run mf etl, and all your data will be accessible using mf. After searching and finding a table you want to take notes for, you can press enter to edit a doc associated with the selected table, and this doc will be appended to your metadata preview window in future searches.", "Because the file structure is entirely text-based, you can even navigate to ~/.metaframe/metadata and version-track it with git. In a company with a number of collaborators wanting to share notes, a simple pattern could be to set up CI/CD (or an airflow job) to populate this data in a git repository automatically and have users push their personal docs to branches in this repo. Because this is version tracked, you should be able to easily see what tables your coworkers know about without even having to ask them by checking the commit history of their personal branch.", "The only issue I\u2019ve noticed with metaframe is that it\u2019ll start to chug at around 100,000 tables. But for companies that have this sort of scale, it may be prudent to (a) not run the ETL job locally and (b) restrict which schemas are being pulled. In metaframe, this is simply a matter of adding a few flags, like included_schemas or excluded_schemas, to your mf connections edit file. See the docs for more details.", "Metaframe supports manual documentation and ETL over presto or neo4j (amundsen) out-of-the-box, but we also support custom build scripts to enable custom extraction jobs (from any warehouse, from pre-scraped database stores, etc.). We are also in the process of building out more native connections (e.g. Snowflake and Postgres are in the works). If you\u2019re passionate about getting this to work for your particular setup, feel free to drop an issue and we\u2019ll help out. Or, if you\u2019re so inclined, make a contribution! :)", "Data documentation and data discovery are serious problems, but they\u2019re not things that data scientists typically think about. It\u2019s easy to neglect a problem that wastes less than an hour a week, but I\u2019m here to tell you that there are solutions for this at all scales. Give metaframe a try, and I guarantee you once you have a taste of it, you won\u2019t be able to live without it.", "Your home for data science.
