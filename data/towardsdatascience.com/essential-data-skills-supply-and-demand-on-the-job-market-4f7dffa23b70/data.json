With over 20,000 respondents, The Kaggle ML & DS 2018 is one of, if not the most important and extensive surveys ever conducted about the state of the Data Science community. The data set contains answers to over 50 questions, many of them multi-choice or even free text, so there\u2019s a huge playground for data lovers to explore. This post is a transcript of the kernel I did as part of the Kaggle Survey 2018 Challenge.", "The theme of this study is employability, so most of my exploration will focus on a \u2014 rather large \u2014 subset of the community: those employed and currently active in one of the major roles of the Data Science field.", "Being in possession of skills which are in high demand on the job market.", "In the first part I will use a selection of the survey data to answer questions like:", "I think the answers to these questions are especially relevant to students, to the unemployed and to anyone planning a career transition or simply ways to improve themselves. Hopefully the reader of this kernel doesn\u2019t share the following opinion:", "\u201cI\u2019m a student, don\u2019t ask these questions please\u201d", "Responder #27 in Free Form Responses", "In the second part I will focus on technology stacks specific to each role, comparing the supply and demand for them on the job market and identifying the most useful skills to possess.", "If you are a student or just recently started your career and are still unsure about the technology skills to target or if you are an experienced data scientist looking for ways to improve your chances on the job market, the first step is to identify all possibilities and explore the differences between them.", "I cleaned up the data by imputing missing values, transforming to dummy variables and normalizing numerical values. I then used LDA to perform supervised dimensionality reduction and map the resulting feature vectors to a 2 dimensional space while maximing the separation of the clusters. The feature set I used for LDA is based on questions which I felt are the best predictors of a person\u2019s daily activity at work.", "The interpretation of the resulting principal components and naming of the axes is highly subjective because it is the weighted combination of multiple features and can be too complex to describe in simple words. Based on the resulting positions of the various groups I like to think of PC1(horizontal) as a Business (left) vs. Code (right) axis and of PC2 (vertical) as an Engineering (bottom) vs. Research (top) axis.", "As you probably noticed on the first image, the clusters are clearly overlapping, the definitions of these roles are extremely fuzzy. For example the Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles share most of the same characteristics with slight differences in the application of the conclusions resulting from the analysis. Despite the overlaps, the positions of the cluster centroids reveal some interesting patterns. The size of the bubbles represent the size of the group.", "Let\u2019s explore these roles by work methodology. For the first 5 categories I calculated the percent of people considering that particular acitivity important.", "Q11 \u2014 Which activities make up an important of your role at work?", "For the importance of code writing the answers were given as percents, so I used them directly.", "Q23: Approximately what percent of your time at work or school is spent actively coding?", "The colored bars represent the deviation from the mean measured in percent points. The little dots next to the boxes indicate that the value is the maximum (blue) or minimum(red) in the row in question.", "Now let\u2019s see how much of their time each step of the data pipeline is taking.", "Q34 \u2014 During a data science project, approximately what proportion of your time is devoted to the following activities?", "What kind of tools and software do they use?", "Q12 \u2014 What is the primary tool that you use to analyze data?", "Nah! You just haven\u2019t studied enough!", "Let\u2019s take the Data Scientist role as a reference and explore the way other roles relate to it. The answers to Question Nr.26 helps us estimate each individual\u2019s self assessment:", "Q26 \u2014 Do you consider yourself to be a data scientist?", "We can estimate each role\u2019s similarity to the Data Scientist role using our LDA feature-space by calculating the Euclidean distance between the cluster centroids.", "Now that we have a general idea of what each role entails and have seen the way they seen themselves, let\u2019s plot against each other the \u201cSelf Assessed\u201d, perceived similarity and the actual similarity between each role and the Data Scientist role.", "The size of the bubble represents the size of the group, the X axis represents the distance of the group to the Data Scientist role measured by self-assessment (Q26 \u2014 Are you a Data Scientist?), the Y axis represents the distance of the group to the Data Scientist role.", "In the following lines I\u2019m going to dig into data about the Data Science job market. I combined the Kaggle Survey Data with a slice of a larger data set I\u2019m currently working on, costisting of more than 1500 Data-related job postings with technology-stack information. The postings were scraped from StackOverflow over the past 2 years. The only information I\u2019ve kept is the title and the technology stacks. Comparing this set to the survey results gave me the perfect opportunity to explore how the community fullfills the skill demands of the data-job market.", "Data Science is a booming, rapidly evolving field, most of the associated technologies and frameworks are recent and haven\u2019t matured yet. For example Tensorflow, a leader in symbolic math and neural-network technology was released only 3 years ago. Given the extremely dynamic nature of the Data Science technology stacks, I\u2019m going to focus only on developers under 10 years of experience. I believe that above this level technology stacks play a less and less important role in employability, the expectation of knowing a specific set of languages and technologies gives way to less measurable skills such as architecture, management, domain specific experience, and so on.", "So let\u2019s see for example how the skill stack of a Data Scientist evolves over time. I assumed a \u201cblank-page\u201d start, with zero skills, but this is rarely the case. Usually people are already familiar with a few programming languages before starting using the code for data analysis.", "I created 5 groups based on the individual\u2019s experience:", "To find out the other part of the story, let\u2019s take a look at the requirements of Data-related job postings. The original data set I used consists of over 30.000 entries. Selecting the ones releveant to the Data Science field wasn\u2019t a straightforward process. I tried to limit the selection to those containing Machine Learning, Data Science or Big Data related terms. The filtered results can be found in the dataset I published on Kaggle. Here is a breakdown of the percentages of numbers of requirements:", "Time is limited so we have to decide carefully in which skills to invest it to maximize our chances on the job market. The next section intends to help us select these skills by analysing their frequency in the data set.", "I visualized the top 50 technologies by percent of users familiar with the technology in question (Supply) and percent of job requirements mentioning it (Demand). Technologies which appear in both lists are connected with gray ribbons. The gray-colored skills are the ones missing from either the Supply or the Demand column.", "I decided not to include some of the terms which I found too general, but nonetheless these concepts are among the top 50 most important things required by employers. In order of importance: Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud, Sys Admin, Agile, Algorithm, NoSQL, Database, Data Science, REST, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Web-Services, Testing, Computer Vision, QA, Security, Automation, Design, Microservices, DevOps, Data Warehouse, NLP, Statistics, ETL, Data, Neural Network, Time Series, Data Modeling, UI, JSON, Apache, CI and API.", "The importance of each skill varies between the roles, so while it\u2019s useful to have an overview, breaking down the supply and demand by job title gives us a more valuable insight:", "Nobody in their right mind would start learning programming by working with MapReduce or Hadoop. Yout first need to learn the ABC before starting writing a novel, they say. So if there is a natural order in learning these skills, can we reveal this underlying sequentiality from the data?", "Association Rules might give us some answers. The goal of Association Rule Mining is the identification of patterns of cooccurrences between items based on their individual occurrence probability vs. their simultaneous occurrence probability. If RStudio for example appears in almost every stack where R is present, but the opposite is not true, we could presume that R is a prerequisite for RStudio. Here is a graph of the associations identified above a predefined confidence threshold, the weight of the edges represent the confidence, the size of the nodes and the vertical position both represent the occurrence frequency of that specific skill.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the most probable stacks at each experience level. To measure the employability chances of the stack we will use a simple metric: we get one point for knowing the first skill of a requirement set, two points for the second, three for the third and so on. This way deeper stacks will get a proper boost. The final score is the sum of all points a candidate receives for each of the job requirements.", "Of course deep knowledge of a handful of technologies will always beat superficial familiarity with several, but depth is much harder to measure than breadth so I will stick to comparing stacks based on the number skills matching a requirement.", "Let\u2019s start the Game as a Junior Data Engineer with a moderate number of skills. We know the average tech stack size of a person on the next level (Mid-level), so let\u2019s pick the same number of skills from each category and try to maximize our employability. We will then compare the results of our picks to the average score of a person on the next level.", "What happens if we start with a clean slate and get the choose all skills from scratch to fill the stack of a Senior Data Scientist?", "Your home for data science.
