I questioned how this move would affect the continuation of football activities if the campus was closed to students. Thankfully, after returning to in-person learning, the numbers on the Notre Dame dashboard show positive tests have fallen and remained stable. However, the threat of another cluster remains, especially as classes and football present a taste of normalcy. Other football powerhouses did not take such swift action. For example, the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa (aka Alabama) continued in person learning through a major cluster. The UA system released a report with some optimism on a drop of weekly cases. This is good news and hopefully that trend continues, however, 6.1% of the student population at Alabama has already tested positive. That\u2019s a lot. The burning question to administrators of the school is what amount of positive tests are enough to shut campus?", "Alabama has already announced it is allowing 20% capacity at home football games. That\u2019s over 20K people!! I believe many schools cannot justify hosting fans at football games, while students are restricted from campus and learning remotely. Therefore, schools will have two choices; remove fans from home games or regardless of outbreak size keep in person learning. Now which do you think school administrators will prefer?", "The cost of coaches in college football has been increasing in step with increasing revenues. If students were required to pay football coaches salaries then at Alabama each student would shell out at least $441.38 per year. This number does not include the costs associated with other pieces of a program including stadium maintenance, other staff, travel, or scholarship costs.", "Football is the lifeblood of many athletic departments and acts as a draw for many students as part of the campus experience. The costs associated with COVID are also a serious concern. While the deaths rate of college age demographics is low relative to the general population, COVID can have serious long term effects. About 15% of college athletes that contract COVID develop heart inflammation a potentially long term health disorder. How many students will develop similar conditions?", "We know high risk activities such as air travel and well, football, increase the likelihood of contracting COVID. How many out-of conference and out-of state games are being played this season? This article creates networks using NetworkX to find out. The complete 2020 season schedule can be download from the collegefootballdata.com api using the command below:", "The total number of FBS games this season is 413. There are 91 teams (including some FCS teams) participating in the FBS games. To build the networks, we use NetworkX and matplotlib. There are 322 conference games versus 91 non-conference games this season. Who are playing the non-conference games this season? To find out, we filter all in conference games than create a graph object and apply colors based on a team\u2019s conference.", "In the network above, the FBS Independent teams play the most out of conference games this year (no surprise there). Interestedly, Notre Dame is still classified as FBS Independent, despite playing an ACC schedule, making South Florida as the only non-conference contest.", "Travel out of state is likely to be a huge issue this year as some state become hot beds of infection. How many games are played between teams of different states? It turns out 86.2% or 356 games require a team to cross state lines. We filter out games that occur between teams from the same state than create a graph object and apply colors based on a team\u2019s region.", "There is a lot of travel happening between states. Which state has the most teams coming in from across state lines? That would be Florida, just eking out Texas, with teams from 16 different states coming to the sunshine state for a football game. All the code, data, and figures can be found on the project GitHub.", "The college football landscape is uncertain and the influx of fans, students, and players may spell COVID hot spots this Fall. I expect to see many colleges that are currently in person to go remote or hybrid after the football season. The cost of going to these models early would mean removing fans from home games. Some althetic departments and school administrators simply cannot lose out on football revenues to fund their coaching staffs yearly salaries some upwards of tens of millions of dollars. I believe COVID will cause many athletes to question the amateurism model as schools will appear to be valuing football dollars over student health. Here is hoping the season can continue without any significant outbreaks on teams or in student populations.", "P.S. Bring back the NCAA Football video game!!!", "My name is Cody Glickman and I can be found on LinkedIn. Be sure to check out some of my other articles below:", "Your home for data science.
