You can check out the code for this project on my github. Feel free to contact me with any questions!", "In this series of posts, I\u2019m looking at a few handy NLP techniques, through the lens of Harry Potter. Previous posts in this series on basic NLP looked at Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Regular Expressions, and my next post will look at sentiment analysis.", "Hermione interrupted them. \u201cAren\u2019t you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History?\u201d", "How many times throughout the Harry Potter series does Hermione bug Harry and Ron to read the enormous tome Hogwarts, A History? Hint: it\u2019s a lot. How many nights do the three of them spend in the library, reading through every book they can find to figure out who Nicolas Flamel is, or how to survive underwater, or preparing for their O.W.L.s? The mistake they\u2019re all making is to try to read everything themselves.", "Remember when you were in school and stumbled upon the CliffsNotes summary of that book you never read but were supposed to write an essay about? That\u2019s basically what text summarization does: provide the CliffsNotes version for any large document. Now, CliffsNotes have been written by rather well-educated people who are familiar with the book they\u2019re summarizing. But this is the twenty-first century, aren\u2019t computers supposed to be putting humans out of work? I looked into a few text summarization algorithms to see if we\u2019re ready to put poor old Clifton out of a job.", "There are two types of text summarization algorithms: extractive and abstractive. All extractive summarization algorithms attempt to score the phrases or sentences in a document and return only the most highly informative blocks of text. Abstractive text summarization actually creates new text which doesn\u2019t exist in that form in the document. Abstractive summarization is what you might do when explaining a book you read to your friend, and it is much more difficult for a computer to do than extractive summarization. Computers just aren\u2019t that great at the act of creation. To date, there aren\u2019t any abstractive summarization techniques which work suitably well on long documents. The best performing ones merely create a sentence based upon a single paragraph, or cut the length of a sentence in half while maintaining as much information as possible. Often, grammar suffers horribly. They\u2019re usually based upon neural network models. This post will focus on the much more simple extractive text summarization techniques.", "Most of the algorithms I\u2019ll present are packaged together in the sumy package for Python but I also use one summarizer from the Gensim package and one other technique I wrote myself using LDA topic keywords to enrich the sumy EdmundsonSummarizer. All examples output five-sentence summaries of the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. See my Jupyter notebook for complete code. And a word of caution: don\u2019t judge the results too harshly. They\u2019re not great\u2026 (text summarization does seem to work better on drier works of non-fiction)", "LexRank is an unsupervised approach that gets its inspiration from the same ideas behind Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm. The authors say it is \u201cbased on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences\u201d, using \u201ca connectivity matrix based on on intra-sentence cosine similarity.\u201d Ok, so in a nutshell, it finds the relative importance of all words in a document and selects the sentences which contain the most of those high-scoring words.", "One of the first text summarization algorithms was published in 1958 by Hans Peter Luhn, working at IBM research. Luhn\u2019s algorithm is a naive approach based on TF-IDF and looking at the \u201cwindow size\u201d of non-important words between words of high importance. It also assigns higher weights to sentences occurring near the beginning of a document.", "Latent Semantic Analysis is a relatively new algorithm which combines term frequency with singular value decomposition.", "TextRank is another text summarizer based on the ideas of PageRank, and was also developed at the same time as LexRank, though by different groups of people. TextRank is a bit more simplistic than LexRank; although both algorithms are very similar, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step to remove sentences with highly duplicitous.", "In 1969, Harold Edmundson developed the summarizer bearing his name. Edmundson\u2019s algorithm was, along with Luhn\u2019s, one of the seminal text summarization techniques. What sets the Edmundson summarizer apart from the others is that it takes into account \u201cbonus words\u201d, words stated by the user as of high importance; \u201cstigma words\u201d, words of low importance or even negative importance; and \u201cstop words\u201d, which are the same as used elsewhere in NLP processing. Edmundson suggested using the words in a document\u2019s title as bonus words. Using the chapter title as bonus words, this is what Edmundson outputs:", "Another addition I made was to use LDA to extract topic keywords, and then add those topic keywords back in as additional bonus words. With this modification, the Edmundson results are as follows:", "The SumBasic algorithm was developed in 2005 and uses only the word probability approach to determine sentence importance. Sorry, but it\u2019s pretty bad on this document.", "Wow. That\u2019s terrible. Ahem, moving on\u2026", "The KLSum algorithm is a greedy method which adds sentences to the summary as long as the KL Divergence (a measure of entropy) is decreasing.", "The Reduction algorithm is another graph-based model which values sentences according to the sum of the weights of their edges to other sentences in the document. This weight is computed in the same way as it is in the TexRank model.", "The Gensim package for Python includes a summarizer which is a modification of the TextRank algorithm. Gensim\u2019s approach modifies the sentence similarity function.", "So which algorithm do you think provides the best summary? There are a lot of parameters to tweak before making a final judgement. Some might perform better on shorter summaries, some on longer summaries. The style of writing could make a difference (I mentioned before that I\u2019ve had better luck summarizing non-fiction than fiction). But if you\u2019re Harry just entering Hogwarts\u2019 library with the intent to answer some question and are intimidated by \u201cthe sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows\u201d, then it couldn\u2019t hurt to have a couple summaries available with a few mouse clicks.
