In my earlier post, I shared about how the lack of clearly defined/aligned goals can lead to failures. In this post, I want to talk about a trap I often fall into \u2014 a temptation to solve almost every problem using algorithms.", "We, humans, are born problem seekers and problem solvers. Our brains experience a high when we solve something that others are not able to. While the non-data scientist-population uses analytical, logical, and experiential learning to solve problems, data scientists have undergone training in practice in theories, techniques, and application methodologies. It is not just the training and the skill that tempts data scientists.", "With all these, data scientists are like skilled carpenters, who have the best tools in their hands and standing in front of barks of wood. Every piece of wood looks like a candidate for a piece of art. Every problem looks irresistible to be touched and to be solved.", "We have everything that we complained about earlier of not having. AND to Top it all \u2014 We have problems to solve in every business. Both real and made-up problems. So, why not we solve all of it? This is the exact trap we fall into- A Trap called, \u201cSolving ALL Problems with Data Science\u201d", "\u201cTo someone with a hammer, everything looks like a nail\u201d-Mark Twain", "Many times, saying a \u201cno\u201d at the very beginning is the right thing to do \u2014 for the company, for the team, and for yourself. Still, however, the pressure to survive, the pressure to prove most often takes us in the direction of \u201cLet\u2019s try the best\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s see what we can do\u201d \u2014 which ends up teams failing themselves and their customers \u2014 have lost money and time \u2014 and leaving everyone with frustration, and also trust in technology/data science.", "What is right \u2014 is to spend time qualifying problems, carefully assessing them, and most importantly pushing aside the ones that are candidates for wasted time and effort. Here is a list of those, from my experiences.", "There are problems and then there are constraints. Sometimes, in the name of solving problems, we try to solve the constraints.", "In one of my sales forecasting projects, my team and I were asked to model the anticipated path of a brewing hurricane and use that in the forecasting algorithm. The goal was to predict which stores are likely to be in the path of the hurricane, and what products will need to be sent to them and when.", "Here is the justification \u2014 We have past weather data, we have hurricane forecasts and we have a history of customer\u2019s shopping behavior during past hurricanes, Sure we can come with a forecast. As we went about solving, here is what we learned:", "Expert opinion, at times, is superior to even sophisticated machine learning models. Expensive learning after months of work! Keep an openmind for alternate approaches, early on!", "There is no such thing out there that cannot benefit from an \u201cIncremental Improvement\u201d. And that there is another trap. Most times, in the pretext of an incremental improvement, projects pick up problems with the least ROI.", "I have been witness to retailer business teams\u2019 ask for a 104-week sales forecast.", "How is it going to be used for what? : Most times, excepting products that have long lead time planning, this forecast is primarily needed for budgeting reasons. With so many factors playing into retailing, that number for the 104th week is just a guideline.", "How much does the forecast accuracy matter: The question then is \u2014 Why do we want to invest in building a sophisticated model to forecast for 2 years out.", "Learning: I learned it is important to ask the uncomfortable questions. \u201cYes. It is a gap/problem. But, How big is it? Are there other things that are more worthy of solving? \u201c We ended up with a simple estimation approach using last year\u2019s actuals adjusted for projected growth/de-growth", "Sometimes, simple excel based solutions work better than complex statistical models.", "I once led a project where the request was to predict how long it will take for a product imported from overseas to reach a customer in the US. The goal was to be able to communicate to the customer and/or the retail store, the expected delivery date. At the outset, it seemed like a great candidate for data science. But, not until we found two inherent reasons that impact the desired accuracy of prediction.", "We don\u2019t have to assume that every request to a data science team mean it has to be solved using complex statistical models.", "One time, I was asked to work on predicting hourly inventory position in the stores, so that products at stores do not go out of stock. For this large company, whose supply chain was wholly designed for economies of scale, when trucks leave the warehouse only once daily, solving for an hourly inventory position does not do any help.", "Yes, it is possible to build a sophisticated algorithm to solve for that \u2014 but it is not going to be used. So, this failed the \u201chow are we going to use it?\u201d test.", "Learning: Always ask for how the insights would be actioned.", "There are times where insights demand actions that are not aligned to overall company strategy and direction.This is setting up the project for failure.", "Another big mistake that we do in data science projects is to not thoroughly assess the availability of critical data required to produce outcomes. Though we all know that garbage in = garbage out, we cannot avoid being tempted to make this mistake.", "This was a project to decide the \u201cright\u201d selling price for 1000s of the bedding line of products.", "Approach and Inherent Flaw: The approach that we took was to use data that was available, which was just historical sales. Yes, the historical data had information on how size, fabric, thread count, color, patterns were factored in historical retail prices, and how sales reacted to it.", "Missing piece: The most important data in deciding the right price for an item is the customer\u2019s perception of the product. In other words, how many extra dollars is the customer willing to pay for this product compared to the one that is one level inferior to this one. What are the parameters in a customer\u2019s mind that decide if the product is inferior or superior compared to the other? How much is the customer willing to invest in a master bedroom bedding (usually king size) versus the guest bedroom? These data points are best collected through elaborate surveys or from data created using a simulated shopping environment.", "Learning: Using prior shopping patterns is trying to trick the model into thinking that customer decisions are the same.", "Missing a critical data element and deciding to \u201clet's try our best with what is available\u201d leads to wasted effort and time.", "There is no denying that data science can produce transformational impacts. Companies have relied on their extensive investments in advanced analytics, AI to revive businesses, expand into newer territories.", "However, the impact that data science creates is directly proportional to the type and relevance of the problem solved. A lot of time has to be spent in qualifying the problem .", "We should remember that data science professionals just not have the responsibility to solve scenarios but also have a much bigger responsibility of choosing which ones to go after.", "\u201cSuccessful problem solving requires finding the right solution to the right problem. We fail more often because we solve the wrong problem than because we get the wrong solution to the right problem.\u201d- Russell L. Ackoff", "Let's resolve to bring the best of data, computing, and machine learning to drive truly-impactful outcomes.
