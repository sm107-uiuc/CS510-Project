Scam messages typically trick people into giving away money or personal details by offering an attractive or false deal. Based on the statistics from the Singapore Police Force, from January till June 2020, the amount cheated through scams have increased by more than S$8 million!", "A spam message classification is a step towards building a tool for scam message identification and early scam detection.", "The dataset is from Kaggle, a collection of spam SMS messages, with 5572 messages, all classified as either \u2018ham\u2019 or \u2018spam\u2019 . The dataset contains 13.4% spam and 86.6% ham.", "With the help of the NLTK package, every message is word-tokenized. Conversion to lower case is carried out, punctuation is removed except exclamation mark, stopwords and words containing digits are removed too.", "The example above shows a \u2018cleaned\u2019 message after all pre-processing steps.", "The top 20 words used in spam and ham messages are illustrated using horizontal bar plots.", "It can be seen that words common in spam messages are not commonly observed in ham messages. The percentage of occurrence of spam words are very high too in spam messages.", "Topic modeling has also been used on the \u2018cleaned\u2019 text to discover the topics that occur in the collection of text (usually known as documents in NLP terms).", "Here, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to classify the documents into 2 topics. As seen below, the words in topic 0 seem to suggest that the topic is Ham and words in topic 1 seem to suggest that the topic is Spam.", "Topic modeling is a useful technique for reducing dimensions before applying classification models.", "The models used are Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, Random Forest classifier, Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes classifier and Complement Na\u00efve Bayes classifier.", "Count Vectorizer is used to encode the documents into vectors as input into the models for training and test. In addition, Tfidf vectorizer, Count Vectorizer with Latent Semantic Analysis, Count Vectorizer with Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been used with the Logistic Regression model.", "The data is split into 80% train and validation set, 20% test set. GridSearch CV is applied across 10 folds on the data, to find the best hyperparameters for all the models. Prediction is based on the average of 10 predictions.", "Precision is the fraction of true spam messages out of the captured spam messages.", "The models that have 100% precision are Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, Random Forest classifier.", "Random Forest classifier model has also improved its accuracy from 99% to 100% with the inclusion of the exclamation mark in the text.", "Recall is the fraction of true spam messages captured out of the total true spam messages present.", "The Bernoulli Na\u00efve Bayes classifier and Complement Na\u00efve Bayes classifier have the highest recall score of 0.93.", "F1 score is the measure of the model\u2019s accuracy based on precision and recall.

Precision is valued over recall so that ham messages will not be misclassified as spam.", "A more customized pre-processing step will contribute to a more precise model.", "For this dataset, linear models with high bias and low variance like the Logistic Regression and Na\u00efve Bayes classifier have performed better than non-linear models like k-Nearest Neighbor classifier and Random Forest classifier.", "Special thanks to my main Metis instructor Mr. Neo Han Wei for the guidance and patience given in this entire boot camp.
