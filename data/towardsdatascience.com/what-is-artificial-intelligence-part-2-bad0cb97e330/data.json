As we shall see, Alan Turing has a credible right to be called not only the father of computer science but one of the earliest pioneers in artificial intelligence (or machine intelligence, as he would have called it). For this reason, I devote considerable attention to his brief but remarkable career, including some biographical details.", "I repeat my disclaimer that I am not a professional historian. Instead, I hope this series of articles inspires others to further study this fascinating history, as well as providing insight into what \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d actually means.", "In 1936, Alan Turing published one of the landmark papers in the history of science, \u201cOn Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungproblem\u201d [1]. In it, he described what he called \u201cthe universal computing machine\u201d. In his honor, this theoretical construct is now called the universal Turing machine, and it is not only of theoretical interest: Many consider it to be the foundational idea of modern computers.", "Turing\u2019s early work in computational science is relevant to AI because it brought forward the idea of computation represented by Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine. Turing\u2019s paper proved from a mathematical perspective the possibility of general computation performed by a single machine. That is, Turing proved that any number or sequence that can be computed, can be computed by a single type of machine, the so-called universal Turing machine. While this may not prove that machines can think, it shows that machines for general computational tasks can be devised (at least in theory).", "On 4 September 1939, the day after France and the UK declared war on Germany, Turing moved from Cambridge to Bletchley Park, headquarters of the UK\u2019s Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS) [3]. There he became the principal designer of the code-breaking machine Bombe, which was used to decipher codes from the German Enigma cipher machine.", "The story of the Enigma and the Bombe is a long and interesting one, but it is already well documented. I will recount only the essential details. I refer the interested reader to Jack Copeland\u2019s excellent book The Essential Turing and references cited therein [3].", "What I would like to explore briefly in this article is the connection between Turing\u2019s work and the development of AI, which I believe sheds light on the concept of what AI actually is.", "In many ways, the Bombe can be thought of as a primitive implementation of machine learning. A Bombe was a machine that houses elements replicating several copies of an Enigma, built for the purpose of discovering keys that would unlock coded German messages. It used heuristic search to find a candidate key that would solve a certain set of constraints (i.e. a heuristic, represented by the specific set-up of the Bombe), and then a human operator would check whether this key, applied to the coded message, would produce coherent German. Turing would later conjecture that \u201cintellectual activity consists mainly of various kinds of search.\u201d [4].", "I argue that the above procedure was a primitive form of machine learning because this is, at a high level, what many machine learning algorithms do today: (1) select a configuration from a large set of possible configurations, representing parameters to a function that satisfie certain constraints, (2) check/measure the candidate solution (i.e. parameter set) according to some measure of correctness, (3) repeat as necessary, and (4) once satisfied with the performance, use the chosen configuration as a model for computing some output on other yet unseen data.", "There are three major differences between the Bombe and modern machine learning, not so much in procedure but in implementation. First, the Bombe required that a human operator set up the machine using cables connecting different components (see figure above), in order to impose certain constraints/heuristics. A human was also required to transfer the candidate \u201csolution\u201d to a separate machine (a replica Enigma), in order to try to decipher a full German message. In principle, these manual steps could have been also automated, but in this time period, it was probably easier to have a human operator perform them than build/extend a machine to perform the same tasks.", "Secondly, whereas the Bombe could select and check 17,576 configurations in about two hours [3], modern machine learning performed on modern computers can perform this type of procedure millions of times per second in many cases (the details depend, of course, on the number of parameters, the function between computed, size of computer, etc.).", "Thirdly, the Bombe was a machine designed to perform a particular task (i.e. learning keys to Enigma codes), and it could be used only for that task. Today, we usually execute machine learning tasks on general purpose computers, which can be \u201creconfigured\u201d for other tasks simply by loading other programs into memory.", "Still, despite the manual nature and \u201cslowness\u201d of the Bombe in modern terms, it represented a major advancement in automation and computational speed for its particular task, compared to anything that existed prior to that point. Note that there were other computational machines in existence at this time, such as the IBM 601. I\u2019m not sure it is possible though to make an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of computational speed between different machines of this era like we do today. Lastly, I\u2019d like to point out that the Bombe was based closely on the design of an early Enigma-cracking machine, the Bomba, designed by Polish mathematicians.", "Before moving on to other topics, I want to point out that in a span of only three or four years, Turing shifted from the very theoretical (On Computable Numbers) to the highly practical (cracking German military communications). In the words of the official historian of the British Secret Service, Sir Harry Hinsley:", "I won\u2019t say that what Turing did made us win the war, but I daresay we might have lost it without him.", "We also know that in early 1941 the UK was at risk of running out of food and other basic supplies, due to attacks on ships by German U-boats. At that time, the Naval version of Enigma had not been cracked and many thought it to be unbreakable, but finally when Turing\u2019s team began regularly decoding Naval Enigma messages in June 1941, British ships were able to be successfully routed away from the U-boats [3]. Disaster was averted.", "If these outcomes\u2014\u200ahelping the British population avert starvation and the Allies to win WWII\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t epitomize practical research, I don\u2019t know what does. In my view, the highly practical nature of his work near the beginning of Turing\u2019s tragically short career was highly impactful for the development of AI. Had Turing continued in a more theoretical vein, the field may not have developed as rapidly as it did during the period of 1941\u20131953, which we will now explore.", "According to interviews with Donald Michie, who worked with Turing at Bletchley Park, Turing began pondering \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d as early as 1941. He circulated a paper on machine intelligence among his colleagues at GC & CS, but this is now lost. We also know that towards the end of 1941, there were not many theoretical problems concerning Enigma left for Turing to work on, so he began to work on other problems, joining the Enigma team only for brief periods [3].", "In November 1942, Turing went to the US, where (among other assignments) he worked at Bell Labs on speech encryption. There he met Claude Shannon, whom we will cover in Part 3. Turing returned to the UK in March 1943 and continued to work mostly on automatic speech encryption until the end of the war.", "Although Turing\u2019s 1936 paper On Computable Numbers described a universal computer machine, it was not intended as a practical design for a computer. In October 1945, Turing joined the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) to work on such a design. In late 1945, Turing produced a technical report titled \u201cProposed Electronic Calculator,\u201d which specified the design of such a machine in great detail (see image below). In this report, he also raises the topic of machine intelligence, describing what would become a \u201cclassic\u201d AI problem:", "Given a position in chess the machine could be made to list all the \u2018winning combinations\u2019 to a depth of about three moves on either side. This\u2026raises the question \u2018Can the machine play chess?\u2019 It could fairly easily be made to play a rather bad game. It would be bad because chess requires intelligence. We stated at the beginning of this section that the machine should be treated as entirely without intelligence. There are indications however that it is possible to make the machine display intelligence at the risk of its making occasional serious mistakes. By following up this aspect the machine could probably be made to play very good chess.", "When a pilot version of this machine, which was eventually named the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE; in homage to Babbage), was built in May 1950, it was the world\u2019s fastest computer, running at 1 MHz [3, p. 367]. Another computer, built using the same basic principles as Turing\u2019s ACE design, is the Bendix G15, considered by some to be the first personal computer.", "When Turing was designing the ACE, machine intelligence was at the forefront of his mind, as seen in a letter to W. Ross Ashby (see image above), circa 1946:", "In working on the ACE I am more interested in the possibility of producing models of the action of the brain than in the practical applications to computing\u2026", "\u2026It would be quite possible for the machine to try out variations of behaviour and accept or reject them in the manner you describe and I have been hoping to make the machine do this\u2026The ACE is in fact analogous to the \u2018universal machine\u2019 described in my paper on computable numbers. This theoretical possibility is attainable in practice\u2026Thus, although the brain may in fact operate by changing its neuron circuits\u2026. we could nevertheless make a model, within the ACE, in which this possibility was allowed for\u2026", "On 20 February 1947, Turing gave a lecture on the ACE to the London Mathematical Society. We know something about this lecture through a draft copy, which is available from [5] and has been reprinted in several volumes (e.g. [7] and [3]). Not only is this the first known public lecture to describe machine intelligence, Turing also clearly articulated the concept of machine learning:", "It has been said that computing machines can only carry out the processes that they are instructed to do\u2026It is also true that the intention in constructing these machines in the first instance is to treat them as slaves, giving them only jobs which have been thought out in detail\u2026Up till the present machines have only been used in this way. But is it necessary that they should always be used in such a manner?", "Let us suppose we have set up a machine with certain initial instruction tables [i.e. programs], so constructed that these tables might on occasion, if good reason arose, modify those tables\u2026Possibly it might still be getting results of the type desired when the machine was first set up, but in a much more efficient manner\u2026It would be like a pupil who had learnt much from his master, but had added much by his own work. When this happens I feel that one is obliged to regard the machine as showing intelligence. As soon as one can provide a reasonable large memory capacity it should be possible to begin to experiment on these lines\u2026What we want is a machine that can learn from experience.", "(Boldface added by me for emphasis.)", "Mostly due to internal politics and mismanagement of the ACE project by NPL, it took until May 1950 to complete a \u2018pilot model\u2019 of the ACE.", "In July 1947, while still employed by the NPL, Turing left for a twelve-month sabbatical at University of Cambridge. The purpose of this leave is best expressed by the Director of NPL, Sir Charles Darwin [5]:", "[Turing] wants to extend his work on the machine still further towards the biological side. I can best describe it by saying that hitherto the machine has been planned for work equivalent to that of the lower parts of the brain, and he wants to see how much a machine can do for the higher ones; for example, could a machine be made that could learn by experience?", "After returning from this sabbatical, Turing produced a report titled, \u201cIntelligent Machinery.\u201d This is a highly original work, introducing ideas such as genetic algorithms and neural networks (what he called \u201cunorganised machines\u201d) with learning capabilities, and reinforcement learning. Rather than giving a detailed summary, I will just quote Turing\u2019s own summary that appears at the end of the report:", "The possible ways in which machinery might be made to show intelligent behaviour are discussed. The analogy with the human brain is used as a guiding principle. It is pointed out that the potentialities of the human intelligence can only be realised if suitable education is provided. The investigation mainly centres round an analogous teaching process applied to machines. The idea of an unorganised machine is defined, and it is suggested that the infant human cortex is of this nature. Simple examples of such machines are given, and their education by means of rewards and punishments is discussed. In one case the education process is carried through until the organisation is similar to that of an ACE.", "Turing never published the report, but again it is available via [5] and several anthologies (i.e. [8] and [3]).", "Frustrated with the slow progress, Turing left his position at the NPL in 1948 to join the Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester.", "The Computing Machine Laboratory was set up by Max Newman (another veteran of Bletchley Park) in 1946. When Turing joined, they were deep into the development of the \u201cManchester Baby,\u201d which became the world\u2019s first stored-program computer when it ran its first program on 21 June 1948. Although I won\u2019t go into the details of Turing\u2019s contributions to the early computers developed in Manchester, it should suffice to say that his influence was substantial.", "Turing\u2019s most famous achievements during the period of 1948\u20131953 were a series of articles and public lectures on the topic of machine intelligence, including the article \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d published in 1950 in the leading philosophy journal Mind. In this article, the famous \u201cimitation game\u201d was proposed, which is now known as the Turing Test:", "I propose to consider the question, \u2018Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms \u2018machine\u2019 and \u2018think\u2019\u2026Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.", "The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the \u2018imitation game\u2019. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman\u2026The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B\u2026", "After giving some examples of the type of questions the interrogator might ask, Turing continues:", "We now ask the question, \u2018What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\u2019 Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, \u2018Can machines think?\u2019", "The remainder of the article describes various possible objections to the idea that machines can think and Turing\u2019s rebuttals to these objections. There is also a chapter on \u201cLearning Machines,\u201d which is largely an expansion on the ideas he outlined in his 1948 article. He closes the article with an insightful observation:", "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.", "In 1951, gave several radio presentations broadcast by the BBC, including one titled \u201cIntelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\u201d and a second one titled \u201cCan Digital Computers Think?\u201d In 1952, he participated in a panel discussion broadcast on BBC with the topic \u201cCan Automatic Calculating Machines Be Said To Think?\u201d. Other panelists included Richard Braithwaite (a philosopher), Geoffrey Jefferson (a neurosurgeon), and Max Newman.", "During this time period, Turing also became interested in the topic of Artificial Life. This is a bit beyond the scope of the current article, so I won\u2019t attempt to summarize his work in this area. In 1953, he published a short essay titled \u201cChess\u201d, culminating several years of effort in programming a computer to play chess. Finally, in 1954, Turing published his last article, titled \u201cSolvable and Unsolvable Problems,\u201d published in Science News, a journal that popularized science. The purpose of this article was to present his earlier and perhaps most lasting contribution On Computable Numbers to a general audience.", "In 1952 Turing was brought to trial and convicted of homosexual acts, which were a criminal offense in the UK at that time. On 8 June 1954, Turing was found dead in his home. Although the death was ruled a suicide, this finding has been the subject of controversy [9].", "Despite his short life and career, Turing\u2019s impact on human and computer ingenuity is lasting. I\u2019d like to close with a quote of Turing from an article in The Times, dated 11 June 1949:", "This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be. We have to have some experience with the machine before we really know its capabilities. It may take years before we settle down to the new possibilities, but I do not see why it should not enter any of the fields normally covered by the human intellect and eventually compete on equal terms.", "[1] Turing, A.
