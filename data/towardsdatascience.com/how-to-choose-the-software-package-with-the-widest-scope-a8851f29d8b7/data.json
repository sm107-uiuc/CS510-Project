Go crazy, ask yourself what-if I want to take this and that, and combine/compare/compose them together in a minimal effort? Most likely someone else, a domain expert, has already figured a good way to solve it. They may have needed to wrap it under fancy software structure that is not intuitive to begin with and has its own lingo. Is it worth learning it, and leverage on the wide-scope solutions you are likely to discover way down the road? What else characterizes wide-scope packages?", "ML example: You run a machine learning prediction analysis, let\u2019s say as simple as linear regression, and then you wish to compare it to another model, let\u2019s say regularized regression (e.g. ridge, lasso). How do you integrate your code for this? The simplest way may be to \u2018copy -> paste\u2019 your regression model code, change the model part, save the output with a unique name, integrate with the former output (assuming you kept column names and other structure in a unified way), and do the comparison. But the fun only starts here\u2026 what if you want to add more models, where some models also require tuning (selecting best value of the parameter via some optimization process), or, you want to try some ensemble techniques (bagging, boosting, stacking) that is composed of multiple models? Are you still going to do everything from scratch, copy-paste, knitting results from various functions/packages, where each has its own names and structure? Hopefully not\u2026 someone have already found a solution for this challenge, and wrote a package that unifies this cumbersome process, and aggregate your wildest wish list into a single, comprehensive ecosystem, that would do the dirty job for you.", "You run a forecasting model, let\u2019s say ARIMA. You also wish to compare it to ETS. Same as above, how easy is it to create their ensemble by simply specifying the names of the output from the two independent runs, under exact same assumptions, random seed, and other conventions? Then\u2026 you run it for the overall observations in your data set, but you also wish to run it again at each of the stratified sub-groups in your data. You can do it in a loop, but what if the scope of the tool already allows you to indicate what are the nested groups, and will also take it into account when you stratify/re-collapse the analysis.", "In both examples, the goal is to identify the package that already does it, without having to reinvent the wheel, and without investing precious time on wrangling, unifying, and other tedious work that you may be able to avoid. Because\u2026 someone else, a domain expert , has already figured out how to better resolve it. What makes them domain experts? Well, after spending long hours of dealing with such challenges, and not satisfied with current solutions (at that time), motivated them to write their own state of the art solution. They were playing with such tools enough time, which motivated them to design a better way to compose the various components of their software in a seamless fashion.", "How to identify the package with the scope level you need? let\u2019s be greedy\u2026 How to identify the package with the widest scope?", "While you learn a new domain (machine learning, time-series,\u2026) you may not be aware of the rich tools that are existing in the field, or the common problems the field deals with, other than your own task. But as you learn it more, you may run into cool solutions to problems that you are likely to encounter later on.", "To me, it was like\u2026 \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me ahead of time that this is what we are going to do later on\u2026 If I would have known it before, I might have built my tool differently to begin with, so I could add this new feature/solution, without having to change the design (scope) of my tool\u201d.", "So the trick is\u2026 Imagine what are the next steps you want to ask/analyze. In the examples above, it is an ensemble for ML, and weighted-hierarchical/group stratification for time-series. True, you may not need these fancy solutions for your current problem, but typically, a package that was designed to deal with higher-level problems, would also have a good solution for the simple, core, steps/components.", "Where is the catch? no free lunch", "There is, of course, a cost. Identifying, and designing the core blocks of the software (methodology) in a cohesive way is not trivial. Accommodating seamless composition of these blocks usually requires some higher level framework that will have its own learning curve. It may be an object structure, (e.g. Object-oriented class, nested tables/models,\u2026) that are composition of both atomic and non-atomic structures. They will typically have their own unique lingo that you are not familiar with, because\u2026 well, they had to invent it. It\u2019s a new thing, after all. These may not be intuitive to begin with, but were carefully structured to satisfy a unique need by design.", "In my experience, it is worth investing the time learning such complex structure, and leverage on the wide-scope solution, rather than reinvent a suboptimal solution later on when you will face a similar challenge (yes, you will!).", "Wide-scope packages are typically characterized by rich documentation, and dependencies on stable eco-environments (packages), that will make sure your code doesn\u2019t \u2018break\u2019 when stretching it to new limits.", "Wide-scope packages also characterized by lineage of the author\u2019s own experience, in the hard, windy, learning curves. It takes some courage to say the tool I developed so far has a scope creep, so I am going to dump it, and redesign it from scratch, so it better fit to my current scope (which again, in a retrospective might be limited again 5 years from now, when the field expand to wider scope).", "When the package documentation has a table with comparison of features across competing packages, obviously emphasizing its own strengths, ask yourself the following: Is this the scope I need? What is the limit of the package scope? which other eco-environments it depends on, and could be easily integrated with? Does it enable me to stretch it to my own need, and add new features to it?", "If a package attempt to achieve a wide-scope functionality, but is a single function with too many parameter, that wrap other nested steps inside, it may not be your best choice. What distinguish this \u2018wrapper\u2019 function from the wide-scope packages described above is the structure. Crazy-wrapper function may lack the independent design of its components, and their cohesive structure. Crazy-wrapper function is not much expandable to other uses, and only limited to the pre-defined parameters values. Wide-scope function, on the other hand, achieve to avoid this sinkhole thanks to its structure complexity, that enable it to store the various data types and parameters values in a way that nicely integrate with the other components.", "Become a domain expert yourself by leveraging on other domain expert tools. When you ask yourself why the hell did they have to create this odd-looking complex object and term it in a new word, there must be a good reason for it. Be patient, learn it, and enjoy the fruits of the fancy tricks down the road.", "Check my other blog posts and my GitHub page for additional fun reading. LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
