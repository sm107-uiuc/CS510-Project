Somebody with at least an ounce of authority, whether it be a plucky MBA marketing intern or the CEO, is faced with a difficult problem. They schedule a project kickoff meeting with various folks to brainstorm a solution, and know that it will need to be supported by data if it has any chance of being approved by their superiors. Although they make the meeting invite optional for a few folks, they ensure that somebody from the data analytics or science team (henceforth referred to as \u201cdata team\u201d) will be there.", "A quick note: in my opinion, there still isn\u2019t a consensus about the difference between data analytics and data science. The tasks that data analysts perform at one company would fit the job description of data scientists at another. Regardless, know when I refer to the \u201cdata team\u201d for the rest of this article and future ones, I\u2019m describing end users of data who are doing data reporting, analysis and/or modeling to help an organization accomplish its goals. They\u2019re not data engineers, tasked with building, maintaining, and improving data pipelines and other infrastructure. They\u2019re also not machine learning engineers, who are building models that are integrated into the company\u2019s product, such as recommender or algorithmic pricing systems.", "Let\u2019s imagine you\u2019re on this highly demanded data team. On the one hand, you\u2019re directly involved in solving some of the most important problems your company faces. On the other, it\u2019s very possible that some of the problems you\u2019re faced with fall into one of the following unfortunate categories:", "Although progress is being made in natural language processing, creative writing is best left to humans. Brand messaging in particular comes to mind.", "We didn\u2019t get the successful slogans \u201cWhere\u2019s the Beef?\u201d, \u201cJust Do It\u201d, or \u201cGot Milk?\u201d from big data piped into fancy modeling frameworks and dynamic dashboards. In fact, if we imagine that a data and modeling team with access to historical brand advertising campaign performance was heavily involved at the ad agencies of the latter two campaigns, we might have ended up with \u201cWhere\u2019s the Air?\u201d and \u201cWhere\u2019s the Milk?\u201d The goal of these advertisers was to come up with a punchy, original slogan that differentiates themselves from other brands. The algorithmically generated slogans I shared are clearly ridiculous, but they drive home the fact that historical advertising data and typical modeling techniques aren\u2019t appropriate for this problem.", "At best, the data folks who are involved in the project have their time wasted and politely excuse themselves as the project progresses. At worst, they dazzle stakeholders with impressive looking but irrelevant analyses, crowding out the actual work that needs to be done by other project contributors.", "As more data, in particular new datasets, are generated over time and therefore reliance on data for decision making increases, we\u2019ll find ourselves less frequently in this situation than the subsequent ones.", "Now imagine that you\u2019re a junior data scientist assisting the product team at a personal finance startup. You\u2019ve been asked to help them because you\u2019ve been around for a few months, excelled on other projects, and demonstrated that you know your way around your company\u2019s internal datasets. Your company\u2019s current product is a tool that allows people to set budgets and track them by importing and displaying credit card spending. Leadership at your company wants to expand the startup\u2019s offerings and is considering adding either personal loans or an investing platform, but doesn\u2019t have the product development resources to do both. They want to use your data prowess to come up with defensible predictions, such as the addressable audience and predicted loan and investment dollars, to help them pick which product to build.", "Let\u2019s start with the personal loans product. I mentioned above that we have access to credit card spending specifically, but perhaps our dataset, upon further examination, contains repayment history or outstanding balances as well. Using this information, we may be able to determine the number of users on our service who we think would be interested in personal loans for credit card payment consolidation. If we have access to outstanding balances, we could even predict loan amounts. Nice!", "For identifying possible investors on our platform, this is a bit trickier, but we\u2019re creative and tenacious. We could scan through our datasets and identify purchases that likely investors would make, such as subscriptions to investing publications like Barrons, Investors Business Daily, and Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance as well as services like The Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha. For predicting the amounts that could be invested on our prospective platform, we could take our likely investors and applying a few assumptions, predict their income and investible savings. Excellent!", "We walk the rest of the project group through our methodologies and results, impressing a few of the executives with our calm, collected answers to tricky questions. They review the information you\u2019ve provided and make a decision on which product to build and launch using your work. You\u2019re excited about the recognition you got, the inevitable success your company is going to have, and are daydreaming about how to describe this experience for the groundbreaking TED talk you\u2019ll give later in your career.", "But hold your horses, Simon Sinek in training, you missed a few important things. Off the top of my head, here are some issues you didn\u2019t address that could easily affect the choice of product to launch:", "So, what\u2019s the solution? Do we preemptively call out these glaring issues with the proposed analysis during the first project meeting and twiddle our thumbs for a few weeks? No. It turns out that there are some sneaky ways of getting the data we need that can be done instead of or in addition to our internal data analysis:", "Is it fair to have expected one of these parties, either the data scientist or the product team, to have known to seek alternate data to solve the problem? I\u2019d answer no. Much of the coursework that data scientists do to prepare them for their jobs never involves procurement of data. Even before question 1 on problem sets, they\u2019re typically provided the dataset they need to use to complete it. It shouldn\u2019t be their responsibility to advocate for these alternate datasets. Similarly, the responsibility to ask for new data shouldn\u2019t lie with the product folks either. They\u2019re probably concentrating on everything else: strategy, design, development, and the go to market plan. As frustrating as this situation is, I find the next of the three categories outright infuriating.", "In this category, the organization is so close to making the right move, but ends up bungling it anyways. It\u2019s like learning all the concepts covered on the SAT, but bringing the wrong type of pencil to the testing center.", "Let\u2019s imagine in spite of the missteps that our startup in the prior example may have made in decision making, we\u2019ve successfully launched both the personal loans and investing services. Things are going well, and we have a newly hired Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) who wants to impress the CEO.", "The CMO is a self-described creative type and visionary. He always has vague evening plans. He holds a potted plant in front of his face in his LinkedIn profile picture. He didn\u2019t go to Burning Man last year because \u201cthey ruined it\u201d (who\u2019s they?!). And through a combination of intuition, experience, and the long term effects of drug use, he\u2019s unilaterally decided that getting more college students on your site is going to take the company into \u201chypergrowth\u201d mode. He\u2019s got the whole marketing campaign already planned: the Gen Z specific messaging, planned guerrilla marketing tactics by student brand ambassadors, t-shirts, but there\u2019s one issue: the CEO will want to see data that supports doing this big bet. In order to get the data the CMO needs, he needs you.", "One morning, you wake up to a very important e-mail sent by the CMO at 5:53am to you directly. You know it\u2019s very important because he added the very important flag and put \u201cVERY IMPORTANT\u201d in the subject line. He left filling out the data slides of his presentation to the last minute, and needs to know the average lifetime value (LTV) of your company\u2019s active users.", "You\u2019re excited that the sophisticated user level LTV prediction model you built is getting traction, and it\u2019s all the way up through the c-suite no less! You\u2019ve already set up automated reporting on this important metric and rush him back an answer.", "He thanks you and tells you the number is \u201cway better than I expected\u201d and that he owes you a beer, but like a very specific beer that edgy people drink. After he gets your response, he puts the average LTV number on a slide, contrasts it with the much lower customer acquisition cost (CAC) of these college students, and proves that there\u2019s plenty of profit to be made. He knocks his presentation to the CEO out of the park on two hours of sleep. Hypergrowth, here we come!", "Not so fast. Spot the various issues with how your analysis was used? Here are some attributes of the acquired users that were ignored, probably to our detriment:", "The worst part of the whole situation is that we may have been able to use the data we already have to have sent a more accurate estimate of LTV for these users if we had known how the CMO was planning to use our number. We could have subset our LTV predictions dataset to newly signed up college students, both active and inactive, in order to get a better estimate of how much similar users could be worth.", "In all three scenarios, data is being used in ways that don\u2019t best accomplish an organization\u2019s goals. In the brand slogan example, the data team\u2019s efforts distract from the actual work that needs to be done, which doesn\u2019t even require data analysis or modeling. In the personal loans or investment features example, preexisting data is used to decent effect, but new data that needed to be procured would be better. In the marketing acquisition example, the wrong datapoint is used to inform the initiative even though the right one was available.", "As illustrated in the examples, these problems are more frequent and severe because of data illiteracy. The data illiterate come in various forms. Some, like in the first example, expect data to deliver more than it can, acting anywhere between steroid (accelerating growth) to panacea (fixing everything). Others view it as a box to be checked off: \u2611 Used data. In our second example, the product team lets their decision rely entirely on poor data, which I think is reflective of a common attitude: if a decision is informed by data, it must be a good one. In the third example, the decision to attract more college students to our platform has already been made by the CMO. He just needs to deal with the hassle of showing a datapoint to the CEO to get her approval. Large differences in authority between data requester and provider can exacerbate these issues. The higher up the chain the data illiteracy goes, the less likely the data team will clarify \u2014 or outright refuse \u2014 requests.", "The solution, then, is to have somebody explicitly tasked with making sure that data is used responsibly and effectively. This person first determines if data is necessary to accomplish the goals of a project, seeks it out, and even generates or procures it if it isn\u2019t already available.", "I encourage you to spend a little time reflecting on who you would want tasked with these responsibilities. What would their job description look like? What skills and background would you want them to have? Does a similar role or field that does this already exist? All that and more in \u201cWelcome to the data team! Please solve everything. (Part II: The Solution)\u201d, linked below!", "Director of Quantitative Analysis @PandoraMusic. Mentor @Springboard.
