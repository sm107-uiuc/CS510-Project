When I started applying to Masters's programs in Data Science to ultimately obtain my graduate degree, there was a small number of schools offering that option, as well as not many bootcamps, online courses, or certifications. Now, when you search for Data Science \u2014 anything, there are countless options.", "As someone who has practiced in Data Analytics and then eventually on to Data Science, I have been asked several questions about my experiences. In this article, I will be uncovering some of the top questions that people often ask me. Please continue reading below if you would like to find out more about the top 5 questions I get asked as a Data Scientist.", "After realizing a lack of possible growth in my previous career, I looked to branching out in something similar, but different enough to restart my career. I was already working with scientific methods, statistics, mathematics, and experimentation. This realization, along with being fascinated by Data Analytics, led me to search for careers in data and tech fields. I wanted to enter a field that was in tech because it is a steady and important field right now, and probably for a much longer time ahead. All of these characteristics showed search results of Data Science. It was a fairly new term to me at the time; however, I had heard about Artificial Intelligence before, of course, and I made the connections of AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Since I was somewhat starting with programming, I did not want to start immediately in a software-engineering Data Science position, but a more data and business-oriented position. I stuck to Data Science, and eventually found a Master\u2019s program that was somewhat short in time, enrolled, and solidified to myself that I had a new passion. Enrolling in and completing this program in general was an amazing experience after meeting and working with people from other industries and previous careers. Some people were in mathematics, engineering, business, healthcare, and many other fields as well. It was interesting to be a part of this group all using their past experiences and skills to collectively become Data Scientists.", "The top reasons I chose Data Science were because of the following:", "With different companies, comes different everyday work routines. However, there are still consistent tasks and processes that you might encounter as a Data Scientist. At most companies, you can expect to have standup meetings. Yes, this process is true for plenty of tech careers as well. The goal of these meetings usually raises the following questions: what were you working on previously, what are you currently working on, and do you have any blockers. Although simple, these quick questions at the beginning of your workday often help you to summarize to both yourself and your team, the processes you are working on and the possible impact you will have. It is beneficial to have these meetings because the transparency of coworkers is acknowledged and a process can either be helped, stopped, or accelerated. Another common occurrence on a Data Scientist\u2019s schedule is meeting with stakeholders. Before starting a Data Science project and comparing Machine Learning algorithms, you will need to examine the problem at hand. Narrowing down a business problem is incredibly important to both the stakeholder and the Data Scientist. It is useful because it means all parties are on the same page, and expectations can be met.", "An example of a bad problem statement for a Data Scientist is:", "\u2014 our company has some bad processes and we need to use a classification algorithm to make this happen better. Should we use two Machine Learning algorithms?", "An example of a good problem statement for a Data Scientist is:", "\u2014 manually classifying photos takes too long", "The bad example looks okay, right? No. The reason why it is bad is that it offers a solution right away and the problem is vague and long-worded. When you offer the solution before looking at the data and current process, then you are limiting yourself. You want to keep the problem simple, with the ability of interpretation for a future solution. A lot of bad problem statements are not statements, which I see happen frequently. They often will raise a question and pose the solution. A good problem statement on the other hand is straight to the point. If you cannot say what the problem is in one sentence, then your solution will be confusing to yourself as well as to the stakeholders, and eventually to the people who will use your product. Another example with a good problem statement is Facebook \u2014 connecting people from far away is difficult. Here, you can see that there was a whole company built around a simple statement, just to connect people. With the statement, you can eventually research and develop several Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science models that will be utilized in production.", "Here are some processes you can expect to employ as a Data Scientist:", "Data Science can be extremely intimidating. A lot of what you work on will impact the business significantly so you want to avoid mistakes. However, it is best to fail early, and put processes in place where failure can be avoided in the future. You may program in several languages and work with a plethora of different coworkers from your business. Ultimately, yes, Data Science will get easier in the way that you learn that it is okay to make mistakes early and be aware of the problem you are trying to solve. At first, you will implement Machine Learning algorithms into production for the first time. For example, in one job you can solely focus on Random Forest, and in another job, you can focus on Time Series modeling.", "Once you gain more and more experience, you start to realize there is a pattern, of which I described above, in the everyday work bullet points.", "These steps of your day and week, and so on, occur with every model you will implement. You will build a problem statement, query and analyze data, build a baseline model, test several Machine Learning algorithms, pick a final model(s), and put it into production.", "Becoming familiar with the typical Data Science process will make the job easier, as well as gaining experience from not only work but from other avenues as well. Perhaps enrolling in an online course or competing in a Kaggle competition are additional routes for learning and practice you can take. There are a variety of ways to keep sharp and on your Data Science game. Lastly, is to realize that the goal of a Data Scientist is to problem solve and employ the right tools to solve it the best way.", "How does Data Science get easier when it is such a complex field?", "As a Data Scientist, it becomes easier to predict what will happen. However, it is not completely clear where Data Scientist will be in 5 years, other than more Data Scientists in the workforce. I believe the biggest shift will be in education, both in traditional education and in education on the job. In terms of traditional education, more schools and online teaching platforms will provide more education.", "I believe that not only will graduate and undergraduate courses will become more popular, but so will high school and hopefully even middle school curriculums. If younger people are learning Data Science, then they can expedite the growth and possible, positive impacts of Data Science in society. As programming and software engineering becomes incorporated earlier in education, so will Data Science. Perhaps, instead of a Statistics course, you will be able to enroll in a Machine Learning course. For education on the job, I expect more and more people of a business to understand what a Data Scientist actually does and their possible impact. A lot of companies hire Data Scientists and the recruiter or company is unaware of what they actually do, just knowing that it is a popular career to be in and acquire people in. With Data Science and other related fields becoming more popular, the understanding and education of a Data Scientist will increase as well. People will become used to the word algorithm not just in the sense of an artificial intelligence robot in a movie, but a person who problem solves with various tools to help people, processes, and companies. A lot of people will realize they interact with Data Science in some way probably every single day, and with this increase in awareness and knowledge, Data Scientists will be utilized more in more in 5 years, and so on.", "No, but the role of a Data Scientist may change. Data Science already has many branching roles like Computer Vision Engineer, Natural Language Processing Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and several more. I hope to be in Data Science as long as I can be. If I ever diverge away from the exact title of Data Scientist, I will most likely carry on Data Science learnings with me into that new role. For example, if you want to switch to strategy or business development, you could carry over experimentation, impact analysis, and several other tools and traits of Data Science to those careers to ultimately be better at them.", "There were five common Data Science questions I get as a professional Data Scientist. There are countless more questions that are asked, but I want to know what you are asked as well. Please feel free to comment down below what questions you get asked as a Data Scientist. Do you often get asked what I get asked, or are they completely different? In the future, will these still be the top Data Science questions?", "Once again, here are the top five Data Science questions I get asked:", "If you would like to learn more reasons to become a Data Scientist, you can click this link to read more about the top 5 reasons to become a Data Scientist [7]:", "Thank you for reading!
