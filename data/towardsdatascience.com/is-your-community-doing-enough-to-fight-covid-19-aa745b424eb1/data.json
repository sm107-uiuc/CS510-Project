In response, many countries are encouraging residents to stay home and only leave for necessities or essential work.", "Last week, in an effort to track how human behavior has changed in response to COVID-19, Google released mobility reports, which aggregate anonymized geographical movement trends over time. The data, acquired by cell phone location history, tracks activity across several categories including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential spaces. With these reports, we can now see how stay at home ordinances in the United States and globally have impacted behavior and where we can continue to do better to stop the spread.", "According to the updated reports released April 9, global initiatives to reduce human interactions are having a drastic impact on behavior. Worldwide averages show decreases in all public gathering activity and increases in the amount of people at home. Specifically, the reports highlight the following.", "While these numbers represent global averages, at the country level we are seeing variations in the response to the COVID-19. The image below depicts the change in the amount of time spent in residential spaces for all countries that are currently included in Google\u2019s dataset.", "We can see here that although almost all countries have increased the amount of time spent at home, the degree to which people are staying at home varies. Countries such as Panama, Bolvia, Peru, and Botswana have made significant changes with over a 34% increase in staying at home activity. To see additional category statistics such as shopping, work attendance, and visiting parks, scroll over a country.", "In accordance with the recommendation to avoid social gatherings and close proximity between people, within the United States alone, at least 316 million people across 42 states are under direction from local governments to stay at home as much as possible. This equates to roughly 95% of the American population.\u00b2 Google\u2019s reports reveal how these ordinances have impacted behavior across the United States.", "With restaurants, bars, stores, and other workplaces closed across the country, we have seen on average a 40% decrease in workplace attendance and a 49% average decrease in retail and recreational activity. However, people are still regularly leaving their homes for a variety of reasons including because they are essential workers, they need groceries and other necessities, or they are visiting a park. Nationally, we have only seen a 13% average increase in time spent in residential spaces, which is less than the global average of 16.8%. The map below shows how residential activity varies across the United States. In states such as New Jersey and California, we see increases in residential activity of up to 16% while states that have not implemented stay at home ordinances such as Arkansas and Iowa have only increased residential activity by 8%.", "Although the map above visualizes only changes in residential activity, we see strong negative correlation between residential activity and categories that involve public interactions. The heat map below shows that in states where people are spending more time in their residence, they are spending less time shopping, at work, and on public transit, which means they are less often exposed to the virus.", "We are making great strides globally and nationally to restrict public interactions, but the visuals above show that we still have a lot of room for improvement. With the help of Google\u2019s mobility reports, you can now see how your community is responding to COVID-19.
