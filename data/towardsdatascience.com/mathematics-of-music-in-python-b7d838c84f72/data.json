And others just don\u2019t. Can you compose a piece of music if you\u2019re deaf? Which \u201cPhysical construct\u201d of sound makes the melody beautiful?", "Listen to this audio, and tell me what you hear:", "I like playing the piano and I love programming & mathematics. So today I thought, why not blend them together to create something awesome.", "My music will tell you more about me than I ever will", "The audio (above) was synthesized using Numpy and Scipy only! Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not familiar with these Python packages. They\u2019re not that tough to understand.", "In this article, we\u2019ll see how we can generate waves with different frequencies, build our own virtual piano, and play a song. All of this, using our favorite programming language, Python.", "So let\u2019s start with some basics.", "Did you know? Beethoven, one of the most famous composers ever lived, spent most of his career being deaf! He solely relied on his intuition of the patterns that he found working with his audience. He mixed his creativity with the logic of mathematics (sub-consciously) and composed the music that we still cherish.", "For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll use the piano as our reference instrument. So before beginning, here are some basics.", "The anatomy of a keyboard (piano/instrument) is pretty simple. It consists of multiple octaves. An octave is a set of 12 keys \u2014 7 White ones and 5 Black ones.", "Each key produces a sound at a distinct frequency on pressing, and we press multiple keys simultaneously to play a chord. That\u2019s it!", "White Keys are named as C, D, E, F, G, A, B whereas Black Keys are named using two terms \u2014 Flat (b) and Sharp (#).", "If a black key is on the right side of any white key, it\u2019s called the sharp of that corresponding white key. And, if it is on the left side, it\u2019s called the flat of that corresponding white key.", "For example, the black key between C and D has two names: C# (C-Sharp) and Db (D-Flat). This is because it is on the right side of C and also on the left side of D.", "We\u2019ll use the \u201cSharp\u201d terminology in this article to avoid confusion. Also, the words, \u201cNotes\u201d and \u201cKeys\u201d are used interchangeably.", "Keeping that in mind, let\u2019s begin!", "You must have heard about the waves in your physics class. Waves like electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves, sound waves, etc \u2026 oscillate repeatedly about the equilibrium at some given frequency.", "Mathematically speaking, waves can be described by a wave equation like \u2014", "A = Amplitude or the Peak Value", "We can easily create a function in Python to generate a NumPy array of a wave with respect to time, as shown in the following code:", "You can also plot this array using some library (like matplotlib) to get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on.", "The frequency of 440Hz implies that the wave completes 440 full cycles in one second. In other words, it completes one cycle in 1/440th of a second.", "Since we divided our 1 second into 44100 parts, according to the sample_rate, we can plot our one cycle by printing elements from 0 to int(44100/440)", "Note: As you can see, the cycle is not fully completed in the graph. Ideally, this cycle completes at 100.227, but since we are using the discrete time interval (at 100) it is slightly off from it\u2019s initial value (i.e. 0).", "As mentioned earlier, a piano consists of multiple octaves. Although every octave is physically identical, it may sound a bit high-pitched or low-pitched with respect to the other.", "If we want to create a single octave (set of 12 keys), then we must know how each key is calibrated in relation to the other. After that, we can just double (or half) the frequency of all the keys, to get the next octave.", "Pianos are tuned using an \u201cequal temperament system\u201d. That means the relationship between the frequency of the keys (notes) is like this \u2014", "Where n is the number of notes away from the base note.", "For example, if we consider C as our base note, then C# will have the frequency = base_freq * 2^(1/12)", "We can easily build this logic with a single for loop in python (without using any special libraries).", "So now that we have our virtual piano ready, it\u2019s time to play something.", "The song that you heard at the beginning of this article is called \u201cAh! vous dirai-je, maman\u201d. This is a popular French children\u2019s song which is famously coupled with \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d, a nursery rhyme by Jane Taylor.", "Obviously, I played the simplest version possible \u2014 in a minimum number of steps as follows:", "Step-1: Get the notes of the song you want to play.", "Step-2: Make a function to concatenate all the notes.", "Step-3: Write the song into a file using Scipy and play.", "Clearly, there is much more to the \u201cMathematics of Music\u201d than I described here. Many questions have been left unanswered, like the theory of Consonance and Dissonance, playing Chords and Scales, tuning of a piano, etc\u2026", "Hopefully, I will cover them later.", "You can find the complete source code on my Github repo.", "\u201cMay not music be described as the mathematics of the sense, mathematics as music of the reason?
