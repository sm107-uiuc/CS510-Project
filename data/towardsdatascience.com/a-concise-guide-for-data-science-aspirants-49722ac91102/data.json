I am a Data Analyst working at a startup for a while, where I have worked with Data Scientists, Product Managers. I am here to share my opinions based on my experiences and be helpful in some way)", "TLDR: This article is meant for those who want to venture into this field, to give them an idea of what to / what not to expect from it, what to look out for when applying for a job in Data Science and what are different options available when you want to try out management roles while still being connected to \u2018Data\u2019.", "Let me start by briefly explaining what these buzzwords mean, which are often interchangeably used by people, to clear up the confusion.", "Data Analyst \u2014 The role of a Data Analyst largely includes (not limited to, can go beyond this, depending on the flexibility of the role at the company that you are working for) fetching and wrangling or munging data and then deriving insights from it, building dashboards to visualise them. Now, Business Analyst and Product Analyst are specialised roles of DA where one is working closely with the Business / product teams focused on specific works", "Data Scientist \u2014 takes one step forward and uses the insights derived for making decisions and taking actions, performing experiments with particular hypotheses, building frameworks/flows by connecting the dots, integrating different parts to arrive at the final solution", "ML Engineer [1] \u2014 While Data Science is about finding patterns in data, ML is about modeling those patterns in the data using a machine in order to solve specific problems, automating tasks that humans cannot manually do when large data sets are involved. The work mostly consists of feature engineering , building models, validating them, deploying them. There might not be many surprises here, unlike Data science.", "Data Engineer makes sure that the analysts and scientists have the data that they need readily available. Their work is :", "Strong foundation in Mathematics and Statistics is key to Data analysis and Science. As you move to ML engineering and Data engineering, you are expected to do a lot of coding and be well versed with the distributed systems and architecture . However, ML in academia / research involves more theory and mathematics. Everyone in these roles have to work in tandem to bring a goal to life. That said, the lines of work in these different roles are overlapping to some extent.", "There has been some talk going on about how different these are from the roles of software development and engineering. Now, that is a topic for another day", "[Note : These are purely based on my experiences and observations in Indian market]", "Every company wants to jump on this bandwagon of Data Science and start creating a huge impact on their businesses . But what you should know is that, not every company exactly knows how and why they wanna do it.", "1. Many times, I came across articles with the subject \u2014 \u2018there is a gap between supply and demand of talent in Data Science / ML\u2019 . I don\u2019t think that is true. But, also it is not that easy to get hired as a DS. Here is why. Every company is looking for something different [2] -", "2. You need to know if your goals align with what the company is doing , their vision. Find out whether or not DS/ML is considered as one of the driving forces in their business. If data is not worshipped there , then that\u2019s not where you would want to be. Hence , it is crucial to research about the company that you wish to join. Bring that inner Sherlock, from inside of you, to start digging for the info !", "3. Your role could be specific or a combination of different roles (mentioned above), depending on what stage the company is at. It is your job to find out about the scope of work. And, this scope can grow beyond bounds depending on the proactiveness and capability of the person. Especially, when the company is in rudimentary stages, you might be expected to wear different hats and do the work of different roles combined.", "4. It is essential that you know about the employees (their qualifications) working there in the same department , cause these are the very people who will be mentoring you, now and then, and you would want them to be experienced, well equipped with knowledge and skills, and guide you when stuck with something. Collaboration and sharing knowledge is core to development of one\u2019s skills while working a job.", "You should come out of the delusion that all you are gonna do is use those fancy algorithms that you have learnt and concoct a solution/ product which will be adopted by users across different teams in the company to create a meaningful impact. Well, step out of that fantasy, and see the reality for what it is \u2014 not very dreamy and simple, like you think. Ouch ! [3]", "However, you are expected to keep up with the latest developments in the domain to stay relevant.", "3. The journey leading up to a solution might not be as smooth as you imagine. You could be working on something for weeks only to find out that it is not gonna work out. Then, you have to rework your plans and reinvent the wheel. Since, there is a lot of exploration and experimentation involved, you can expect some uncertainty in the way, Patience is the key.", "4. Productionising (deploying and scaling if required) the solution is as equally important as arriving at it . It is significant that the ideas/ solutions are brought to fruition in the form of a product /tool which can be used by users whom it is meant for. Efforts have to be put in till the last mile.", "5. Understand that more emphasis is put on getting this right \u2014 which, why and when to use an algorithm (ML/ DL / or any) to solve your problem than writing the algorithm itself. Since tools are available out there, by big players like Microsoft, Amazon, Google (checkout H2O.ai to start with), which help you apply an algorithm on any dataset, there is no need to build it from scratch. They can do everything from feature engineering to deploying it. Although the increased use of AutoML takes some of the burden off of the shoulders of Data Scientists, I believe it can\u2019t completely replace them [4] .", "6. You are expected to have good communication skills as you would be -", "7. Having burnouts is not uncommon. You gotta figure out how to cope up and deal with them. Pulling yourself through in those times is a part of the process.", "If you want to explore the field of management within Data domain , then this role is for you \u2014 Data Product Manager", "Work of a quintessential Data PM looks like this :", "Now, a data product manager overseeing the development of data products which cater specifically to the users within the company is called a Data Platform Product Manager [5]", "You might as well innovate a new role for yourself !", "Here are some suggestions or tips that you can follow which helps in standing out from others who are chasing this Holy Grail", "Digital media is burgeoning and you need to put yourself out there showcasing your abilities in the domain that you want to pursue. So, publish articles , blogs about your projects . Put them on Github. Do whatever is needed to provide that visibility of your work to the recruiters.", "Cold emailing (or contacting on LinkedIn) relevant persons responsible for hiring you for that position. Keep these points in mind while drafting the email [6] :", "Few things that are overlooked by the candidates but are considered important by recruiters while interviewing a candidate for the job of Data scientist :", "Given that there are abundant applications where DS and ML can be used by leveraging data, and these are only increasing every day, one can find numerous opportunities to start their career in this field.", "For example , healthcare , banking-consulting-investing sectors, marketing, geo informatics. Heck, there is a dedicated data scientist for a football club with international stature!! [7] Use of NLP and Computer Vision are extensively gaining popularity and one needs to keep themselves updated about them and other developments from time to time. Go out there, create opportunities for yourselves , build stuff, invent things and enjoy the process whilst doing all that.", "Best of luck to all of you, who want to pursue their career in Data Science.
