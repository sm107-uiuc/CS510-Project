We often draw graphs as nodes combined by edges where nodes represent some real-life entities like users on Facebook and the edge represents the relationship between entities like being friends on Facebook. Read more about graphs in my previous article. We will be using the concept of bipartite graphs and the NetworkX package in this article.", "There are two conditions for defining a bipartite graph. Firstly, it is a graph in which the nodes are partitioned into two sets. Secondly, the nodes in one set cannot be connected to one another; they can only be connected to nodes in the other set. Let us take an example to make this more concrete.", "Consider the Amazon Shopping site. Customers purchase products using the Amazon website/app. Assume we are creating a graph for this model. Let us partition the nodes into two sets, the customer partition, and the product partition. Edges denote that the customer has purchased a particular product. In this case, it makes perfect sense that products cannot be connected to products because one product cannot purchase another product. Likewise for customers.", "Let us create a bipartite graph using the NetworkX package.", "If we inspect the nodes of the graph while passing in the data=True argument we will see the partition information stored.", "NetworkX does not provide an explicit bipartite graph class, we need to explicitly write the code for filtering out different node sets. This can be accomplished using List Comprehensions. Now, let us try and retrieve only the \u2018Customers\u2019 set from the above graph.", "Let us try and understand how we can apply bipartite graphs to the recommendation system problem.", "Bipartite graph is the underlying data structure used in the collaborative filtering method which is prominently used in many recommendation systems like Netflix and Amazon.", "On Github, users develop code with one another on repositories. As the article title suggests, we will recommend repositories for users to work on using the concept of highly similar nodes in one set. Let\u2019s say we have a bipartite graph as shown below.", "User1 is connected to repo2 and we want to recommend repositories that User1 might be interested in working on. Now we can try and analyze all the other users that are connected to repo2 other than User1. In this case, User2 and User3 are connected to repo2. Also, observe that User3 is also connected to one more repository repo1. Hence we may want to recommend repo1 to User1 to contribute. Most websites like Amazon, YouTube, and Netflix use collaborative filtering as a part of their recommender systems where suggestions are given to users based on likes and dislikes of similar users.", "We have an adjacency list of repositories and users. We have numbers instead of names for users and repositories. According to the NetworkX docs, the adjacency list format consists of lines with node labels. The first label in a line is the source node. Further labels in the line are considered target nodes and are added to the graph along with an edge between the source node and target node. Example \u2014", "a b c ( \u2018a\u2019 is the source node and \u2018b\u2019, \u2018c\u2019 are the target nodes)", "represents a graph having an edge between a-b and a-c.", "As you can see one user can be connected to many repositories and vice versa. Lines with single labels represent nodes having no edges. We can create a Graph from above file using the following command.", "We can notice there are 22,000 nodes (users + repositories) and 20,000 edges. Now let us split our nodes into 2 sets, the users set and the projects set.", "Now let us find the number of user nodes and the number of project nodes. We can accomplish this task by iterating over the list of nodes and checking the bipartite attribute and finding the length of list generated as we did for the customers and product nodes above.", "On executing the above code, 10721 user nodes were found and 11632 project nodes were found.", "Let us assume 2 people, A and B. A is connected to repo2, and B is connected to repo2 and repo3. How can we find the shared repository(repo2) of A and B?", "The intersection method will return the common elements among 2 or more sets. With the help of the above logic, we can find the similarity score of 2 users.", "Similarity Metric of 2 users = Number of projects shared / total number of projects.", "Using the above logic, for a given user A, we can find the most similar user by computing the similarity metric of A with all other users and extracting the user with maximum score.", "Example \u2014 Let us assume 2 people, A and B. A is connected to repo2, and B is connected to repo2 and repo3. How can we find the difference between repositories of A and B?", "B.difference(A) will return repo 3. The difference() method will return the nodes that are present in first set and not present in the second set.", "The dataset and full code is available on Github here.", "Which of the above is a bipartite graph? Try answering the node sets too! Looking forward to your responses. Do check the responses for the correct answer.", "In this article, we understood the concept of a bipartite graph and its usage in recommendation systems. We also created a Github repository recommender system using the NetworkX package. There are many more metrics and methods used in recommender systems which will be discussed in future articles.
