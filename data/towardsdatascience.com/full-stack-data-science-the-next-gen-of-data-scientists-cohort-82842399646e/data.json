However, there are a lot of myths that people presume about data science. It\u2019s no more just machine learning and statistics. Over the years, I have spoken to a lot of data science aspirants about breaking into this field. Why is there all the hype about data science? Is it still statistics and machine learning that can help you break into this field? Is it still going to be the future? Even I was in the same boat as you all, but I am now experiencing how the demand has molded currently for the next generation of data scientists breaking into this field. I am not going to teach you how to get into data science as many people on the internet are already doing it.", "Everyone around the corner wants to get into data science. A few years ago, there was a demand-supply problem in the field: supply of data scientists was less, and demand was more after Dr. DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher tossed the term Data Science. But now, in 2020, the situation has turned around. The inflow of formally/MOOCs educated data science enthusiasts has increased, and the demand has grown too, but not to that extent. The term has evolved broader and broader to incorporate most of the supporting functionalities that one needs to do data science. I would like to quote one of my favorite quotes from KD nuggets:", "\u201cData Science is like Teenage Sex: Everyone talks about it, No body really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it.\u201d", "Jokes apart, These are some of the things which I feel why data science has taken over all the hype:", "Someone is going to say it, so let me spill some truth about the current industry situation. Due to increase in demand and prestige of the shiny Data Scientist title, Many companies have started switching data scientist titles with product analyst, business intelligence analyst, business analyst, supply chain analyst, data analyst, and statistician because people were leaving their jobs to get the data scientist titles at companies which were giving them for doing the same job. It\u2019s all the matter of respect that many roles get due to this minor change in the words. So, companies have started twisting titles, in the same way, to make it more shiny and desirable like data scientist-analytics, product data scientist, data scientist-growth, data scientist-supply chain, data scientist-visualization, or data scientist - what not?.", "Most people pursuing education/online training have a misconception that all data scientists build fancy machine learning models, but that\u2019s not always true. At least that was the case with me when I started pursuing my masters in applied data science, I assumed that most data scientists do machine learning but when I entered the internship and job market in the US, that\u2019s when I came to know about the real truth. The force driving people towards pursuing data science is due to the hype around artificial intelligence and its business impact.", "For people who want to do applied machine learning as a Data Scientist-ML(That\u2019s how I am going to name the title because it\u2019s not data scientist-analytics :p)in 2020 without a Ph.D., there\u2019s a lot more to it now instead of just knowing to apply machine learning to datasets which almost anyone today can do. There are a few other crucial things which I figured out from my experience, which can help you nail the data scientist role hunting for the interview process or even to get shortlisted:", "So, This is the time when knowing only Machine Learning or Statistics is not gonna get you into data science to do ML unless you are lucky, have some great connections in the industry(you should obviously do networking which is very important!) or have an exceptional research record already in your name. Business applications and domain knowledge tends to come with experience and can\u2019t be learned beforehand other than doing internships in relevant industries.", "Two months back, I joined the media power-house ViacomCBS as a Data Scientist straight out of grad school without any prior full-time industry experience except research assistantships and internships. My responsibilities here include building ML Products from ideation\u200a\u2014\u200adevelopment\u200a\u2014\u200aproduction where I use most of the things listed above. I hope this will be helpful for all the aspiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers who are trying to break into this field.", "Shoot your questions on [myLastName][myFirstName] at gmail dot com or let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
