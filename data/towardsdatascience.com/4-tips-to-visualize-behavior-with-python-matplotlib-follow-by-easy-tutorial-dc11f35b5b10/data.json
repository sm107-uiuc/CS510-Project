Unbounce is a subscription-based tool that helps marketers build and optimize landing pages for a high conversion rate. Like any other subscription-based companies, we want to reduce churn and attract customers to stay longer. A big part of it is to understand which behaviors correlate to longer customer retention, why so, and how we can nurture those behaviors.", "Although there are many statistical methods we can use to check customer behavior trends, I find it helpful to visualize the behavior of some customers (and discuss with customer-facing teams) to form hypotheses that can be validated later on.", "For this tutorial, we will use sample data that includes events and subscription information for 4 accounts. No personal information is included, and account unique identifications have been changed to ensure security.", "Customer behavior data usually includes date and time events, the moments when customers do a particular action. In this tutorial, we will look into events for account republish (republished_df) and login (login_df).", "We also have subscription information for each customer (subscription_info_df). A customer can have multiple subscriptions, but each subscription is mutually exclusive. A new subscription for a customer only starts when he/she churns (meaning stop paying) then re-subscribe. We call this person a flapper.", "Before going into the visualization, we need to transform date columns to date-time format. Right now, Python thinks that they are a bunch of strings. Hence, the dates will not be arranged in a timely order.", "Let\u2019s get sample data for an account for this tutorial.", "This tip is handy when we need to visualize different events that only happen once, but they may happen on the same day.", "Like any subscription-based company, Unbounce expects flappers \u2014 subscribers who subscribe, churn, then come back at some point in time. There are cases when churn and re-subscription happen on the same date. To distinguish same-day flappers, we can use this color mixing trick.", "Note: we assume here that each subscription is mutually exclusive to another.", "If we visualize subscription start date with a different color than subscription end date and use some opacity level, we will have a different color for same-day flappers.", "For example, here I choose blue for subscription start date and red for subscription end date, and change opacity level through alpha = 0.5 (alpha ranges from 0 to 1). This results in magenta for same-day flappers.", "You can learn more about the basics of color mixing through this article.", "Here is a list of color codes in Matplotlib.", "From the chart above, we know that this account is a flapper with 4 subscriptions. On the last subscription, he/she is a same-day flapper. The last subscription started when the 3rd one ended, and thus we see magenta instead of blue or red here.", "Besides colors and alpha, there are more parameters in axes.plot() function that you can play around depending on how you want to design your chart, such as type of marker and marker size (we will go into more details for marker in the next tip).", "Read more about these parameters here.", "This tip is handy when we need to visualize different events that can happen multiple times on the same day.", "Because Unbounce is a tool that helps marketers to publish and optimize their landing pages, we care about republish events. We want to understand:", "To help answer these questions, we need to plot login and republish on the same chart. There are 2 problems with this:", "And to solve these problems, we can use different shapes (through marker) and opacity levels (through alpha) in axes.plot() function. There are many marker types, but here I use circles for logins and triangles for republishes. You can find out other types here: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/markers_api.html#module-matplotlib.markers.", "From the chart above, we can answer the two behavior questions:", "This tip is especially handy when you want to compare one entity to another.", "If we only look into one customer, we don\u2019t know whether this customer is a highly-engaged one, or whether this behavior is a norm for all of our customer base. To figure this out, we can start with the simplest technique: pick some customers randomly, and manually compare their behavior.", "To make a more reasonable comparison, we want to make sure charts use the same scale. There can be customers who start their subscriptions early in the year, while some others start mid-year or end of the year. In this case, I want to limit my chart to show a date range from January 1st to December 31st. We can use axes.set_xlim() function for this.", "I\u2019m a big fan of the rule of three inspired by David Robinson.", "When you\u2019ve written the same code 3 times, write a function", "Since we\u2019re going to visualize the behavior of 4 customers in the dataset (obviously this is more than 3), I want to write a function. I love functions because we can make systematic changes to visualizations and save so much time copy-pasting those changes to each chart.", "Our first function is to get the data for an account.", "Our second function is to visualize the account\u2019s behavior. Note that I use the first function within the second function.", "Here is the full code for everything we had just run through in this tutorial:", "For more articles on data analytics and work-life balance, you can check out my blog.
