So when looking for a company to work for, you may be able to afford to be a bit picky. Even if you are looking for your first data science gig, I would caution you not to blindly jump at the first offer you receive. It is so important to do your homework and make sure that the company is a good fit for you.", "Obviously there are lots of different types of companies that might hire a data scientist, but for this story, I will focus on startup companies. I will detail the signs that I use to help identify if a startup is a healthy work environment. I hope that some of these ideas will help you to make the right decisions for you when you are next looking for a job in a startup company.", "For me, this goes without saying.", "In the tips I provide below I am assuming that the startup you are considering has already proven to you that the work you would do there is something you are interested in. I am also assuming that the work will challenge you to grow in your career.", "Because let\u2019s face it, if you don\u2019t have interesting and challenging data problems to work on then all the rest is a bit of a wash for a data scientist.", "Money is an obvious factor that many people use to determine which job they will take. However, money is not everything and your compensation package is not what is going to make you happy in the long run. Once you have enough money to live the lifestyle that you choose, more money is not going to have a huge impact on your life.", "That is not to say that you should accept a less than competitive salary. You want to feel valued by the company you work for!", "Perks are nice to have, but do not make or break the deal for me.", "Lots of startup companies offer perks to their employees to attract and keep the best talent. These can be anything from free lunches to neck massages. Lots are useful, like transportation stipends. Others seem more frivolous, but can still be fun.", "Yet, I would advise you to look a little deeper when you decide where you want to spend your time. It can be exciting to think about working somewhere with such great perks, but make sure that working there is also going to make you happy.", "The following list is the things that I look for in a prospective startup company. It is based on what I value and what I know makes me happy. You may have different values to me, but hopefully these ideas will help you to discern if a startup company matches what you value.", "Transparency can mean a lot of different things to different people. For me, it means the leadership team encourages open and honest conversations. Particularly, that they are supportive of employees asking questions about the company\u2019s direction, funding and wages.", "I really hate the feeling that someone is trying to pull the wool over my eyes. That is why transparency is so important to me. If the expectation is for employees to be like lemmings and follow along blindly, then I know that startup is not the right company for me.", "The CEO and company leadership can really set the tone for how much information is shared at a startup.", "When I worked at one startup, they would have regular leadership retreats. During these retreats the direction of the company for the next quarter would be decided. On the Monday morning immediately following the retreat a whole company meeting would be scheduled. That way the decisions could be communicated directly with every member of the team. It was empowering to be able to ask questions and provide feedback to the leadership team on the direction of the startup.", "Often the leadership retreat would occur just prior to a product pivot. I liked the way that the company would provide the reasons that they came to their decisions so that we could understand their thinking.", "Another example of effective transparency was at a company where the CEO would give regular seminars on how startup funding and stock options work. One such seminar that I found particularly informative was discussing the latest round of funding and the implications for employee stock options. I found it fascinating to learn how raising money would dilute each type of stock.", "It made me much more confident that the CEO had the best interests of the company and the employees at heart because he took the time to explain these concepts to us. In addition, he talked about the reasons startups take on different rounds of funding. It really opened my eyes to how startup companies in San Francisco work.", "Another level of transparency is being open about all employee wages. I have never actually experienced this one, but in theory I think it is a good idea in theory.", "There are startup companies where they have a list of job titles and what each of those job titles get paid. That way there is complete transparency and they can avoid a lot of the issues with wage inequity.", "The only issue can be if those published wages are not competitive enough to attract top data scientists. But on the bright side, if you do decide on a startup with open salary practices, then you don\u2019t have to worry about negotiating your wage.", "Some startups will let their employees work at times that suit them. By letting team members set their own working hours, people can work the way that maximises their efficiency.", "Early birds can start with the sun but get home in time to pick their kids up from school. Whilst night owls can sleep in and come to work late and keep going into the night.", "Different people naturally work better at different times of the day. Personally I always feel like I do my best work before midday. Similarly, different people have varied home lives which may put diverse pressures on their time.", "Obviously the would still need to meet all the commitments around being an employee, like attending meetings. Yet, by allowing flexibility, startup companies may be able to get better quality and quantity of work out of their team. I have talked a little more about flexible work schedule in my previous story about a day in the life of a data scientist at a San Francisco startup.", "Another huge advantage of startups that have a flexible work day is that many employees can negotiate to work from home, some or all of the time. In my opinion, there are some discussions that are best had in person, but I have always enjoyed working for companies that allow work from home days at least part of the time.", "Furthermore, having the flexibility to let staff work from home means that if people are feeling sick they can stay away. If people only have the sniffles, normally they might feel inclined to soldier on and go to work anyway. Yet, if they have the option of working from home, then if they are not unwell enough to need a sick day, they can still stay home. That way they will not spread their illness through the whole company.", "I have heard lots of terrible stories about startups that use people up and then spit them back out again. So far that has not been my experience, but I know that it does happen.", "To try to avoid companies that have this practice, I look for startups that encourage their employees to have good work life balance.", "This can be difficult to discern by looking at a company on the surface. The leadership may say that they encourage their employees to have good balance in their lives, but that may not be the case in practice.", "For example, many startup companies have unlimited sick and holiday leave policies. At first glance, that seems like a great indicator that work life balance is encouraged. However, many places with unlimited leave policies make their employees feel guilty if they ever do take a holiday. If the employees never actually take the leave, then, in fact, they don\u2019t have a good balance in their lives.", "One way to potentially figure out if a startup has good practices in encouraging work life balance is to talk to some of the employees. Preferably go for a walk away from the office and talk one-on-one with some of your prospective teammates. Hopefully, they would feel comfortable enough to tell you the truth. Alternatively, you could ask around what some of the fun trips people have taken to try to see if people are encouraged to take time off and travel.", "A great CEO is so important to the success of any startup company. But how do you spot one?", "Something that I think is a great indicator of an excellent CEO is if they have had employees follow them from their previous startup. That shows that in their previous endeavours, they generated enough trust and goodwill in the people around them that those same individuals were willing to work for them again. It also shows that they are an experienced CEO.", "An example of this, was when I worked for a startup company where the CEO had successfully sold his previous company. I knew that he must have done the right thing by his employees since some of them followed him. They had shared in the upside of the sale of his previous company.", "What a vote of confidence in his abilities. People had chosen to work for him again, even though the company was focused on solving a completely different technology problem.", "I think that you can tell if a startup has a culture of sharing credit where credit is due by asking a few key questions in an interview. If you are interested in a few of their data science projects you could ask different members of the data science team who was responsible for that work. You may be able to tell from their answers if the startup has a culture of being generous with credit or not.", "Everyone wants to feel like they are doing a good job, but in my experience it is only people who are already feeling appreciated, who are willing to share around kudos for a job well done.", "For me, there was a stark contrast between some of the places I have worked and the way that credit was shared.", "In one place, people did not feel secure in their positions and so would feel the need to advocate for themselves and make sure that they were given praise for the work that they had done. Conversely, at another company in meetings people were always quick to give props to their colleagues for any contributions they had made to collaborative work.", "The latter was a much nicer place to work because if you made a mistake, colleagues were all too happy to help you out rather than throw you under the bus. I personally believe that was related to the fact that the companies leadership team and also individual department heads gave team members lots of recognition for their great work.", "I think it is extremely important for all members of a startup team to feel like they are empowered.", "Empowerment can be provided in many ways, but one that I think is particularly important is by encouraging input.", "If employees can voice any ideas that they have for the product they are likely to feel empowered. Even better if the company has an established way for employees to submit ideas. That way they can be considered by the company leadership team.", "One of the places that I have worked had a special email address set up so that anyone in the company could email the product team with an idea. They would then triage the ideas into the ticketing system to be considered at regular product meetings devoted to that purpose. This made everyone at that company feel empowered to influence the direction of product development if they had a good idea.", "Another way that empowerment is important in a startup is in management style. There is nothing I hate more than a micromanager.", "So when interviewing for a job, I always ask the head of the data science team what sort of management style they have? Other team members can also provide insights into how your prospective boss manages their direct reports.", "That way you know if you join the company if you will be trusted to be left alone to get on with your work, or if you will have your supervisor hovering over your shoulder the whole time.", "Good company policies may mean different things to you than it does to me. Yet, some of the things that I look for are an equal opportunities policy, a good maternity leave policy, good sick leave policy and adequate holiday leave policies.", "One of the startups that I have previously worked for did not have a maternity leave policy when one of the marketing team became pregnant. She needed to implement one to be able to use it when she had her baby. I think it would have been much better for them to have thought about a maternity leave policy before that.", "Although, it was nice to have a hand in shaping the policy that applied directly to her. She was able to modify it to include additional elements she thought were important. However, she did tell me that it was a little stressful trying to get the new policy implemented in time.", "Some workplaces require you to get a sick certificate if you want to take a day off of work. It is like you have to prove that you are in fact ill. To me, that is indicative of a lack of trust. Instead, I think it is much better to incentivise employees to take time off when they need it so that they can recover more quickly from illnesses when they occur.", "One startup, where I was a data scientist, had a medical director who set a very specific sick policy. Part of that policy was that employees were not allowed to come to work if they needed a box of tissues at their desk. This company really wanted to encourage employees to stay home if they were sick so that the whole company did not come down with it. The team was small so if the flu made its way through the office, the product development would have come to a grinding halt.", "It was so nice to have that flexibility to stay home and work if I was not sure if I was sick or not. If I thought I was coming down with something, I would often rest for the first half of the day and then work in the afternoon. We did not have to specify if it was a sick day or not, just tell our manager that we were feeling a bit under the weather. Then we could do as much or as little work as we felt was appropriate. All from the comfort of our PJs at home.", "I like to work for startups that are willing to invest in the education and career development of their employees. It is one more way that the leadership of a startup can make their team feel valued. Furthermore, it is in the best interest of the company to up-skill and retain their valuable talent.", "For many startup companies, wages is one of the most expensive aspects of the business. So it is good for everyone if they invest in the skill development of those individuals. If people can develop their careers at the same startup company, they are more likely to stay. Thus retaining all of that company knowledge they have picked up.", "Many data science teams have an allowance for time and money to attend conferences, go to workshops or continue to study topics relevant to their work. That way employees are less likely to feel bored or unfulfilled in their position if they know there is potential for growth. This is something that you can easily ask about in an interview.", "This may seem trivial and boring, but ergonomics are important. In the long term, your body will thank you, if you choose to work at a company that takes ergonomics seriously.", "If you are planning to spend the majority of your career as a data scientist, you will be spending a lot of your time at a desk working on a computer. Therefore, if you want to have longevity in your career, you need to take care of yourself. If you ignore good ergonomics, it is likely that you will eventually develop repetitive strain injury (RSI), neck and possibly back pain.", "However, if you are careful and follow ergonomic best practices you may be able to avoid these issues. Many startups will let you choose what sort of desk setup you would like. This may include what type of computer you use, but also external screens, mouse and keyboard.", "Before I joined my first startup, they asked me what equipment I would like them to supply for me to use? I had no idea at the time, but the CTO suggested that I have a think about it and get back to him. Luckily I consulted a friend who is an occupational therapist and got some great advice on what to look for. Because of that advice, I got the best keyboard and mouse for my situation. As such, I have so far been able to avoid many of the issues I mentioned above.", "Many startups now provide sit-stand desks for their offices. They can be electronic or have a crank system so that you can raise or lower your desk throughout the day. I was advised that it is good practice to try to stand for 5\u201310 minutes every hour.", "I didn\u2019t necessarily achieve this every day, for every hour. But at least I knew what to aim for. Even if I didn\u2019t manage to stand as often as I should have, I would always make sure to take breaks and go for a walk around the office. Making a cup of tea was part of my ritual to keep myself moving and not get stuck in the same position. It was so nice to know that the startup I was working for really cared about their employees and their health.", "You know what they say about all work and no play.", "A sense of whimsy at work can do a lot to lighten the mood at work. Many startup companies have their own varied fun traditions. I think that the main thing to look for is that these traditions are inclusive and do not alienate any individuals.", "For example, some startups have happy hour poker nights. That is all well and good if all the employees that want to stay for happy hour enjoy playing poker. However, that might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.", "This was the case at one startup company where I worked. Their solution was to purchase a wide range of board games so that everyone felt more like they could join in.", "Similarly, at the same company, we would often go out after work for drinks. A few people did not like alcohol and did not enjoy drinking culture. To make sure that these people also felt like they could join in, the office manager would plan the happy hour at outside venues where there were other options that the non-drinkers would enjoy too.", "For example, we would often go to the Ferry Building on Embarcadero in San Francisco where there was a great place to have beers. Right next door was one of the best ice cream parlours in the city. That way everyone could get something that they wanted and feel included.", "Another fun tradition that we had is that whenever a team member went on holidays, they were encouraged to bring back the ugliest mug they could find. It was a great way for the company to show that they wanted people to make use of their unlimited leave policy. Additionally, anyone could get involved and have a bit of fun with it.", "Some of the mugs in our collection were not even functional \ud83d\ude1c That got bonus points!", "Other great traditions I have experienced at startups are company off-sites. These team building activities may seem kitsch but I think that they always had the desired effect of bringing the team closer together and encouraging communication.", "I hope you have found these tips on how to spot a great startup company with a healthy culture useful. Toxic culture does exist at some startups and these ideas might help you to avoid them in your data science career. If you are working somewhere that you do not feel valued, appreciated and trusted, I would encourage you to use these tips to start looking elsewhere. Everyone deserves to feel empowered and welcome at work.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
