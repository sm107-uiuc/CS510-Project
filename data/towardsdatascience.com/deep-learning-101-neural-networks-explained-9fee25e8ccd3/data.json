The poster-boys for these cutting edge AI solutions \u2014 Deep Learning and Neural Networks, despite their hype, are understood only by a few.", "In this article, I will try to explain what Neural Networks are, and how they function, and their strengths and limitations. And hopefully, convince you that they\u2019re much simpler than they\u2019re thought to be.", "NOTE: Deep Learning is an subset of Machine Learning, and if you\u2019re unsure how that works, I\u2019d advise you check out this article first.", "Before diving right in, let\u2019s explore a simpler problem, to establish a few fundamental concepts.", "Assume we\u2019re a credit card company targeting people without an adequate credit history. Using the historical data of its users, we want to decide whether a new applicant should be given the credit card or not.", "Assume the data we have to make the decision is the following.", "Note: I realize that the latter 4 are \u201cqualitative\u201d variables, but for this illustration, let\u2019s assume we can somehow quantify them", "The final decision is a Yes or No, thus making it a classification problem. To solve this we\u2019ll make a small modification to our linear regression approach \u2014 After multiplying the variables with their weights (the technically correct name of the slopes or coefficients we used in Linear Regression) and adding them, (and the constant), the result can be any number, and to convert it into a Yes/No decision, we will have to process it further, i.e. pass it through a function.", "One option for g could be a simple Threshold function:", "Ie. The decision being No if the sum product of variables and weights is z<0 and Yes if Z>=0", "However often, instead of absolute Yes or No, we may want the probability of the result, and also because the algorithm computing the optimum weights work better for smooth (or in technical terms, differentiable) functions, we use a different function called the sigmoid.", "Tying it all together, for a new customer, we can input the different variables (age, salary etc.), sum their product with them with the weights, and apply the sigmoid function to get the probability of his eligibility for the card, and this whole process is called Logistic Regression.", "The reason for taking the detour through Logistic Regression was to introduce the concept of activation functions. The threshold or sigmoid function used in Logistic Regression were examples of activation functions. Any function applied on the sum-product of variables and weights(note that there will be a corresponding weight for each variable) is known as an activation function. Apart from the Threshold and sigmoid functions discussed above, a few others that are commonly used", "This means returning Z as it is if it\u2019s positive, and returning 0 otherwise.", "This is sigmoid stretched downwards on the y-axis so that it\u2019s centred at (0,0) instead of (0,0.5)", "These, along with their small variations are the most commonly used activation functions in Neural Networks because of reasons beyond the scope of this article.", "Generalizing the Logistic Regression Unit discussed above for a variable number of inputs, we get:", "Ie. Each unit (also called a neuron), takes in several inputs and outputs one number.", "Note:For the Logistic Regression example, the activation was the sigmoid function, and the output is the predicted probability.  In case of Linear Regression, there is no activation function (also called a linear activation function, ie. g(z) = z), and the output is our predicted number.", "Going back to our previous example of checking an applicant\u2019s eligibility for the credit card. For our classification task, instead of the Logistic Regression model, we can create a neural network to get better results.", "For creating a Neural Network, the first step is just stacking several units or neurons together to create a layer.", "Note that each blue circle is a processing unit (neuron), which performs the sum-product of the inputs (age, salary, education etc) and the weights, and applies an activation function (say ReLU) to give an output. Each neuron has a different set of weights and returns a different output.", "Now, just like for this layer, our inputs were the data\u2019s variables (age, salary, education etc), we can have this layer\u2019s outputs (O1, O2, O3, O4) flowing into the next layer as its inputs.", "We can keep adding layers like this. To complete the Neural Network, we add an output neuron which takes in the outputs from the last layer as its input and returns the final output (the Yes/No decision for our use-case).", "Congrats! Our Neural Network is ready!", "For any applicant, the data about their Input Variables will go to each of the 4 neurons in the first layer. Each Neuron will output one number and these set of 4 numbers will be the input for the second layer, whose 2 outputs will be sent to the final output neuron which then functions just like logistic regression, and returns our predicted probability of the applicant\u2019s eligibility.", "Each blue or green circle above is a neuron having their weights. These weights have to be \u201clearned\u201d by the model, just line in Linear Regression, where the model learned what slopes gave the results closest to the training data. This happens through processes called Back-propagation and Gradient Descent, which is beyond the scope of this article.", "But once, we have \u201ctrained\u201d the model, ie learned the optimum weights for all neurons, the input data is sent into the Neural Network, each neuron multiplying its inputs and weights, applying the activation on the sum and sending it to the next layer until we have the final result.", "Note: Usually, ReLU (or one of its variant) is used as an activation in the intermediate layers, and for the output layer, the activation is determined by the task at hand \u2014 Linear (or no activation) for Regression tasks and Sigmoid for classification.", "The blue layers (layers between the input and the final output neuron) are called the hidden layers. These are what makes the Model \u201cDeep\u201d. Without these, our model will be a simple Linear or Logistic Regression.", "So what was the benefit of this whole exercise of adding hidden layers, what does their output signify.", "The hidden layer neurons try to capture the latent patterns within the data that will help the model in predicting the creditworthiness of the individual.", "For example, one of the neurons could be inferring if he\u2019s earning enough to cover the average living expense of his city. Another neuron could be focusing on, say, the company and designation to get an idea of their job security, and another on, say, Age, Education, and Designation to get an idea about their performance on the job. One of them could even be focusing on the candidate\u2019s age and educational qualification to infer if he\u2019s likely to go for further studies if that turns out to be a relevant factor for the credit card company to decide his/her eligibility.", "These inferences help the NN to make a better decision about the applicant\u2019s eligibility. Insights like the candidate\u2019s salary adequacy, job security, performance, etc. will be better indicators to judge his/her eligibility than directly using the input variables(Age, Salary, Education etc).", "Note: A neuron focusing on a certain variable just means that it\u2019ll have higher magnitude (positive or negative) weights for that variable. The neurons will automatically adjust their weights using gradient descent algorithms to give outputs closest to the data on which they\u2019re trained.", "The mentioned inferences are just examples of what the neurons may be figuring out. In reality, inspecting the neural network (checking the neurons\u2019 weights), we may find patterns that may not be aligned to our general domain understanding or be directly interpretable by humans but have been identified by the NN as relevant for making predictions about the given data. Hence Neural Networks are also referred to as Black Box Models. Because even though the model will predict with high accuracy, the results are not usually interpretable, ie its users or even its developers are often not able to explain why they are getting the results that they are getting.", "Deep Learning Models for processing images (Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs) can be explained to an extent.", "For example, in the above representations (source) of a CNN used for facial identification, we can see that in the first layer, the model is identifying lines and curves at different angles. In the second layer, these lines and curves are combined to identify different sections of the face like eyes, nose, lips etc. The third layer uses these sections to identify the different types of faces. The final result of identifying a face will be made from a weighted sum of these different types of faces.", "Note: The number of layers, and number of neurons in each layer, are called the Hyperparameters, and are something whose desired value is found by the data scientist through trial and error. Unlike weights, (aka parameters), whose optimum value is found by calculus or other mathematical methods.", "The NN described above is one architecture, which is suitable for structured (or tabular) data. For unstructured data, we have different architectures \u2014 Convolutional NNs for Image Data, and Recurrent NNs for textual, sound or other sequential data. The layers are structured somewhat differently in these architectures, to yield better results for their use-case.", "Hopefully, this gave you a basic understanding of what Neural Networks (NNs), and Deep Learning is, and that it isn\u2019t as complicated as it seems. :)", "Your home for data science.
