Coming from a pharmacy background, I was interested in prescriptions. Specifically, if I could find a correlation between opioid prescribing and overdose deaths.", "The opioid epidemic is a nationwide problem involving both prescription painkillers and illegal opioids, both of which can lead to potentially fatal overdoses.", "It began in the late 1990s when pharmaceutical companies began promoting prescription painkillers with promises of pain relief without addiction.", "Doctors began prescribing them more frequently and opioid sales skyrocketed.", "Thousands of individuals began abusing the pain relievers, many of whom became addicted or overdosed.", "Oxycontin debuted in 1996, and was heavily marketed by its maker, Purdue Pharma, for providing 12 hour pain relief.", "However, even before hitting the market, clinical trials showed patients were only getting about 8 hours of pain relief. As the effects wear off, patients experience withdrawal symptoms \u2014 including intense drug cravings \u2014 which promotes addiction and dependence.", "As stated in this LA Times Article over 7 million Americans have abused OxyContin \u2014 the drug that is often blamed with kickstarting the opioid epidemic.", "Opioids are a class of highly addictive narcotic substances, both legal and illegal that are derived from the opium poppy plant. They can be prescription painkillers (Percocet, MS Contin, Duragesic) or street drugs (Heroin).", "All opioids stimulate the opioid receptors in the brain. While they vary in how powerful they are, all depress the central nervous system (slowing down body functions \u2014 including breathing) and reduce both physical and psychological pain.", "Opioids have many beneficial effects, most notably being pain relief. They can also cause feelings of relaxation and well-being, drowsiness, and can suppress coughing.", "Unfortunately, they also have many adverse effects. Some of the most common negative effects include constipation, nausea and vomiting, lethargy, and mood swings.", "Opioid use can also lead to addiction, and in cases of overdose, respiratory failure and death.", "Data was sourced from several publicly available sources.", "CDC WONDER is an online system that \u201cmakes the information resource of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) available to the public. . . With CDC WONDER you can search for and read published documents on public health concerns . . . and query numeric data sets on CDC\u2019s information systems.\u201d In this case we are interested in the mortality data.", "Deaths are classified using ICD-10 codes. Drug-poisoning deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes:", "Drug Poisoning Deaths are further classified by ICD-10 Category Codes:", "Because the data is from five different sources, significant cleaning was required. I began by filtering drug data on Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED). MED is used by clinicians to compare the relative strengths of different opioids. Using the HEDIS drug data, I dropped all rows where MED was null, as non-opioid drugs will not have a MED. Next I used the opioid only drug data to filter out rows of interest in the Medicare and Medicaid datasets.", "To combine the datasets, I merged all data on state, the common element.", "Lastly, I engineered new features including units per prescription, days supply per beneficiary, and means and medians.", "First we see opioids prescribed by specialty. Something interesting here is that general practitioners in family practice and internal medicine prescribed the greatest number of opioids.", "While this could be due to a greater number prescribers in family practice than in a specialty like pain management, it would be something interesting to investigate further.", "Here we can see the opioids most commonly prescribed for Medicare Part D patients. Vicodin was clearly the most popular.", "Below is a choropleth showing the average number of opioid units per prescription for each state. Many states had an average opioid prescription with over 70 units.", "Recently states have been imposing limits on initial opioid prescriptions. More information can be found in this Pharmacy Times article. It would be interesting to see if these new prescribing limits would lead to less units being prescribed per prescription.", "Here we can see how opioid deaths per year have increased between 1999 and 2016. It\u2019s interesting to note that Methadone related deaths decreased while all other types of opioid related deaths increased. And beginning in about 2013 synthetic narcotics (a group which includes Fentanyl) related deaths began to skyrocket.", "It would be interesting to expand the analysis here by looking at:", "The drug data has significant limitations. Most notably being that the data does not represent all opioid drugs prescribed in the United States.", "Medicare and Medicaid data only represent a portion of prescriptions and may not be representative of a physician\u2019s entire practice. Notably missing populations are commercially insured and self-pay patients.", "While the Medicare data is more detailed, containing individual prescribers and zip codes, the medicaid data is aggregated at the state level.", "Much of the death data obtained through CDC Wonder is suppressed. I was unable to find death data with demographics and location for the individual descendants, and was only able to use data aggregated by state.", "To protect the decedent\u2019s privacy and to prevent researchers from learning individual identities, death data was suppressed in all instances where there were less than 11 decedents per category.", "Also, the ICD-10 Category codes are not mutually exclusive. Each death can be coded with up to 20 cause of death codes. Therefore, we cannot know how much of a role other factors may have played in the deaths.", "This analysis is just barely scratching the surface and there are many more interesting relationships to be explored.", "I would like to continue my analysis and to apply supervised learning techniques to see if there is any correlation between opioid prescribing and overdose deaths.", "This project was done as part of my supervised learning capstone for Thinkful. Source code can be found on my github.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I\u2019m passionate about all things data!
