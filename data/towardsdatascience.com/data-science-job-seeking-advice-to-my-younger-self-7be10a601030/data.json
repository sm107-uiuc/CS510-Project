Several readers reached out personally to say that they had struggled with the same issues or were worried about the same decisions. During those conversations, I realized that my advice focused more on how to decide what kind of job you wanted but not how to actually find and get that job. Every career decision I\u2019ve made, except for my first job out of school, involved the decision to leave the position I was in at the time and search for something better. I haven\u2019t always gone about my job search in the most effective way, and each job search has taken quite a toll on my emotional health.", "So this post is about what I would have done differently.", "This lesson took me longer to learn than any others, and it stems from the fact that HR practices in the data science industry (among others) are really very broken. Much of a successful job search depends not only on how urgently you need a new job, but also on how much mental and emotional stamina you have. The internet application process generates a whole lot of smoke and not much heat: you\u2019ll send out 100 applications and, if you\u2019re lucky, you hear back from maybe 20 of them, get an initial phone screen for maybe 10, get to the next round for maybe 4, and get to final interview for 1 or 2. That amount of rejection \u2014 especially the passive rejection of simply not hearing back from most opportunities \u2014 can be exhausting. In most of my job searches, that exhaustion actually made me perform worse in those relatively rare cases where I did get an interview.", "It took me too long to realize that a lot of that rejection was unnecessary, because I could be the first one to call it quits. I was once recruited by a search agency looking to fill a new data science instruction position in a prominent hedge fund. I worked through several pre-screen interviews and coding challenges before being brought in to a full day of interviews. Most of those interviews were stimulating and cordial. But then I was brought into into interview with the company\u2019s head of data science. He was incredibly rude. I got the impression that he alone among the hiring committee hadn\u2019t wanted to bring me in. He asked a bunch of nonsense brain-teaser-type questions, repeatedly disparaged my experience, and ended the interview by simply dismissing me, refusing even to shake my hand. It was really ridiculous.", "I should have called the recruiter and told her I wasn\u2019t interested anymore. That\u2019s what I would have done if I was a hiring official and a candidate had acted that way. But I really wanted a job. So I raised my concerns about that interaction, got a second interview with the guy\u2019s boss who basically told me I shouldn\u2019t be so thin-skinned, and eventually they informed me that they would pass on my candidacy. Between the time I had the red-flag interview an the time they cut me loose, I wasted a lot of time and, more important, I wasted a lot of energy.", "That wasn\u2019t the only time that sort of thing happened to me. While that executive\u2019s behavior was particularly egregious, most opportunities that got to the interview stage raised some sort of major concern: I was given repeated ambiguous coding challenges without any explanation, even after asking, of what they were trying to assess; my references were treated unprofessionally by having calls scheduled then cancelled at the last minute; I would make it clear that something was an important part of what I was looking for in a job and then in the next interaction the hiring officials made clear that they either hadn\u2019t listened or hadn\u2019t remembered or hadn\u2019t cared. As the people offering the job, they certainly had the right to do all those things. I had the right to step away. I didn\u2019t exercise that right often enough.", "Related to my previous point: just because a job was available didn\u2019t mean I had to apply for it. The more applications I turned in, the more generic my applications became, and the more tired I became from turning out just slightly-altered cover letters and answering canned questions through an application portal. I\u2019ve come to settle on a particular process for finding high-quality opportunities:", "First, I look online and find jobs that are relatively fresh (posted in the last two weeks) and look interesting. I don\u2019t apply to any at this point. Rather, I look on LinkedIn and find if there is anyone in my network that can recommend me to anyone at all at the companies offering those jobs. I don\u2019t just find companies I have connections to \u2014 I contact those connections, tell them I\u2019m thinking about applying to the company, and ask them to introduce me to their contact (who isn\u2019t necessarily the hiring official) and explain specifically what job I am thinking of applying for, so the contact knows that I wan to talk to them specifically in order to decide whether to apply for the job. Incidentally, this is why I don\u2019t accept most connection requests I receive on LinkedIn \u2014 I keep my network only to those people who know me well enough that I can recommend them or they can recommend me.", "Next, I talk to the contact and listen for information that could get me noticed if I applied for the job: at worst, they\u2019ll mention a project the team is working on and I can make that project the basis of my eventual cover letter; at best, they know the hiring manager for the position and I can ask them to connect me. I don\u2019t try to campaign for the job during this stage. I just want information or an additional introduction. I do this until I either reach the hiring manager, determine I can\u2019t reach the hiring manager, or decide I\u2019m no longer interested. If still interested and I haven\u2019t reached the hiring manager, I fill out the online application and write a cover letter that references my past conversation(s) and explains why those conversations made me decide to apply. That makes it relatively easy to write a custom letter for every single job.", "If I haven\u2019t already spoken to the hiring manager by this time but I can figure out who they are, I send them an email and tell them I\u2019ve applied. At times I\u2019ve found it worthwhile to temporarily invest in a job-searcher LinkedIn account so I can send InMail to people I\u2019m not connected to. I make messages incredibly short: \u201cI recently applied for the [position] at [company]. I wanted to drop you a quick line to personally express how interested I am in the position. If you have any questions about my qualifications, or I can give you any additional information about myself, please do not hesitate to contact me.\u201d That\u2019s it. I give them my phone and email.", "There are exceptions to these rules. If I come across a job that looks great \u2014 not just good \u2014 and I can\u2019t find any contacts to help me find inroads, I sometimes go ahead and apply. I don\u2019t do this until I\u2019ve learned something about the company or the position that makes it easy for me to write a cover letter explaining my interest. I do this rarely, mostly because there\u2019s really very small chance that it will lead to anything.", "All of this may seem like a lot of work for relatively few applications. I know for certain that it is less draining than slowly falling into despair as more and more copies of my resume fail to return from the void.", "All of the above begs the question of what jobs are worth considering in the first place. Early in my career, I saw it as a major part of my job description to perform analyses and write up the results and accompanying recommendations. I often became frustrated when my recommendations didn\u2019t get much of a hearing. Over time, I learned to blame the decision makers within my organization less for this. I realize now that they weren\u2019t the problem. They were the symptom.", "The impact of an analytic report depends upon a whole lot of things: how much of the report the decision maker actually paid attention to; finances, logistics, and other operational concerns that limit the range of decisions that are actually viable at any given point in time; how many other, conflicting reports of varying authority and credibility the decision maker receives on the same subject; how much of the report the decision maker forgot between receiving the report and making the decision the report was supposed to inform; the rhetoric/performance/design in which the report is dressed in order to grab people\u2019s attention and get them invested in the analytic results.", "It took me much longer than I wish it had to realize that I needed to create products, not Powerpoints. That wasn\u2019t just for my own sense of accomplishment. The difference between an organization that productionizes an analysis and one that wants that analysis in a report is the difference between an organization that supports individual contributors and one that doesn\u2019t. If my employers trusted me enough to ask me to do an analysis, they should have trusted that analysis enough to have a well-defined path for those results to automate or at least augment concrete decisions within the business.", "If there\u2019s a gatekeeper that can pick and chose which results from an analysis get disseminated or acted upon, then the analysis isn\u2019t productionized. If it\u2019s not productionized, the analysis is a political tool, not a technical one. Political tools are fine. They\u2019re just not what I want to build. I spent too much of my career thinking I just needed to figure out how to present better. I actually did learn how to present better, which has certainly come in useful, but I no longer consider a job worth pursuing if it isn\u2019t the default for my work to go into production. That filters a lot of data science jobs out of my search from the very beginning.", "No job is worth an abusive, manipulative, or un-supportive boss unless I\u2019m in immediate and dire need of money. I don\u2019t just mean that I try to avoid working with difficult people. A difficult person can make your life miserable and the cost of continuing to work with a difficult person shouldn\u2019t be downplayed. But working with a difficult manager means you can put months or years of your professional life into something that dies as soon as you aren\u2019t there to constantly fight for it (and, often, even if you are still there to fight for it). Working on something that\u2019s going to die is a great way to burn out.", "When I see flip-flopping on expectations, abdicating responsibility but then calling it \u201cmanagement style\u201d, blaming employees for not understanding non-instructions, or simple dismissal of honest concerns when they are brought up, I look elsewhere for employment. The worst thing about bad managers is that they are so hard to fix. If the people who hired them recognized how bad they were, they wouldn\u2019t have been hired, but those same people are insulated from learning of their mistake because the people who might enlighten them are at risk of losing their job if they complain during their employment, and are seen as simply expressing sour grapes if they mention it when they leave.", "A bad manager is a relatively easy thing to spot, and it\u2019s a sign of an incompetent organization. If the organization were capable of handling your job function well it wouldn\u2019t have put a bad boss in charge of you because it would have known better. A bad manager is the only sure sign I\u2019ve ever seen that I need to stop pursuing a job. Anything else I may decide is worth fighting or trying to change, but not bad managers.", "Teams amplify. When I was in a good situation, a good team made me happier, more productive, and more focused. In fact, when the other aspects of the job were good, a strong team was the difference between a good work environment and a great work environment. When I was in a bad situation, however, even (in fact, especially) a very good team made things decidedly worse.", "In my first job out of graduate school, a bunch of us were initially hired to create new ways of tackling the organization\u2019s problems, but after a relatively short period of giving us freedom to innovate, the people who hired us started to consistently and actively oppose our doing anything different from how things had been done in the past. We on the team fed off of each other\u2019s negativity. Everything became a grievance. We pulled each other down as much as we had built each other up during the good times. Our core technical talent saw the writing on the wall and, one by one, left. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but that team breaking up was the best thing that could have happened to me. We had become so toxic that it was much better to go our separate ways. But I didn\u2019t see it that way at the time.", "As I\u2019ve searched for jobs, I\u2019ve often been so excited about the team I would work with that I lost sight of the larger context in which that team would need to operate. The components of a job are multiplicative, not additive. A +10 team and a -2 organization doesn\u2019t equal a +8 experience. It equals a -20 experience. But it\u2019s hard to see that in a job search because team dynamics are a lot easier to see than organizational dynamics. This is a difficult problem to spot during an interview process. It\u2019s still worth looking for.", "There\u2019s one type of situation where I ignore everything I\u2019ve written above. Early in my career, to get out of an unhealthy work situation, I took a relatively low-paying job that I viewed as almost surely a dead-end position. They\u2019d asked for someone to pull customer lists based on certain selection criteria and I had pitched the idea of doing more with the data they had, but I figured they probably didn\u2019t have any appetite for an analysis that couldn\u2019t be done in a spreadsheet. My first couple months at the company confirmed by initial impressions.", "After one day of using their horrible database front-end, I talked to the IT department, got direct access to the database, and started to teach myself SQL. Then I started to create scripts in R that called and combined specific combinations of queries based on common use cases. After a few months, my full-time duties took up between three and ten hours a week. As long as the sales team got their customer lists, I could do whatever I wanted with the rest of my time. Over the two years of that job, I went from having a barely rudimentary knowledge of SQL to being able to unabashedly list it as one of my core competencies on my resume. I started to teach myself Python. I started to use machine learning to model things like customer attrition. A new executive came on who momentarily had similar interests, so that work actually got used. At the end of about a year, my job was still a dead-end but I had a much more marketable profile.", "Even a really bad job can be good for your career. In my case, I was junior enough and competent enough that they left me enough freedom to develop new skills. Of course a good job would have been even better, and allowed me to grow even more, but that wasn\u2019t an option for me at that time in my life. I\u2019m far enough along in my career that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll need to take a stepping-stool job again. I hope I don\u2019t. But it was a useful thing when I had less experience.", "Searching for a job is stressful. When you have a family to support or a deadline by which you need to get new employment, is can be terrifying. I\u2019ve found the fear inherent in a job search is really pretty useful. Most often, I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted out of my next job any more than my prospective employers knew what they wanted out their next hire, so I\u2019d often feel torn about accepting a decent offer versus looking for a more promising opportunity. In most cases, fear prompted me to take the decent offer, which moved me along in my career.", "There have been a couple times when the fear became so big that it eclipsed every other consideration. For example, at one point in my early career, I had difficulty making rent because I had to spend the money on diapers and baby formula instead. I don\u2019t really have any good advice on how to navigate those kinds of situations \u2014 I was a constant wreck during that time. But for all other times, when I could get food on the table but wanted a little more satisfaction from my job or a little more growth in my career, I often took a big hit to my emotional health and self-respect because I didn\u2019t realize that I had the power to assert a fair amount of authority in my job search.", "In my experience, it pays to approach a job as an applicant, not a supplicant. By deciding there were certain conditions I simply would not accept, and by cutting off prospective employers as soon as they failed to demonstrate that they could accommodate those must-haves, I was able to keep myself energized and clear-headed for those opportunities that really deserved my attention.", "Your home for data science.
