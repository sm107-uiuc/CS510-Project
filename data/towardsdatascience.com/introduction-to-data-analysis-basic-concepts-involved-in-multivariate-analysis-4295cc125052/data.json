I am pretty confident that nowadays everyone has come across these terms and many are working in one of these fields.", "But what exactly is this craze of data \u2018dealing\u2019?", "It all started not too long ago when scientists observed data to be growing at an extraordinary pace(exponentially). Data has increased so much over the past few decades that it became a very difficult task for the scientists to \u2018handle\u2019 the data by themselves. Hence things like Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence were born. Because of these technologies data has been handled properly, and organizations like Google, Netflix, Facebook, etc which have to deal with tons of data excel in their job.", "The growing data increased the demands for Data Scientist and Data Analyst and hence this might be the reason that you are reading this article :)", "Now a question you might ask: But what does Data Analysis has to do with all these AI-driven fields???The answer is \u2018EVERYTHING\u2019.Data Analysis forms the basis for Data Science and based on the Data Analysis only, one can use the Data Science techniques.Look it this way, we have a lot of data available to be used, most of it, in reality, is junk and not efficient to be used directly in a machine learning algorithm.We must first \u2018rectify\u2019 the data and then use it. In other words, Data Analysis helps us to convert data to \u2018information\u2019.", "DATA ANALYSISDefinition: Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.", "In this article, I will be discussing the Multivariate Analysis and the basic concepts constituting it.", "MULTIVARIATE ANALYSISDefinition: Multivariate analysis deals with the statistical analysis of data collected on more than one dependent variable.Multivariate techniques are popular because they help organizations to turn data into knowledge and thereby improve their decision making.", "Most of the Multivariate analysis techniques are extensions of univariate(analysis of single variable) and bivariate analysis(techniques used to analyze two variables). Other multivariate techniques are solely created to deal with multivariate problems, such as discriminant analysis or factor analysis, etc.To be considered truly multivariate all the variables must be random and interrelated in such a way that their different effects can not meaningfully be interpreted separately.", "The Basic concepts of Multivariate AnalysisSome key concepts constitute the Multivariate analysis :", "The VariateThe building block of the multivariate analysis is the variate. It is defined as the weighted sum of the variables, where the weights are defined by the multivariate techniques. The variate of n weighted variables(X1 to Xn) can be written as :", "where X1, X2\u2026Xn are the observed variables and  W1, W2, W3\u2026Wn are the weights.", "But what are these variates used for? These variates capture the multivariate features of the analysis, thus in each technique, the variate acts as the focal point of the analysis.For example, in multiple regression, the variate is determined in such a manner that the correlation between the dependent variable and the independent variables is maximum.", "Measurement ScalesThe multivariate analysis involves dealing with data that has multiple variables and so the entries in these variables might have different scales. Hence \u2018measurement\u2019 of the data becomes essential. Measurement is important in accurately representing the concept of interest and is instrumental in the selection of the appropriate multivariate technique.", "Data can be classified into 2 categories :non-metric(qualitative)metric(quantitative)Determination of each variable as non-metric or metric is essential as it can change the whole analysis. This identification is done by humans as to computers everything is just numbers.", "Non-Metric Measurement ScalesNon-metric data describes differences in type or kind by indicating the presence or absence of a characteristic or property.These properties are discrete, such that it signifies only the presence of a particular feature and absence of all other features.For example gender. If a person is male then he can not be female.Performing arithmetic operations on non-metric data is meaningless as it does not give us a comparison between quantities rather it indicates the presence or absence of a feature.", "Non-metric measurements can be made by ordinal or nominal scales.", "Nominal ScalesThese scales are also called as Categorical Scales. The nominal scale assigns numbers to objects to identify them. The number assigned to the objects have no quantitative meaning beyond indicating the presence or absence of the object.For example: In the case of gender we can assign values 0 to male and 1 to female so that now when we see 0 in the gender column we say that the person is a male. But performing any arithmetic operation is meaningless as we can not do 0 +1 = 1 and say that male + female = female.Nominal Scales do not provide a measure for comparing the data as they only indicate the presence or absence.", "Ordinal Scales In the case of Ordinal scales, we can order or rank the variables to the amount they signify. In this, the objects can be compared using the logical expressions: greater than(>), less than(<) and equal to(=) only. Ordinal Scales only give the comparison between the objects but do not give the exact amount or magnitude in absolute terms.For example: Consider the figure :", "Let us say we have three cars(A, B and C) which are marked on a scale that represents their speed and ranges from slow to fast.When viewed as ordinal data we can say that C is faster than B and B is faster than A or speed of C > speed of B and speed of B > speed of A.The comparison between the speeds of the cars can be done using logical operators but we can not infer the exact or actual magnitude difference between the speeds of the cars, i.e., we can not say that difference between speeds of A and B is more than the difference of speeds between B and C.", "We can not perform arithmetic operations on the non-metric data which somehow limits the use of it in estimating model coefficients. For this reason, many multivariate techniques are devised solely to deal with non-metric data(e.g., correspondence analysis) or to use non-metric data as an independent variable. Thus we must identify all non-metric data to ensure that they are used appropriately in the multivariate techniques.", "Metric Measurement ScalesMetric data is used when the objects differ in amount or degree on a particular attribute. Metric data represent relative quantities or degree and are appropriate for attributes involving magnitude or amount, such as the speed of the car in km/hr or different prices of houses, etc.The two different metric measurement scales are :Interval ScaleRatio ScaleBoth these scales provide the most precise measurements, permitting any mathematical operation to be performed.", "Interval ScaleInterval Scale is used to measure metric data(Duh!). It measures values in terms of magnitude and not just logical operations.Consider the previous example where we had 3 cars at different speeds.Using the interval scale we can now find the exact values of the speeds of each car and also determine the exact difference between the speeds of any 2 cars.The above example clearly shows that the measurements have become precise using the interval scale.", "The difference between interval scale and ratio scale is that in ratio scale we have an absolute zero point whereas in an interval scale we have an arbitrary zero point. The most common interval scales are Celsius and Fahrenheit.None of the two scales have an absolute zero point, as zero in Celsius or Fahrenheit scale does not represent absolute zero temperature(which is 0 Kelvin and not 0\u2070 Celsius or 0\u2070 Fahrenheit), also zero in one is not equal to the zero in another. We, also, can not state that any value on an interval scale is a multiple of some other point on the scale.For example, we can not say that heat at 100\u2070 Celsius is twice as hot as heat at 50\u2070 Celsius.", "Ratio ScaleRatio Scale provides the most precise measurements as they have an absolute zero point. All mathematical operations are permissible on measurements made by ration scales. Height, age, money, weight, etc are some examples of ratio scales because any measured value can be written as a multiple of some other measured value, like 120 inches on height scale can be written as twice of 60 inches. Also, these scales possess absolute zero.", "Importance of choosing the right measurement scaleThe following points depict the importance of choosing the right scale :", "I am a data science and
