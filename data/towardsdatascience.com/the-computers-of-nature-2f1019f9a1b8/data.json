In the 1930s, Mathematician and Computer Scientist Alan Turing proofed that such a machine can in fact exists. A decade later, in 1945, Physicist John von Neumann proposed a design on how such a universal machine could actually look like. It would contain:", "This design has become known as the von-Neumann architecture, and it is blueprint of almost every modern computer today. It is said to be Turing-complete.", "We can throw all sorts of problems at such a Turing-complete machine. For example, consider the majority-class problem: in an input string of 0s and 1s, which of the two is the majority? No problem for a von-Neumann style computer, equipped with a CPU and memory, where we can design a program along the lines of the following.", "For many problems, we can write a program that can run on a von-Neumann style machine and find a solution. This is an incredibly powerful concept.", "However, there exists a different view of what a computer can be, and this view is more inspired by phenomena observed in nature. That\u2019s where we enter the fascinating world of cellular automata.", "In their simplest forms, cellular automata can be described as grids of \u2018cells\u2019 that can take on two different states, say black and white. Then, we can define \u2018rules\u2019 on how these cells should interact, such as the following.", "This particular set of rules, also known as \u2018Rule 30\u2019, is one of the 256 possible rules that can be constructed in such a way and were studied in detail by Computer Scientist Stephen Wolfram in the 1980s. With Rule 30, a black cell surrounded by two black cells would turn white, a white cell surrounded by two white cells would stay white, and so on. If we start off with a grid consisting of a single black cell and keep applying the Rule 30 to produce the next row, the following structure emerges:", "The resulting structure appears highly complex, with triangular shapes at various scales and seemingly random locations on the right side, and diagonal \u2018lines\u2019 on the left. The remarkable conclusion is that highly complex structure can emerge from simple, deterministic rules.", "But, to get back to the topic, what do cellular automata have to do with computing?", "In 1996, Computer Science researcher Melanie Mitchell and her collaborators designed a cellular automaton that can solve the majority class problem we encountered above. The task is, given an input of black and white cells, determine which of the two is the majority class, and display it by eventually switching all cells into that class. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their cellular automaton solving the problem:", "It\u2019s a little hard to see, but the first row contains a random distribution of black and white cells, with a majority of black cells. The cells then somehow \u2018propagate\u2019 the information about their local neighborhoods, and these propagations appear as diagonal lines in the resulting structure. Ultimately, all cells are switched to black, and the cellular automaton can be said to have \u2018solved\u2019 the majority-class problem.", "This particular cellular automaton can thus be said to act like a computer. This is interesting, given that this \u2018computer\u2019 lacks any of the elements of a von-Neumann style machine: it has neither a central processing unit, nor a memory unit. Instead, the cells themselves take on a dual role, propagating information and instruction at the same time.", "However, here\u2019s the big caveat: Mitchell\u2019s team spent considerable effort to design a cellular automaton that can solve a very simple problem for certain initial conditions, and it is hard to think of ways in which such a system could solve more challenging, general, and meaningful problems. Even if cellular automata can be shown to be Turing-complete (like Game of Life and Rule 110), they are far from being practical computers.", "Perhaps, then, cellular automata are really a tool for describing the world, rather then predict it.", "Ant colonies are often described as natural cellular automata. Similar to Wolfram\u2019s Rule 30 we saw above, each individual ant is following simple rules, yet the colony as a whole exhibits remarkably complex behavior.", "For instance, ants have a rule to search for food by initially walking in random directions. If an ant is successful and returns to the nest with food, it will leave a trail of pheromones, signaling to other ants to follow the same path. As more ants follow and carry back food, the pheromone signal gets amplified, creating a reinforcement loop that will go on until the food source diminishes and the pheromone signal evaporates. Thus, at any given time the existing trails and the strength of their pheromone signals form a map of the food environment discovered collectively.", "The colony is thus effectively \u2018computing\u2019 the solution to the problem of optimally routing individual ants such as to maximize food yield \u2014 and this computation is performed in a decentralized way, without a von-Neumann style central processing unit or central memory. Each individual ant is acting as a computing unit as well as an information carrier. The strategy deployed by the ants turns out to be so effective that scientists are trying to emulate it to solve human-scale problems: ant colony optimization algorithms are used to solve problems of optimal routing on streets or on the internet.", "Many phenomena in nature can be described as cellular automata: white blood cells in the immune system, neurons in the brain, stomata cells in plants, or viruses propagating through a population. In all of these systems, the fundamental cells follow a simple set of rules, yet the emergent structure appears highly complex.", "Ultimately then, cellular automata could be considered nature\u2019s way of solving the non-trivial computational problem of survival.", "If you liked this story, also make sure to check out these:", "Your home for data science.
