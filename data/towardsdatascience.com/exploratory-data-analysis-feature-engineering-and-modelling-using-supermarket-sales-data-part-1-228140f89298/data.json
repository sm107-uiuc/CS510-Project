If you are a beginner in machine learning and data science and need a practical and intuitive explanation of these concepts, then this series is for you.", "The series is divided into three parts which I\u2019ll write over the coming weeks.", "Part 1: Learn how to explore and gain insights from a dataset.", "Part 2: Learn the basics of feature engineering with knowledge gained from data exploration.", "Part 3: Modelling and feature importance.", "Before we start this journey, we\u2019ll need to define some important terms that we\u2019ll use in this and subsequent posts.", "First, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) What is it?", "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. (source: Wikipedia)", "In summary, EDA can show us hidden relationships and attributes present in our data even before we throw it at a machine learning model.", "Next up, F.E (Feature Engineering) who are you?", "Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning and is both difficult and expensive. (source: Wikipedia)", "In summary, FE is simply using your existing knowledge of the dataset to create new features that can help a machine learning model perform better. Let\u2019s see an example. Assuming I have a dataset on different car types as shown below;", "Now, let\u2019s say I want to predict the price of a car from the information in this dataset, I can use my domain knowledge of cars to create extra features that can help a machine learning model perform better on this task. Features like the speed of the car or the type of engine. I could even take it further by adding boolean features like:", "1. Does the car have an Infotainment System?", "2. Does the car have rear-seat entertainment?", "3. Is the car an all-wheel or a 4-wheel drive? e.t.c", "You get the hang of it.", "I could also create features from the existing ones by doing what we call Feature crossing (More on this in the next post).", "Now that we\u2019re familiar with the terms EDA and FE, let\u2019s get our data and start exploring.", "We\u2019ll be using a dataset of supermarket sales provided by Data Science Nigeria. Here\u2019s a link to the data.", "We\u2019ll use the popular prototyping tool Jupyter Notebooks and sorry \u201cR\u201d folks, I\u2019ll be using Python for this exploration.", "After downloading your data, place it in the same folder as your notebook so you can access it. Start your notebook and import the following libraries as shown below.", "Next, let\u2019s read in our data.", "Note: I transposed the train.head() command because I wanted to see all rows and columns on a single page without scrolling horizontally.", "Now that we can see our data and the features it contains. Let\u2019s get down to business.", "First, we need to know our target variable.", "We could pick any feature to be our target and that will, in turn, tell us the kind of model we\u2019ll build.", "For example, if we pick Product_Fat_Content to be our target variable, then we\u2019ll have a classification problem and if we decided to pick Product_Price then it becomes a regression problem.", "But since we\u2019re not concerned with building models in this post, we\u2019ll just assume we\u2019re trying to predict Product_Supermarket_Sales (Total number of sales made by a supermarket).", "Next, Let\u2019s know our features. Since the number of features is small, we can manually look at them and instantly remove the ones that aren\u2019t worth exploring or putting into our model. We\u2019ll use our domain knowledge of a supermarket for this.", "I usually take out a pen and paper, draw five columns as shown below and manually fill it for all features:", "You could do this any other way though. Let\u2019s look at these features.", "Now that we\u2019ve manually gone through our data and found almost all the features to be important (some are still under scrutiny though), we can start our EDA.", "The first thing I like to do when doing EDA on a dataset with a reasonable amount of numeric columns is to check the relationship between my target variable and these numeric features. One quick way to do this is to use the seaborn heatmap plot. This seaborn heatmap takes the correlation matrix calculated on the numerical features in our dataset and makes a heated plot of it. Enter the code below to make a heatmap plot.", "Now let\u2019s interpret the plot above. Take a look at it and see what insight you can draw from it.", "If you don\u2019t know how to interpret a heatmap plot, the next few paragraphs are for you. If you do, please skip it.", "Each square in a heatmap shows how much any two feature correlates (is there some kind of relationship between them). Does the increase in one feature result in the increase of the other? (Positive correlation) or does the increase in one result in the decrease of the other? (Negative correlation).", "Now, let\u2019s interpret the labels inside the square.", "Tracing Label 3 horizontally to the left leads to Product_Weight and tracing it vertically downwards, leads to Product_Price. This means the square box (3) is showing us how correlated Product_Weight and Product_Price are. We can see that they\u2019re not really correlated as the square is almost cold.", "Label 4 shows the correlation between Product_Price and Product_Supermarket_Sales. We clearly see that the region is hot, meaning there\u2019s a high correlation.", "And that\u2019s how you interpret a heatmap.", "Okay, you\u2019ve just graduated with a degree in heatmap reading. Now, you\u2019re at your first Job and the heatmap below is laid before you.", "Your boss looks up at you with full confidence that he has hired the right guy and demands for an answer.", "You got up, take one look at the heatmap, smiled, and said:", "Well, this plot shows that the Product_Price is the most correlated feature with our target of interest Product_Supermarket_Sales, and it makes sense with our intuition that if more expensive products are sold, then the total product_Supermarket_Sales will likely increase and vice versa.", "Your boss nods and asks you to go on. You\u2019re full of confidence now and continues.", "Another correlation I can see \u2014 through small \u2014 is between Product_Price and Supermarket_Opening_Year.", "So what does this mean your boss asks.", "Well, in summary, this is telling us that the supermarket opening year seems to be affecting the prices of products. It could be positively (Newer Supermarkets sell more) or it could be negative (Old Supermarkets have more loyal customers and sell more). I\u2019d have to investigate and find more about this.", "Besides that, there are no other interesting correlations from this plot Sir. But these are just the numeric features. I\u2019ll still have to check with the categorical features.", "Your boss is happy, he gives you a firm handshake and asked you to investigate further reporting to him the next day.", "And off you go, to do some more exploration.", "First, you decided to investigate the relationship between all the features in the dataset. So you wanted to plot each feature against the others, but you want to do this once without writing multiple for loops.", "Well, Seaborn\u2019s pairplot( ) comes to the rescue.", "If you\u2019ve not seen a seaborn pairplot before, this is what it looks like. It\u2019s basically a one-line wonder. It plots all features in the dataset against each other just like the heatmap( ) function except this gives a more visual plot. We can also specify a categorical feature we want to use for coloring.", "Note: The Seaborn pairplot only plots numerical features, but we can color our plots based on a selected categorical column. Also, the pairplot will throw an error if the dataset you pass to it contains missing values.", "So First, let\u2019s check for columns with missing values, so we don\u2019t add them to our pairplot.", "Well, we have two columns with missing values, Supermarket_size, which is a categorical feature and Product_Weight which is a numeric feature. We\u2019ll work on these missing features in our next post, for now, let\u2019s just exclude them from our pairplot( ) columns.", "After running the code above, we\u2019ll have a total of four plots. Let\u2019s look at them one after the other and try to interpret or draw insights from them.", "If you notice any other relationships, please notify me by dropping a comment below.", "Remember, if you notice any interpretation I missed, use the comment box below.", "Looking at the plot, we can instantly see that the different supermarkets are almost finely separated. There are lots of insights we can draw from this:", "As always, if you notice any good interpretation I may have missed, please notify me in the comment box below.", "Wheeeeew! Its been a long first post. Well hopefully, you learned a lot.", "In my next post, we\u2019ll talk about Feature Engineering and Creation. There, we\u2019ll bring to life all the intuition we\u2019ve gathered while doing this EDA.", "My parting advice to you is that you get a dataset, poke it, tear it apart, find the hidden gems and derive insights from it, and also have fun while at it.", "But Remember, EDA is an art, It can be done in many different ways; The steps listed above are by no means an outline you must follow rigidly. Do what works for you.", "Notebook and data for this post can be found here", "Questions, comments and contributions are always welcome.", "Your home for data science.
