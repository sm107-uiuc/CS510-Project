Back then, many of us began to adopt technical terms restricted only to the medical community \u2014 for example, saturated fat, glucose levels, and HDL (aka the good cholesterol).", "As a consequence, we became demanding consumers when it comes to personal health. The heath and food industries have listened to us, and now, we have access to a range of organic food delivered to our doors, apps tracking menstrual cycles, and DNA-based diets. Because scientific changes are slow and gradual, we often take them for granted and become blind to innovation opportunities.", "Like nutrition and the health industry, neuroscience and data-driven business will radically change the way we live. Why? From hormones levels to behaviour and emotions, the brain controls everything in our body.", "Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, in particular its structure and functions. It is an important scientific field for human health because neuroscience combines anatomy, psychology, physiology, statistics, cell biology and data science through computational models [1]. Simply put, neuroscience is the science of the brain.", "Suppose you use health monitoring apps that track heart rate, running statistics, calories intake. You are relying on data to explain what is happening in your body. More importantly, you gain insights on how to improve your health and reduce the risk of health-related issues.", "Similarly, neuroscience data will enable you to understand: your emotions, motivations, decisions, addictions, memories, stress, learning speed, immune system, sex hormones levels, obsessions and many other mechanisms influencing our health and behaviour. Can you imagine being able to track and control those changes in your body? If the brain affects who you are, but you can control the brain, then you could control who you are.", "Probably, the first case study in any neuroscience course involves a railroad construction worker called Phineas Gage, who survived a horrible accident. He had a metal bar through his head, which destroyed part of his brain (mostly in the frontal area). Why is this case so important? It shows every student that brain damage has a negative influence on one\u2019s behaviours and emotions.", "Before the accident, Gage was known for his personal and social responsibility, always with good judgement and strong character. However, after the accident, Gage showed no concern about his future or any respect for social norms; his personality had changed considerably. Despite the shift in personality, Gage\u2019s cognitive skills (intelligence, memory and attention) were intact. This famous case study suggests that anyone can change behavioural and emotional traits.", "What if we control different areas of the brain, just like we can control insulin levels in diabetic patients? This is already relatively possible. Neuroscience and data driven ideas are driving the next multi-million-dollars niche: Neurotech. The brain is the next big frontier for entrepreneurs and Data Scientists alike. Here are two reasons:", "Neuroscience can improve the lives of many people, including yours. How? Just take a look at the impact on a common problem among us such as depression.", "Depression is a disabling mental illness; it\u2019s characterised by sadness, extreme tiredness and other mild cognitive disorders [3]. It affects a person\u2019s life in many ways: impairing a child\u2019s ability to learn and enjoy school, an adult\u2019s ability to work and have a social life. In its severest form, depression can lead to suicide [4]. Mental health problems create a snowball effect.", "Depression represents a global public health challenge affecting over 300 million people, and by 2030 it will be the most significant cause of disability in the world [5]. By then, the economic impact of brain disorders will reach \u00a34.9 trillion ($6 trillion). This amount is more than the cost of cancer, diabetes and respiratory conditions combined [6]. So, where there is a problem, there is an opportunity for innovation.", "Data Science is driving the scientific revolution in Neuroscience. For example, a neurotech startup called Kernel develops mind, body and machine learning for clinical use. Their technology analyses brain data to stimulates electrical impulses in the brain (firing neurons) to control Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "Similarly, Elon Musk, who is the owner of Tesla and Space X, runs a company called Neuralink. Their focus is to develop a high bandwidth brain-machine interface to connect humans and computers. Neuralink build tools to communicate with the brain and help people with paralysis to regain independence.", "What is more exciting about their technology is that you can control neurological problems even with mobile devices. Although Neuralink\u2019s technologies are at its initial stages, there is a massive potential for an entirely new industry: Neural health", "Well, if you are either an entrepreneur or Data Scientist then there is a massive opportunity in front you. Neurotech startups need to develop ways of collecting brain data. People are learning more and more about the brain and how to control their thoughts. However, the challenge lies in recording data without any invasive method (like drilling a hole in someone\u2019s skull) or relying on animal testing (which has low rates of translation).", "Neuroscience is the next big thing in our lives. The more we discover about our brain, the more demanding we will become with products and services associated with our health. There is an enormous opportunity for entrepreneurs and data scientists alike developing different ways of communication between brain and computer. However, one of the biggest challenges involves recording data without invasive methods. Still, neuroscience will change our lives, including the products we buy. Now is the best time for entrepreneurs and Data Scientists who deep dive into a growing niche: neurotech.", "Thanks for reading.
