Beyond student- led events, industry leaders such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have all recognized the utility of such events, sponsoring or running hackathons of their own. Combining an intense coding and presentation project with aspects of networking over a bed of deodorant, snacks, and sleeping bags, hackathons present great opportunities for students to evaluate their solution-building capabilites under highly stressful conditions.", "Essentially, a hackathon is a microcosm of the pipeline process for developing a startup: you do your own research, build a MVP, and deliver a pitch to an audience, over the course of up to 48 hours. You\u2019ll go through some wild mood swings, very little sleep, but learn a lot about your ability to work under pressure, adversity, and delivering on ideas. In particular, the team-based orientation of such challenges is an effective test of one\u2019s teamwork capabilities: indeed, while professional hackathon \u201ccrews\u201d are common, learning to work with new teammates is a much more realistic simulation of an corporate engineering environment.", "But given the possibility of a large number of teams in a hackathon, how do we stand out and build an award winning entry? Naturally, there\u2019s always an element of luck involved, but we do have control over a select number of key aspects:", "To illustrate these points in practice , we\u2019ll go over our winning entry to 48-hour Singapore 2018 NASA SpaceApps Challenge\u2019s environmental theme \u2014 Sammuta, a multimodal early detection solution to wildfire management.", "Note, as we\u2019ve previously covered pitching and presentations in a separate article on GradientCrescent, we won\u2019t be spending too much time on them here. We\u2019ll also stay away from discussing team-building and other interpersonal skills, and orient this article to focusing on the solution itself.", "Over the past year, wildfires in Australia captured the attention of the world. With over 15 million acres scorched and over 100 species now feared extinct, the incident has become a tragic reminder of the effects of man-made climate change.", "While the exact causes of this season\u2019s fire remain disputed, climate change has resulted in an accelerated rate in wildfire incidence, with increasing temperatures and a large amount of dry tinder resulting in a powder keg for ignition. California, a known hub for wildfires, has now moved beyond \u201cfire season\u201d into an all-year phenomenon, and previously safe areas such as Sweden are now observing an incidence of wildfires. From 2017\u20132018, over $233 billion has been spent on wildfire-related activities. These are all facts you should utilize in your presentation, as framing the problem with an emotional context is key to getting your message across to audiences. This is discussed in detail in our previous article on pitching.", "Our solution to this problem consisted of an early multimodal detection model to wildfires, featuring three key components:", "All of these components can be acquired commercially off-the-shelf, resulting in a cost-effective, rapidly implementable solution .By using a disposable, rugged, cheap detection map for each community, we can ensure effective coverage while remaining economical and energy efficient. Programming an aerial observation drone to fly to specific coordinates of a tripped sensor is facile, and has been previously demonstrated for search and rescue services.", "However, it was important to narrow down on an effective demonstration component for the purpose of the competition. We decided that a vision-based mobile detection system would be the most feasible and visually striking solution. Given the temporal and resource limitations of the hackathon, any solution would have to fulfill the following criteria:", "To fulfill these requirements, we decided to utilize Transfer Learning and Tensorflow Lite to train a real-time mobile wildfire classifier for Android devices.", "Our final Tensorflow Lite implementation for Android Devices , together with the Python scripts needed for training, can be found in the GradientCrescent repository. You\u2019ll need to install Tensorflow (1.9 or above) along with the TOCO converter into your workspace to attempt the retraining process. You\u2019ll also need Android Studio to compile and build the final .apk files yourself, although we do provide a copy in the repository.", "Tensorflow Lite is a compression technique designed to adapt standard Tensorflow graph models into lightweight, highly-responsive packages suitable for fast-performance on a light footprint. Such applications include lower-end mobile devices that would be suitable for semi-disposable applications. It allows for the use of quantization conversion techniques, where a model\u2019s parameters can be converted into a 8-bit format, shown to reduce model size while improving on latency. At inference, such data is reconverted back into its original format, resulting in a minimal effect on classification accuracy.", "We\u2019ve covered Transfer Learning in a previous article. Essentially, transfer learning refers to the fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural network on a new dataset. The principle here is that the features in the old classes and new data classes are shared, and hence can be applied to target new target classes. While retraining a pre-trained MobileNetV1 network is a facile process using the Tensorflow library, we can perform transfer learning directly from the terminal through scripting.", "Firstly, we defined some classes in order to undergo a retraining process. For the purpose of our demonstration, we did a Google Image Search to obtain around 250 images of wildfires, forests, and of sandwiches (humor never hurt any submission after all). Our retraining script can be found in the script \u201cretrain.py\u201d, modified from the official Tensorflow repository. This script can be invoked from a terminal, making it exceptionally beginner friendly as no additional scripting is required.", "Our final model utilized a pre-trained MobileNetV1 architecture for input images with 224 x 224 resolution, featuring 75% quanitzation. This was preceded by extensive testing of various architectures in order to achieve a balance between millisecond-level response time and classification accuracy. Generally, the more complex the architecture and the lower the level of quantization, the slower your model will perform.", "We then invoke our retraining script with the terminal command, specifying the training time, the specific pre-trained model architecture, preprocessing parameters, as well as our input and output directories:", "Our retrained model here is the retrained graph output, however this is not yet an Android compatible Tensorflow Lite (.tflite) file. To facilitate the conversion, we must first freeze our graph file using the \u201cfreeze.py\u201d script, and then utilize the TOCO converter to convert our file via another terminal command:", "Once conversion is complete, we transferred our model into our Android platform in Android studio. In the interests of time, we built our solution on top of a demonstration app available in the Tensorflow repository. Note that an explanation of all of the elements of the app, Android Studio, or Java is beyond the scope of this tutorial \u2014 we\u2019ll focus on building our demo functionality here instead.", "In a straightforward process, We move our Tensorflow Lite solution, consisting of the labels and the .tflite model file, into the \u201cassets\u201d resource directory within your Android Studio Project.", "We then specify the names of our model and labels within the ImageClassifierQuantizedMobileNet java file.", "We then built a new cosmetic layout for our app by modifying the camerafragment.xml layout file:", "Finally, we can create a threshold for our classifier, which we use here to launch visual toasts, but could be used for communication applications in a final product.", "We can then compile our solution and build our .apk file, and transfer this onto our Android device.", "Here\u2019s a live demonstration of our final solution.", "With our demo and slides, we were able to achieve a first-place victory at the NASA SpaceApps Challenge with a team consisting of complete strangers of diverse backgrounds, over roughly 12 hours of work. You can view our presentation video for the Global Finals below:", "That wraps up this little aside into Tensorflow Lite. In our next article, we\u2019ll go back into exploring Reinforcement Learning, by demonstrating its utilities in a Doom gym environment.", "We hope you enjoyed this article, and hope you check out the many other articles covering applied and theoretical aspects of AI.
