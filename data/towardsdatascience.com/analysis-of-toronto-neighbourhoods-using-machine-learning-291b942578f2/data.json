This made me excited for the millions of people looking for a pathway to Canada since I recently relocated here. A 2020 US news ranking showed Canada as the 2nd best country in the world, so it is not a surprise that every year, thousands of people choose to migrate here [2]. Asides from having a stable economy and many growth opportunities, Canada has offered many immigrants a new home. In 2019, Canada opened its borders to 341,000 people with 35% of them settling in the City of Toronto [3]. Hence, it is safe to say that the City of Toronto is a top destination for most new immigrants.", "The City of Toronto has 140 neighbourhoods spanning 6 districts. As a new immigrant, a vital question to answer is \u201cWhat neighbourhood do I settle in?\u201d. The aim of this project is to group Toronto neighbourhoods in order of desirability using Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques.", "There are several factors to consider when settling down in any location. For this project, I performed my analysis using the following criteria:", "Most of the datasets were obtained from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. Other datasets were scraped from the web. They include:", "The Python libraries used on this project were Numpy, Pandas, Geopandas, Plotly, Scikit learn, Requests and Geopy. All visualizations were done using Plotly library because the visualizations are very interactive and can be achieved with fewer lines of code.", "The GitHub repo for this project can be found here while the Jupyter notebook can be viewed here.", "The main steps for this project are summarized in the flowchart below:", "The Interactive Charts and Maps in the rest of this article are best viewed using a Computer or tablet", "Firstly, I obtained top 100 venues in each neighbourhood by sending a request via the Foursquare API. A total of 2118 venues and 291 unique venue categories were returned.", "Using One-hot encoding, I converted the venue categories to numerical values for each neighbourhood to carry out further analysis. The total number of essential venues such as restaurants, schools, train stations, malls etc. were computed for each neighbourhood. From the Sunburst chart below, we can see all 6 Toronto districts and their respective neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods are displayed based on proportion of the total number of essential venues present in them. Click/Tap on chart to explore further.", "Quick Facts Check: There are more coffee shops and restaurants in Toronto than there are neighbourhoods with over 900 restaurants spanning across the city", "After a clean-up of the individual datasets for the primary benchmarks, I merged them into one Pandas dataframe as shown below.", "The dataframe was converted to an interactive bubble chart below. Crime rates represented by the bubble size. Click/Tap on the legend on the Bubble chart to isolate a district and explore further.", "Quick Stats Check: Average Unemployment rate is 8.3%. Average number of crimes committed per 100,000 people is 1378 and 1 in 100 persons had contracted COVID-19 as at October 2020.", "A clustering algorithm, \u201ck-means\u201d, was used to group the neighbourhoods in order of desirability for new immigrants. k-means is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm that groups the data points such that all neighbourhoods with similar data points are in the same cluster.", "The steps below were used to segment the neighbourhoods:", "The outcome of the clustering steps above was used to rank the neighbourhoods into four categories. Neighbourhoods that belonged to the Mid & High clusters in Step 3 were named as the Least desirable while those with Low, Mid and High housing prices in Step 4 were named as Most Desirable, Desirable and Semi-Desirable respectively. The final neighbourhood desirability index was made into a choropleth map below using Plotly library.", "From the results, we can make the following deductions:", "All references used for this project have been hyperlinked within the write-up.
