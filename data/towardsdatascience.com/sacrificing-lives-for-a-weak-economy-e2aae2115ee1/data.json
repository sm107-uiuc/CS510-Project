We now have plenty of data to take stock and evaluate how countries have performed in combating the virus. The U.S. has employed a haphazard response to the pandemic, with no clear national plan and inconsistent strategies used by state and local leaders. This lack of leadership has led to a weak economy and incredibly high death rates.", "The chart below shows a high-level timeline of the pandemic to-date. Europe had the first significant outbreak with peak mortality occurring April 10, with the U.S. peak occurring two weeks later on April 24 and Canada, another two weeks later on May 7. Latin America experienced its peak much later in the summer. After a terrible initial outbreak, the pandemic largely subsided in both Europe and Canada. However, the U.S. charted a different course.", "Instead of stopping the spread of the virus, many U.S. states chose to keep their economies open. Political leaders downplayed the risks of the virus and encouraged people to live life uninterrupted. The result is that mortality in the U.S. stayed much higher than in other wealthy countries, with a curve that resembles the poorer Latin American region. The U.S. GDP per capita is four times higher than even the wealthiest Latin American country \u2014 we should have had the resources to fight this virus.", "COVID skeptics saw efforts to slow the spread of the virus as fundamentally misguided. They said the virus is just like the flu (it\u2019s not), and even if it is deadly, the economy is more important than saving lives. Critics of governors that chose to fight the virus loved to point out how Sweden was a shining example of a country that did little to combat the virus, and yet people still seemed to be enjoying themselves. The numbers show that lax approaches have not worked.", "The chart below illustrates COVID-19 mortality rates, along with the economic impact of COVID for thirty of the wealthiest countries. The economic impact is the difference between the projected economic growth for 2020 and what would have likely occurred without COVID. The International Monetary Fund projects that the U.S. economy will suffer 22% less than the median country, but our mortality rate is 457% higher than the median. This mortality/growth trade-off is unfavorable to say the least, especially since a quarter of these countries have both lower mortality and better economic outcomes. The U.S. could have saved over 170,000 lives by achieving just the median mortality rate, which would have required earlier action and better coordination.", "The best approach would have been an aggressive early response. Consider the actions of three successful countries: South Korea, Japan, and Germany. Each country was exposed to a rash of cases early on, stemming from outbreaks in China and Italy. Combinations of adherence to mask-wearing, social distancing/movement restrictions, and high-volume testing plus isolation and contact-tracing allowed these countries to halt the spread of the virus. The results show that South Korea tops the charts with the second-lowest mortality and second-best economic outcome. Despite its elderly population, Japan had the third-lowest mortality rate and the fifth-best financial outcome. Germany has better than median mortality and growth, performing far better than its Western neighbors.", "On the other hand, a fair reading of the data shows that Sweden\u2019s lax approach was not a good example to follow. The table below shows that Sweden and its Nordic neighbors have similar economies and demographics. The difference is Sweden\u2019s minimal response to COVID, with a maximum stringency index 35% lower than its neighbors. The outcome is that Sweden suffered seven times the mortality of neighboring Norway, Finland, and Denmark, without the economic performance to show for the sacrifice.", "Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic became a hot political issue, given that efforts to slow the disease would have economic costs. Reasonable people could disagree on that balancing act, but the public discourse quickly devolved into skeptics peddling conspiracy theories and bad science. Countries like Germany show us what could have been, with science and reasoned debate driving superior outcomes. The U.S. needs to hold its leaders to the same high expectations this November.", "Code and data used in this article can be found here.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
