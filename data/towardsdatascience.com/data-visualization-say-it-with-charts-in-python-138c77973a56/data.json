Companies use BI to detect significant events like gaining insights into customer behavior, monitoring key performance indicators over time and gaining market and sales intelligence to adapt quickly to their changing and dynamic business. Visualization forms the backbone of any BI, hence an analyst or data scientist needs to understand the nuances of visualization and how it plays an important role in communicating insights and findings effectively.", "We will lay down some business questions using real-world data and get an understanding of how to create presentations in Python that are powerful, effective and insightful, the PEI framework of visualization.", "Data and analytics are changing the basis of competition. Leading companies are using their capabilities not only to improve their core operations but to launch entirely new business models. Topline KPIs (Key Performing Indicators) are becoming the need of the hour with CXOs keeping a constant track of the ever dynamic market thus enabling them to make informed decisions at scale. Dashboards are becoming popular among the stakeholders and with the large influx of data collected over numerous data sources, visualization forms the key to analyzing this data. In short four main reasons to build visuals involve:", "Before we start let us take a look at the fundamentals of charts in visualization. Charts generally fall under two broad categories:", "Data charts are the most widely used chart type in the analytics industry. From dashboards, regular reports to presentations they play an important role in communicating our analysis in a way that stakeholders can understand. Concept chart plays a major role in consulting and strategy outlining, especially in scenarios where stepwise outlining of strategy is important or scenarios that require a SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, Threat).", "Want to read more about the current BI trends in the market?", "While working with platforms like Excel, Python, R, Tableau, R Shiny, Power BI or Qliksense, users are exposed to multiple chart layouts that are attractive and eye-catching. However, in the world of analytics more than creating an attractive visualization, it is important to create a visualization that is effective and impactive. Below is the selection framework the forms the basis of any chart selection.", "Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. It was created by John Hunter, who was a neurobiologist and was working on analyzing Electrocorticography signals. His team had access to a licensed version of proprietary software for the analysis and was able to use it in turns only. To avoid this limitation, John developed a MATLAB based version which in the later stages was equipped with a scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics, currently known as matplotlib.", "Matplotlib operates on a three-layer architecture system, The Backend Layer, Artist Layer & Scripting Layer.", "Let\u2019s look at the code below:", "We can see that to plot a histogram of random numbers using a combination of backend and artist layer, we need to work out multiple lines of the code snippet. To reduce this effort, Matplotlib introduced the scripting layer called Pyplot.", "\u201cmatplotlib.pyplot\u201d is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some changes to a figure, e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In matplotlib.pyplot various states are preserved across function calls so that it keeps track of things like the current figure and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the current axes.", "The same output can be generated directly through pyplot using fewer lines of code.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the example below to understand how we can create different plots using matplotlib and pyplot in python. We will be using the Suicide Rates Overview Data from Kaggle to plot some of the graphs discussed above.", "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
