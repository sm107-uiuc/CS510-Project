Let me know how you like them. For more in-depth analysis:", "Another election cycle, another time we are bewildered by the overall results. There was no blowout for any side. The election was a nail biter. Both Democrats and Republicans made unexpected inroads in several races.", "Facing the rising uncertainty each election cycles, a friend of mine acclaimed:", "The one thing we know for sure is that California has never, and will never turn Red.", "Well, for one, it is historically incorrect \u2014 California had been consistently voting Red before the \u201992 election\u00b9. My friend would have to qualify his observation to \u201celections that he observed [since 1992]\u201d, or if he changed the place to District of Columbia. However, he will still be less confident about his projection if he knew that even in this election, a third of the 10 million votes in California was casted for President Trump\u00b2. Just because we [seemingly] observe a place to be a Democratic stronghold does not mean that it cannot turn Red in the future and vice versa.", "The type of projections my friend made is a very common mental induction that we all exercise on a daily basis. Just as airplanes should not crash, wisdom teeth removal should not cause nerve damage and a reigning Premier League champion should not be upset by a team wallowing in the fifth tier of English football. In reality, however, these things do happen. Just because I have not ran into any accidents on a motorbike for the last 10 years does not mean the risk of accident is 0.", "The question is: can we quantify the probability of something that has yet to occur? Ideally, we would want to assign a probability to the rare event, but the numerators for these events are 0, and our hands are tied. A convenient way to quantify the amount of risk in these cases is called the Rule of Three:", "If a certain event did not occur in a sample with n subjects, the interval from 0 to 3/n is a 95% confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population.", "One thing to note here is that the smaller the sample observed, the wider the confidence interval, meaning the upper limit of a confidence interval from a small sample is greater than that from a large sample. But it would be wrong to say that the true probability of an adverse event occurring is larger in a small series.", "The proof of this rule is quite simple, denoting the number of events by X and the probability that we observe an adverse event by p (p is close to 0), we want to find the values of the parameter p of a binomial distribution of n observation that give Pr(X = 0) \u2264 0.05.", "And so we need to solve for p such that:", "Then we can approximate the entity ln(1-p) by using the Maclaurin series, which is the evaluation of the Taylor expansion of function f(x) at a = 0", "While the math is clear and simple, to demonstrate that it actually works, we can try to run a simple simulation:", "This is a snippet of the R code:", "As you can see, in the long run, about 95% of the interval [0, 3/n] such intervals should contain the true underlying probability of defect.", "So let us come back to the original questions: let\u2019s forget all the elections before 1992. Since we have not observed California voting Red for the last 8 elections, using the rule of three, we can deduce that the 95% confidence interval of California going red is between 0 and 3/8 = 37.5%. For District of Columbia, it would be [0, 3/15= 20%].", "To be clear, this is a fun example, and to make it work, I have to make some sweeping assumptions here, none of which is probably true.", "So what is the Rule of Three actually used for? The very popular use case is in pre-licensure clinical trials where the adverse event rate is very rare e.g. vaccine development program. Usually, a sample size in the range of 10,000 subjects can be considered adequate for establishing the protective efficacy of a new vaccine, but not sufficient for detecting the rarer events or complications.", "If no event of any particular sort has been observed during a pre-licensure clinical program involving 10,000 individuals, it can be estimated that this event rate has an upper limit of 3 per 10,000. The actual complication rates, those occurring at a lower frequency than the vaccine-targeted disease, can only be detected by some reliable post-marketing surveillance systems.", "So the next time your dentist says he never fails a procedure, you know what to do: ask him how many patients he has served, used the rule of three to find the confidence interval for his failure rate, and see how comfortable you are with the upper bound.", "You can find the code for the article at my Github page.", "[1] Why Is California a Blue State?", "[2] How this year\u2019s ballot measures show California\u2019s growing political divide", "Your home for data science.
