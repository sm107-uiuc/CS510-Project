Then study the Iris dataset and solve the Titanic challenge. Finally, schedule some scripts on Windows task scheduler. Anyone who works with data somehow went through those situations. If you got a job in data, soon you realize that you can\u2019t run a critical business script on your laptop. The one that stays on 24/7 in the office. So we go after benchmark, watch some talk or read some post and hear something like:", "We use Airflow to orchestrate ETL and machine learning at our company.", "So we start studying Airflow to learn everything about DAGs and Operators. Then we realize that Airflow is still running on our laptop. And that it is not so different from the old task scheduler we were using before. And that critical script keeps running on our machine. So some developer approaches us to say:", "You should be running this on AWS EC2.", "So we find the documentation and read everything, to only understand anything. We go after some more online courses, and we get beautiful certificates to display on LinkedIn. Yet the more we study, the more we get lost. Warning: the number of technologies to learn increases exponentially with the number of posts and courses completed.", "Now we need to learn Docker, Kubernetes, SageMaker, ECS, Git, Spark, Scala, VPC, Terraform, CircleCI, Lambda, APIs, MLFlow, NiFi, CloudWatch, Jenkins, DBT. And it looks like we need to learn all that before running the bloody hell Airflow on AWS. Or before putting some ML model in production. At the same time, we don\u2019t find any specific and relevant content to help us move forward.", "Congratulations! You have hit the great data market wall.", "A data scientist\u2019s job IS NOT 80% cleaning and 20% modeling. A data engineer\u2019s job IS NOT only about ETL. The responsibilities are much higher. And they usually involve productionizing your scripts and models.", "Then you analyze the internet content about data. And you notice that it doesn\u2019t fit your study needs anymore neither helps you solve some specific problems (like productionizing code). There isn\u2019t too much content available for anyone who got to this stage. That is the wall that is there.", "There are a lot of clickbait links out there. There are also a handful of courses, posts, and tutorials for beginners that often sell the idea that all you need for doing data science is a Jupyter Notebook. But there is little content for people who are past the beginner level. There are not too many posts teaching people how to jump over the wall to productionize their models.", "The sad reality is that if you want to put something in production, it will be only you, God, and the documentation. And that is only valid when the documentation is well written.", "The good news is that everything starts to get easier, obvious, fast, and reproducible once you are past the wall. You are going to spend quite some time to create your first automated deploy script. From the second time forward, it will be much faster.", "Now discussing why the wall exists is a little deeper. I do see two explanations:", "If you feel overwhelmed because you think you should learn trillions of new things, then calm down. Take a deep breath, and try to follow some of this advice.", "If you need to learn some new technology, then don\u2019t try to learn everything it offers. Study only the basics to get familiar with it. Let\u2019s say you want to deploy some ML models in production: you could study some frameworks like Serverless or Zappa. But only enough for you to have a gross understanding of how they work.", "After studying the essentials, it\u2019s time to try deploying using what you learned. Of course, you are going to fail. Then explore the error, make good use of Google, change stuff around, and try again. And repeat until you get it working. You\u2019ll have learned more about that technology than any course or blog post could have taught you in one or two weeks. You will have learned only enough for deploying your model. But you did it alone, using brute force, and at each iteration, you learned something new. With every silly mistake, you got more experience.", "It might be the case that you won\u2019t be able to immediately use that technology with another purpose. But if you ever need to, you will be better prepared and able to learn much faster.", "After having something that you judge is ready for production, ask a developer to review it. They are used to peer-reviewing code and know a lot of good practices you could use. Don\u2019t go into the detail of the algorithm or script you are executing. The goal is to understand if your code is ready for production. It is quite likely that you will get back a list of things to improve.", "From my own experience, I can say that asking a dev to teach you something new is not very helpful. They usually won\u2019t have time to hold your hand and teach you new technologies. The exceptions are the tools they use every day, such as Git and CircleCI. But even though they help you, you are probably only good for a few introductory lessons. After that, it\u2019s the brute force method again.", "What is going to happen if I have 1000 simultaneous requests to my API? What if the ETL job fails in the middle, will I lose or have duplicate data? How do I quickly identify if the job stopped working? How do I know if my ML model is running but returning incorrect results? What if my API receives an invalid payload?", "Thinking about the edge cases will help you anticipate solutions for those problems. And they happen more frequently than you could imagine.", "When you create data projects that will run in production, try to apply some best practices:", "If you need to stop all jobs and bring a new instance up manually every time you need to redeploy, your code is not production-ready. If you need to touch the code to change some configuration, because it is hardcoded, then your project is also not production-ready.", "If you are already past the wall, you could create content for this public that has learned the basics, but don\u2019t know how to productionize something. Write tutorials, blog posts, or create public repositories to help other people get through the wall.", "Some time ago, I spent almost one month trying to deploy Airflow in production on AWS. I could only find basic content teaching how to use it with Docker on my machine. After a lot of research, I found a repo that helped me deploy it with Terraform on ECS. But it still didn\u2019t have all the specific needs we had for a production environment, such as autoscaling. Recently I published a repo that solves some of those problems. If I spent almost one month with that, I guess other people do that too. So why not help them?", "Creating bridges to help people cross this challenging phase of their careers is good for everyone.", "Those who publish content: will deepen their knowledge and improve the portfolio.", "Those who are suffering to cross the wall will learn faster to productionize and apply best practices.", "Do you prefer to have someone with proper notions of productionization joining your team? Or you prefer to start teaching them that the task scheduler is not a viable option?", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I write about data and software engineering, career and everything in between!"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
