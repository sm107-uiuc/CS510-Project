For multiple random variables, the variance becomes a vector, consisting of the variance values of each variable. For example, for a random vector X =[X\u2081, X\u2082], its variance var(X) = [var(X\u2081), var(X\u2082)].", "Calculating var(X\u2081) of a joint distribution of X\u2081 and X\u2082 follows the definition of the variance:", "Like calculating expectation values, we use the marginal distribution of X\u2081, f(x\u2081), in the above integral.", "By Substituting the expression of f(x\u2081) into the above equation, we have:", "Similar, we have the following expression for var(X\u2082):", "For the multivariate case, we need to introduce an extra concept of covariance to measure the dependency between pairs of random variables.", "Similar to the concept of variance, which measures the variation of a single variable, covariance measures how two variables vary together. For random variables X\u2081 and X\u2082, their covariance is defined as:", "If large values of X\u2081 often result in large values of X\u2082 (figure below, left), the product (X\u2081-E[X\u2081])(X\u2082-E[X\u2082]) will tend to be positive. On the other hand, if large values of X\u2081 often lead to small values of X\u2082 (figure below, right), the product (X\u2081-E[X\u2081])(X\u2082-E[X\u2082]) will tend to be negative.

Therefore:", "One downside of using covariance is that its magnitude does not indicate anything regarding the strength of the relationship between X\u2081 and X\u2082, simply because covariance Cov(X\u2081, X\u2082) is not scale-free.", "To address this issue, we need to introduce the correlation coefficient:", "The correlation coefficient may go with other names, such as Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, bivariate correlation, etc. It can be seen as a standardized form of covariance and measures how strong X\u2081 and X\u2082 are linearly correlated.", "The correlation coefficient\u2019s value is bounded by +1 and \u22121. Scatter plots with different correlation strengths are shown below. A positive \u03c1 value indicates the two random variables are positively correlated, and a negative \u03c1 value says the opposite. When \u03c1 reaches +/-1, this means there is a strictly linear relationship between two variables.", "However, mind that among all sorts of relationships, correlation/covariance only measures the linear association. This means that a zero correlation does not necessarily imply two variables are independent. Those two variables can still be associated in some non-linear ways. However, if those two variables are truly independent, their correlation/covariance will be zero.", "When working with multiple random variables, we need a covariance matrix to summarize the covariances of all pairs of variables succinctly.", "For n random variables X\u2081,\u2026, X\u2099, their associated covariance matrix is demonstrated below. It is a n-by-n square matrix, whose (i, j)th entry is the covariance between X\u1d62 and X\u2c7c, i.e., K\u1d62\u2c7c = Cov(X\u1d62, X\u2c7c).", "A covariance matrix is a symmetry matrix, since Cov(X\u1d62, X\u2c7c) = Cov(X\u2c7c, X\u1d62), therefore K\u1d62\u2c7c = K\u2c7c\u1d62. In addition, the diagonal terms of a covariance matrix are the variance of individual random variables, i.e., K\u1d62\u1d62 = Cov(X\u1d62, X\u1d62) = var(X\u1d62).", "This post has covered many practical probability theories applied to multiple random variables: random vector, joint probability density function, marginal and conditional distributions, Bayes\u2019 rule and fundamental Bayesian statistics, independence, expectation, variance, and covariance/correlation.
