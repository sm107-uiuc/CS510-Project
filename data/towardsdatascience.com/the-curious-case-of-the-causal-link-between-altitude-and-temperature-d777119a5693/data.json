I am writing this article in an attempt to make it clear to myself since it is not really straight forward. So, let\u2019s jump right into it.", "Let\u2019s imagine that we want to learn the joint distribution of heights and temperatures. Our dataset comes from Switzerland. In our dataset, we get heights paired with their respective temperatures. And how can we factorize the joint distribution? Well, there are 2 possible ways:", "Yes, it is that simple. But now comes the golden question. Which formulation is actually correct, because each one implies different things. The first one implies that we are able to predict altitude from temperature. I.e. our model learns the connection T->A. The second one takes rather the reverse, A->T. So, given that you\u2019ve had some basic lectures in physics, you would obviously identify right away, that the second formulation makes rather more sense. There is no physical law that states if you change the temperature, that then the height of things changes (modulo volume changes with temperature and pressure change depending on the density).", "Just to satisfy my curiosity (and perhaps yours), how many of you are convinced that the model p(H | T) is going to be absolute garbage?", "Now suppose that you learn your predictive model from temperature to height and you want to apply it to other places, for example, Germany. The argument is that your model will not be able to generalize because the height distribution of Germany is considerably different than the one from Switzerland. I.e., p(A) is different, and it is not caused by different temperature distribution.", "You might think now, but wait\u2026 It doesn\u2019t mean that my model is not going to be able to generalize, the argument is somehow fishy, not sufficient. I would agree. The key thing is the distribution shift of the test data. A well-known fact in statistical learning theory is that the great theoretical results that we have from learning algorithms are based on the iid assumption (identically independently distributed) of the examples. In that case, our true risk(actual error on the whole dataset) can become arbitrarily small based on the number of data points that we use for fitting our model. But if the iid assumption is violated, then when we naively fit our model to the data, it won\u2019t generalize, i.e. it would have large test error.", "This concept of distribution shift is very important, and this is what makes causality interesting for machine learning. By learning the actual causal mechanisms, we can enable our model to be more robust to distribution changes. This is also called out-of-distribution generalization.", "One way of identifying the causal direction is to take a mountain, change its altitude and observe the temperature. If we see that the temperature changes, then obviously the height influences the temperature. Conversely, we can influence the temperature on the top of the mountain and make it hotter or colder and observe altitude. The altitude obviously wouldn\u2019t change. This would be called an intervention, and I am not talking about it in a statistical sense either. This would be your plain-old physical take the mountain in the real world and make it bigger. But obviously we cannot do that! We do not have godly powers. But then, if we cannot do this, how can we identify the causal direction?", "The truth is, this is difficult. And, actually, the two-variable case is very difficult. We can only identify the causal direction if the model and the noise fits certain criteria, otherwise, you can forget about it.", "This kind of reasoning explained to me the gist of causal inference vs. fitting simple statistical models to the data.", "If you want to read more rants by me, you can also follow me on Twitter. ;)", "A more general comparison between statistical and causal inference can be found in this article.", "Your home for data science.
