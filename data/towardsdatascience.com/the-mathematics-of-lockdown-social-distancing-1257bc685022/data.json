Still, the model is able to beautifully quantify the effect of social distancing & lockdown and the role they play in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d. But since I\u2019m not an epidemiologist, the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice.)", "In a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19, India took a drastic step and went down a 21 day lockdown period starting March 25th, 2020. Even China, where the virus originated, did not take such extreme measures and locked down only a few provinces that too at the peak of corona\u2019s spread.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, given the current scenario, I\u2019m all in favor of a total lockdown. But a nationwide lockdown got me intrigued as to how bad could the situation (or maybe the projected situation) possibly be that the government decided to shut 1.3 bn people in their homes for 3 weeks. The thought got me kicking and I started skimming through the web for more information and ultimately found research paper [1] posted on WHO\u2019s website and this very recent study [2] done by ICMR. These researches formed the base for my work in this blog post.", "For this project, I have essentially built a classical SEIR epidemiological model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 in India under various degrees of social distancing measures.", "The blog has been divided into two parts. In the first part, I\u2019ve tried developing a high level intuition behind the projections the model churns out. In part 2, I\u2019ve dived deeper into the mathematics of the analyses as well as talked about how I went about implementing the model.", "The focus of this post is on the variable \u03c1, which ranges from 0 to 1, and is the model\u2019s bid to gauge the degree of social distancing being practiced in the society. \u03c1=0 denotes total lockdown in the community where as \u03c1=1 denotes no social distancing or quarantining at all.", "Also note that, an individual is said to be exposed if he has already contracted the disease but is still in the incubation period (i.e, the person is more or less asymptomatic but is carrying the virus). After the incubation period ends the person enters the infected stage.", "As can be seen in the visualization above, a decrease in \u03c1, and hence increase in severity of social distancing \u2014 a) results in a flatter peak of infected individualsb) delays the time it takes for the curve to peak", "Thus, if strict quarantining & distancing is followed, then there would be a much lower number of infected cases when this peak arrives. In an optimistic scenario, this number would be lower enough such that the Indian Health care system wouldn\u2019t crumble down under the weight of individuals infected during the peak.", "Well, the simulation does show how important a role can a total lockdown play in flattening the peak. But how much flatter are we really talking about. To understand that, let\u2019s take a look at the projected number of infected individuals who might need hospitalization in the near future.", "As can be seen in the graph above, even with a decently optimistic \u03c1 of 0.6 (which potentially could have been the case if voluntary social distancing was being practiced ), India would have~3.5 crore people infected at the peak some 5 months from now. Various scientific articles, along with this report by WHO, says that 20% of those infected require hospitalization and maybe even ICU level care. If we extrapolate the same figures to our simulation, we would have ~70 lakh people needing hospitalization across India during that peak. Just to put things in perspective, India only has about 7 lakh hospital beds and 70,000 ICU beds in total.", "That\u2019s why India needed a drastic measure like a nationwide lockdown so as to lower this \u03c1 as much as possible.", "Needless to say, \u03c1=1 right now would mean we are doomed.", "The SEIR is a compartmental model for modeling how a disease spreads through the population. It\u2019s an acronym for Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered.", "The susceptible population includes everyone who is yet not infected or is disease free. An individual is said to be exposed if he has already contracted the disease but is still in the incubation period (i.e, the person is more or less asymptomatic even though he is carrying the virus). After the incubation period ends the person enters the infected stage. Next, he moves to the final Removed stage where he can no longer be infected. Now, depending upon how dark your mind make-up is (and also what textbook you are reading), this stage could either mean that the individual recovered and is now immune to the disease, or that he succumbed to the illness and hence is out of population or maybe a combination of both the scenarios.", "Next, if N is the total population under consideration and if we can assume that no individuals are being added in the population during the spread of the virus, the equation below should hold true -", "where S is the number of people susceptible to the disease, E is the number of people exposed and R is the number of people who recovered or died.", "For this project, I\u2019ve used N=1.3 bn (population of India) and borrowed the following Indian COVID-19 statistics, as they stood on March 25th, from the website of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and fed them to the model -", "Current I = Number of confirmed (infected) cases: 563Current R= Number of recoveries: 43 + Number of deaths: 10 = 53", "Finally, we have the following set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which together form the basic SEIR model (impact of social distancing excluded):", "Where \u03b2, \u03c3, \u03b3 are the probabilities or rate associated with which a person moves from one stage to other.", "(* a. Reproductive number, Ro=\u03b2/\u03b3b. The ICMR study states Ro to be equal to 1.5 in the most optimistic scenario and 4 in a pessimistic situation. I\u2019ve taken the average of both these numbers to arrive at the value of \u03b2 for this project)", "As a next step, we need to bring into account a variable to capture the effect of social distancing. That\u2019s when we introduce \u03c1 which has been discussed in detail already. All we need to do is replace \u03b2 with \u03c1\u03b2 in the above system of equations and run the simulations for different values of \u03c1.", "Lastly, to solve this modified system of non-linear ODE in python, I made use of scipy library\u2019s odeint function. You can find the code here.", "Hopefully now you would be in a better condition to understand why India needed a lockdown for the next few weeks. May be now you can understand the weight behind PM Modi\u2019s warning to strictly follow the 21-day lockdown or watch the country get pushed back 21 years.", "Hopefully, now you understand the mathematics of lockdown & social distancing!", "It\u2019s really a tough time for the country. The least you can do is stay on your couch, wash your hands and keep safe!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "It\u2019s all about the math!
