These quizzes can be fun, but maybe they left you feeling like you are not a serious scientific professional. Well. Here is a fun in-between for data science learners: a catalog of ML model types that I have anthropomorphized and described as personality types for amusement, which ideally could also help you understand the pros and cons of each one. Sorry, I mean strengths and areas for improvement.", "You have a classic style about you (maybe BuzzFeed said that if you were a font you would be Times New Roman). You are the type of person who teachers like to use as an example, and you probably take a little pride in that. Whenever people at work ask you questions, you excel in your detailed and easy to follow answers, but sometimes you are not correct. You find that people are generally good at reading you and figuring out how you work \u2014 you\u2019re not complicated, but there is beauty in your simplicity.", "Unfortunately, people may tend to mistreat you and not give you the time and attention you deserve. And you, to your part, tend to make lots of assumptions of others.", "You are a self-diagnosed people person. You love connecting others as well as matchmaking, and it gives you joy when you introduce a new person into your social group and they fit right in. You are pretty great at this, but if you are not careful, it will become cumbersome to balance all of your different social cliques. Another one of your strengths is peacemaking \u2014 if there is a conflict you take a democratic approach and allow everyone to have a vote towards what the group should do.", "Sometimes your people-pleasing tendencies can leave you paralyzed: constantly calculating and struggling to reach a good decision. Also, you hate to admit it, but some of your friends would describe you as lazy.", "You were voted homecoming king/queen, you are a high achiever, and/or you pride yourself on always being right. You are popular with a variety of different people, and are often the center of attention at a party. One thing people always admire about you is how flexible you are \u2014 you can adapt to almost any situation quickly and even excel in tough circumstances. You also tend to overshadow your younger siblings.", "Sometimes your friends complain that they do not fully understand you, but in close relationships you are able to explain yourself for the most part. However, your highly complex nature forces you to withdraw from others on occasion, and take lots of time to yourself to recharge, plan, and make good decisions.", "Sometimes your life is a bit of a cluster f***. You move quickly from task to task. Because of your speed, you prefer when requests at work or in the home come to you in easy to understand, standardized format that you can absorb with ease. Like your buddy K Nearest Neighbors, you also love being able to connect friends and place them in fitting social groups. You, however, are even better than he is at this, as you typically need a little less information and you can potentially get better results. Your ultimate strength: being able to make order out of chaos.", "Your ultimate weakness: dealing with very complex individuals.", "My goal with this article is to get the question \u201cIf you were a machine learning model, which would you be?\u201d trending and eventually having it land on one of the many Top __ Data Science Interview Questions lists. Also, if you learned even one useful thing out of this, that would be awesome too.", "It would make my day if you commented which model you think you are below, seriously.", "Your home for data science.
