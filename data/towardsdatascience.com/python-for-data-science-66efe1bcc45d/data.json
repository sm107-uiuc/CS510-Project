Google Trends suggests that the interest in the term \u2018data science\u2019 is on an upward swing since September 2013. The emergence of Data Science programs at all major universities stands testimony to the newfound popularity of the discipline. For the uninitiated, it is imperative to get acquainted with the terms like Data Science and Data Scientists. \u201cData Science\u201d means the scientific study of the creation, validation, and transformation of data to create meaning (definition given by Data Science Association -a non-profit professional association of data scientists). \u201cData Scientist\u201d means a professional who uses scientific methods to liberate and create meaning from raw data.", "Data science can also be considered as an amalgamation of statistics with computer science and technology. As our society became more and more data-driven, and the processing power of computers grew significantly over the years(so as to comprehend large chunks of data), data became the new oil and thereby triggered the unprecedented surge of data science. Nevertheless, the quality of data is as important as the quantity of data for meaningful outcomes via data science.", "Python and data science share a symbiotic relationship (sort of). Over the years Python has become the de-facto programming language for data science. The simplicity and ease of learning Python and the availability of numerous Artificial Intelligence (AI) packages in Python were a major factor for becoming the be-all and end-all of data science. The extensive use of Python in the industry qualified it to be an obvious choice.", "Python programming language was created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands, after the failure to create a new programming language(ABC language) that will weed out BASIC programming language. He was also the Benevolent Dictator For Life(a title given to software development leaders who have the final say) for Python until he chose to step down on 12 July 2018.", "Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.", "You may be intrigued by the name \u2018Python\u2019. Why was the programming language named so? As the implementation of Python began, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\u201d, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python. In his King\u2019s Day Speech, he clearly specifies that his intention was to honor the irreverent comedic genius of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. He also mentions that the first version of Google was written in Python as Larry Page and Sergey Brin believed that Python was the right language to express the original ideas that they had about how to index the web and organize search results.", "Python is developed on the Internet by a community of volunteers who feel passion and ownership.", "Python can be installed by either downloading Anaconda Individual Edition(the recommended way) from here or from the official website Python.org.", "Double click on the downloaded .exe file and follow the instructions.", "The Pythonic way(the adjective used by the Python community for the codes that follow a particular way) is quite a minimalist approach.", "Beautiful is better than ugly.Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.Complex is better than complicated.", "Let\u2019s start with printing \u201cHello World!\u201d and will understand it as we consider doing the same in other popular general-purpose languages like C++ and Java.", "To print \u201cHello World\u201d in Java:", "The printing of the two words \u201cHello World!\u201d can be accomplished in Python by a single line of code. It speaks volumes about the easiness and minimalism of Python.", "Python is simple, powerful, and elegant. Coding in Python mimics the way we speak the English language. Suppose you have to create a program for a school database. Consider the module that involves the deletion of student data. The deletion of records can only be performed by a person who has administrative privileges. In the absence of it, an authentication error must occur. It is also imperative to check whether a student with that particular id exists in the class. In order to perform this operation in Python, you are only required to write a few lines of code as shown below:", "The above lines of code are almost self-explanatory. The code snippet exemplifies the simplicity of Python. For beginners, def is the keyword for defining functions in Python. We will surely be going in great detail into the nitty-gritty of Python programming in the upcoming articles of the Python series.", "Before concluding the introduction into Python programming, it\u2019s indispensable to familiarize yourself with the \u201cZen of Python\u201d by Tim Peters(software developer who created the Timsort hybrid sorting algorithm and who made significant contributions to Python programming language). The \u201cZen of Python\u201d succinctly states the 19 guiding principles to follow while writing computer programs in Python. You can view it by simply running the following command:", "You will then see the \u201cZen of Python\u201d:", "We will dive deep into the various aspects of Python programming language in the upcoming articles of this series. Hope you learned something new about the Python programming language. Happy Coding!!!", "Your home for data science.
