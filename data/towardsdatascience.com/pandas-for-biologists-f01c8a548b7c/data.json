The feeling that their background education has not prepared them for the challenge is common among graduate students and postdocs. The time to learn new computational skills seems to have passed. \u201cThey missed the train\u201d.", "The truth is, learning how to code from scratch can be extremely time-consuming and for most of us working in a highly competitive environment, under an endless pressure to be productive and publish our work, it might feel like a detour from the intellectual endeavor that we have in hands at a given time. We have a lot on our plates. We always have a lot on our plates. However, what most fail to understand is that researchers have no need to become cutting-edge programmers with a keen ability to build web content or mobile apps. A marginal level of coding skills will give most scientists the ability to automate repetitive tasks, manipulate data and images, and increase their resources when it comes to share and present their work. Besides, it is becoming clear that track and manipulate information using only spreadsheets and standard software will become impractical in a near future. Scientists who lack the ability to understand basic code and write their own custom-made scripts to analyze and optimize experiments will struggle to keep the pace. What may seem as challenging compromise today, will most certainly pay off in the long run. Time spent at our laptops can be more valuable than many experiments. Programming expertise will make us better scientists and the answers to our research questions will come faster and more efficiently.", "Perhaps you have missed one train, but there are plenty of other ones to catch. This short read is my attempt to give you a ride on the next one.", "In case you haven\u2019t noticed yet, I am not a data scientist. Actually, I\u2019m the \u2018classic\u2019 experimental biochemist who never wrote a single line of code during the whole undergrad. The motivation to learn how to program came when I was already half-way through my PhD. As my data piled up, I found myself spending hours repeating the same analysis protocols, either to optimize parameters or to feed my models with fresh data. I realized that standard software and spreadsheets were a fragile thing to rely on. As a result, I decided to dive into the programming world to acquire the skills that would allow me to automate the boring parts of my work. This led me to Python, a game changer in my current PhD journey. I\u2019ve became much more time-efficient in any type of data and image analysis, stood out from my peers and increased my career prospects in a variety of data-driven fields.", "Initially, my main struggle was to recognize value in what I was learning. I was investing a lot of my free time and applying too little of that \u2018knowledge\u2019. The learning curve seemed very steep and it felt like I could do all those tasks with a simple Excel sheet. You know that feeling, right? Online platforms often rely on conceptual exercises with no apparent application for life scientists and provide excessive guidance with many instructions. When you decide to write your own code from scratch, you find yourself looking at a blank page wondering how to start. Two things made me overcome these difficulties and jump to the upper part of that learning curve faster: learn by doing and Pandas, a powerful data science library for Python.", "learn-by-doing, essentially means a more hands-on approach. Reading about code is not coding. You need to take the leap and start writing code on your machine. I sought to reproduce what I could do in Excel or OriginLab in Python, e.g manipulate data, plotting, apply statistical tests and fit mathematical models to my experimental data. I had to spend a great amount of time debugging and looking at code from others to understand and fix my errors, but in the end, this was the most productive strategy for me: Figure out how to make something meaningful work, call on the extremely supportive python community (google is your friend!), investigate error messages to fix my problems and learn during the process.", "There are many languages out there, but Python was ideal for me \u2014 open source, extremely intuitive and holding extensive scientific libraries for common scientific problems. Pandas just makes Python even better! Pandas is arguably the most important library in Python to do data science, and a great tool to persuade non-programmers to take a deep dive into coding. Pandas rely on a data structure called DataFrame. This resembles an Excel spreadsheet and includes a variety of built-in functions to manipulate and analyze data with little programming knowledge.", "If you consider yourself a \u2018Jon Snow\u2019 when it comes to code (you know nothing!) the beginning can be quite rage-inducing. You need to interact with the command line, write abstract words on a black screen just to download software and packages, and quickly you feel like you got lost in the Matrix. However, Python offers an alternative to that initial stress (at least for the time being) through Anaconda. Anaconda distribution works as any other software: download and install from the webpage. Anaconda includes not only the last version of python but also many standard libraries used for data science, which otherwise would have to be installed manually from the command line. These packages include numpy and scipy \u2014 used for many scientific computing tasks \u2014 and matplotlib , the most used library for visualizations in Python. In fact pandas is built on top of numpy and works extremely well in combination with scipy and matplotlib. Anaconda comes with other open source platforms, including R studio, and two IDEs (integrated development environments) for python (spyder and jupyther). IDEs are basically editors to write and compile your code. There are many out there, which can be another source of confusion. Nevertheless, jupyter is usually a great starting point for life scientists. They are simpler than many other IDEs and offer a notebook-fashion, where the user can have pieces of code, plots and notes at the same time.", "Below, I provide a short and gentle introduction to pandas using a jupyter notebook. If you have anaconda installed on your machine, you are more than ready to follow along. This guide uses a public well-known breast cancer diagnostic data set. My goal is to illustrate how much you can do with pandas with a limited amount of programming skills and perhaps motivate you to learn more by building from here. The flexibility to work with code on Medium is quite limited, so I\u2019m sharing a github link containing a jupyter notebook with all the examples I show here. Shall we begin?", "Every python script begins with a few import commands where the user sets the libraries/packages they want to work with, in addition to the ones already included by default in the raw language. You can think about them as folders containing different functions and parameters inside. By convention, we import packages and express them in a shorter version of their name to avoid writing so many words along the document. For instance, we import pandas as pd so we don\u2019t have to write pandas every time we want to use the library, only pd. Same goes for np and plt instead of their full names.", "The script below shows how to load the data set by using the pd.read_csv function from pandas. This function reads .txt or .csv files directly from a folder on your machine and displays the data in a format that will remind you of a typical spreadsheet. We attribute the output of the function to a variable (breast_cancer_data) in order to use it along the script.", "Our data set contains 569 samples (patients), categorical data \u2014 diagnosis result \u2014 and numerical data \u2014 31 attributes concerning the tumor shape and size, along with the id of each patient). We are now ready to start exploring and manipulating the data as we intend. The script below shows a few examples of simple operations that can be applied with just a single line of code.", "Note that we are simply checking the output of a given function here, not changing the data permanently. In order to do that, we need to attribute a new variable to the output of each operation. Alternatively, we can also use the parameter inplace = True, which tells pandas that we want to implement the action directly on the original table. To wrap up this first section, we can create a subset of the data using some of the functions above to use on the next section, we\u2019ll call it breast_cancer_data_subset.", "Two useful tools in pandas when you start to explore large data sets are the pd.describe() function, which returns a summary statistics for all numerical columns, and the pd.corr() function, which returns the correlation between all the columns in our data frame. Below you can see how they look like, respectively.", "Note how much information can be retrieved from the data with just two simple lines of code! These functions use only the columns containing numerical data and for that reason, the diagnosis column is not shown. Other simple operations can be applied following a similar pattern. Here are a few more examples.", "Overall, sorting, counting, slicing and basic mathematical operations can be applied effortless. All functions typically contain optional parameters that can give us even more control over their outputs. Detailed information concerning the role of each parameter can be found in the pandas documentation.", "All the operations we made above are possible because pandas is built on top of numpy, the fundamental package for scientific computing. In the same way, pandas also incorporates part of the matplotlib library to create quick data visualizations. To do this, we use the plot() function and set our variables ( x and y ) and the type of plot (kind) as parameters of that function.", "Personally, I rather plot my data using matplotlib library directly, where I have much more control over colors, axes, sizes and shapes. However, for the sake of the argument, I\u2019ll stick with pandas to show you how informative and visually appealing these plots can already be. Actually, there is another data visualization library based on matplotlib called seaborn that works really well with pandas. This is a small detour from the main goal of this post but seaborn is a terrific visualization tool for correlations, better than matplotlib alone to create boxplots and it is extremely user-friendly for beginners. Here\u2019s an example.", "As you can be seen in these examples, seaborn can be extremely helpful as a first sneak peek at the correlation between multiple variables. In addition, it also provides a simple way to plot box plots directly from your data frames using sns.boxplot function. The snippet of code below shows how.", "Much more can be done by combining pandas and seaborn , but once again, this is only a showcase of how much can be done even knowing \u2018too little\u2019.", "To conclude, let me introduce two handy techniques: data filtering using simple conditional arguments and the groupby function, arguably one of the best tools pandas has to offer. Conditionals follow a simple pattern, we define the condition we want to apply to a column or a row (e.g >, < or ==) and we pass that condition in the same way we call for a column. Multiple conditions can be combined using the symbol | ( \u2018or\u2019) and & ( \u2018and\u2019). Here are some examples.", "Finally, the groupby function splits data into groups according to a categorical or numerical label in a given column. Then, mathematical operations can be applied to each one of those groups individually. In our example, the two labels in the diagnosis column (B or M) can be used for this purpose, allowing us to investigate how the data differs inside each category, benign and malign tumors.", "By simply applying the groupby function, we can quickly compare different underlying populations in our data and investigate if the differences between the features are statistically relevant. I find this function so helpful that I could write another post only around it. Maybe in a follow-up post.", "This was just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with pandas in combination with matplotlib and seaborn. Perhaps this post can motivate you to grab one of your own data sets and start experimenting. From here, you can quickly extrapolate to other libraries such scipy, which can be used to fit mathematical models to data and apply statistical tests.", "Of course, this short read does not offer you all the building blocks of the python language. Eventually, you will have to dig deeper to learn about the different data types (strings, lists, arrays and dictionaries) and things like for loops or list comprehensions. However, by aiming to build something meaningful with the language, instead of just solving random tasks online, might give you some extra motivation to keep on track and pick all the pieces along the way. Learning how to program can be a really empowering skill to have, not only to boost your career prospects but to navigate smoothly this technological era.", "Your home for data science.
