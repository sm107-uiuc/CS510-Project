The time when it was a niche topic with only a few active researchers is a distant past. Today, we see top companies such as Google or Twitter heavily investing in this field.", "Surprisingly, a lot of available data can be modelled as graphs. Take online social interactions on Reddit, for example. We can represent each user as a node that is connected to other users. But then how do we analyse this kind of data, or even apply machine learning?", "In graph representation learning, we aim to answer these questions. In this article, we will look at the main concepts and challenges in graph representation learning.", "Let\u2019s start from basics, shall we?", "We define a graph as a set of vertices with connections (edges) between them. There are many types of graphs \u2014 for example, they can be directed, directionless, or acyclic.", "To make graphs useful for any kind of algorithm, we need to convert them into a numerical form. To achieve that, we can use Adjacency, Laplacian, or Degree matrices which provide a convenient matrix representation of graphs. Each vertex and each connection can also have a feature vector that defines its properties.", "A good introduction to graphs can be found in [1]. Once you are fairly confident with basics, it\u2019s good to learn about more advanced concepts such as graph isomorphism and graph colouring.", "The main idea behind feature extraction for graphs is to represent information about local and global graph structure in a more convenient, vector-like format. We are equally interested in extracting information about the properties of single vertices as well as in the connectivity between them.", "Features extracted from graphs can be divided into three types: node level, graph level and neighbourhood overlap features.", "For node level features, we aim to generate a feature vector for each vertex. Some of the most popular feature extraction methods are node degree, centrality methods, or clustering coefficients. To compute these features we can use information from the nearest neighbours of the vertex, or from more distant, K-hop neighbourhood.", "We can also take a more general approach and create a feature for the whole graph. It is known as graph level features. It can be done with basic features such as Adjacency matrix but also with more complicated iterative approaches such as Weisfeiler-Lehman, or Graphlet kernels.", "The last type of feature extraction for graphs are neighbourhood overlap features. They are specifically designed for extracting information about the connectivity between nodes. They can be further subdivided into local and global methods. The former describes the similarity of the neighbourhood between two nodes and the latter describes whether certain nodes belong to the same community (i.e. a group of densely clustered nodes) within a graph.", "You can find an in-depth explanation of feature extraction techniques in this article.", "The main issue of using machine learning on graphs is that the nodes are interconnected with each other. This breaks the assumption of independent datapoints which forces us to use more elaborate feature extraction techniques or new machine learning models that can handle this problem.", "Prediction tasks are also defined much differently on graphs. We can divide it into 4 main types: node classification, link prediction, learning over the whole graph, and community detection.", "Node classification aims to predict properties of vertices within the graph. Link prediction is also quite similar but it predicts properties of the link (connection) between two vertices. These tasks are referred to as semi-supervised learning because the graph will contain both training and test data at the same time.", "Learning over the whole graph is the most intuitive approach. We take a whole graph as input and generate a prediction based on it. It closely resembles standard machine learning regression and classification tasks.", "Lastly, for the community detection, we aim to identify dense clusters of vertices within the graph.", "If you would like to learn more about the prediction tasks on graphs, have a look here.", "To redefine neural networks on graphs, we had to come up with completely new deep learning architectures [2].", "The simplest architecture is Message Passing Neural Network. Here, an equivalent of the forward pass is an iterative aggregation of features from the vertex neighbourhood. Each aggregation operation is considered as a single layer. After n iterations, we use a final aggregation operation to extract all information as a single vector/matrix.", "We can also define Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on graphs. They can be divided into a spatial and spectral approach. The spatial approach is the most intuitive one: we define a kernel to perform the convolutions on graphs, similarly as in CNNs. The spectral approach is slightly more complicated: we consider a graph in a Fourier domain and focus on processing signals that propagate through the graph.", "The aim of these models is to create new graphs with desired properties. Here, we want an output of our model to be a graph [2]. But why would we need to generate graphs?", "Firstly, we can use these graphs as benchmark data for machine learning models [2]. For example, if we want to detect communities, we can create a generative graph model that can create graphs that have communities. By defining these models, we can also tell how likely it is to generate a specific instance of the graph.", "The Erdos-Renyi model is a good example. It is a very simple model that assigns a probability of a connection between two arbitrary nodes as r. With this parameter, we control how densely connected is the generated graph.", "More sophisticated models include stochastic block models, preferential attachment, and different variational autoencoder approaches. A great explanation of these models can be found in [2] (Part III \u2014 Generative Graph Models).", "Machine learning on graphs is not simple. We\u2019ve seen that most of the standard machine learning methods have to be redefined into the graph domain. Feature extraction, prediction tasks on graphs are very different than for normal machine learning problems. We hope that by creating new techniques that work with graph data we can fully leverage information within a graph and create better performing models.", "I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. In my spare time, you can find me fiddling with data or debugging my deep learning model (I swear it worked!). I also like hiking :)", "Here are my other social media profiles, if you want to stay in touch with my latest articles and other useful content:", "[1] Graph Theory by Robin J.
