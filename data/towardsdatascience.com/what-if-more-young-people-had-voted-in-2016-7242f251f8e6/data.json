This leads to speculation that young people could alter the outcome of American elections just by voting in larger numbers. With that in mind, I set out to see if this would actually have been the case in 2016. Specifically, could 18\u201324 year olds have changed the outcome of the election if more of them had voted?", "As we all know, the United States does not use the popular vote for presidential elections, so national poll results alone won\u2019t necessarily give a good idea of how the outcome could change. The electoral college means that both geographical distribution of the young voters and their regional political preferences are relevant, and both are ignored by national data. Thus I decided to find out how vote totals would change state by state if more young people voted.", "Using state by state participation rates I was able to calculate the number of 18\u201324 year olds who did not vote in each state. Then, using exit polling data for each state, I calculated how many new votes there would be for each candidate in each state. The result showed six states would have been won by Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. This would have given Clinton 107 more electoral votes and a convincing 339\u2013199 electoral college victory.", "Of course, expecting every 18\u201324 year old to vote is highly unrealistic \u2014 no demographic has turnout of even 90%, let alone 100%. Perhaps a better question to ask would be \u2014 what would have happened if 18\u201324-year-olds voted at the same rate as those 65 and older?", "While the result is not quite as dramatic, only changing the result in two states, it is enough to change the outcome of the election. In this scenario Florida and Michigan would have been won by Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump. With 45 new electoral votes, Hillary would have had a 277\u2013261 electoral college victory.", "We can see that if every 18\u201324-year-old voted, Hillary Clinton would have won easily. Perhaps that should not surprise us, as no demographic participates at 100%. The more interesting conclusion is that voters 18 to 24 years old could have changed the result of the election by voting at the same rate as voters 65 and older, a much more realistic turnout.", "This final plot shows the margins of victory in each of the scenarios described above, along with the actual 2016 electoral college result.", "For this analysis, I assembled exit poll data, along with voter participation rates and population statistics, all broken down by age. The exit poll data was taken from Edison Research, a firm which does exit polling for a media consortium including ABC, The Associated Press, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. Voter participation rates and population data were taken from the US Census. Data manipulation and plotting was done using Pandas and Geopandas in python. My notebook and datasets can be found on Github here.", "Edison collected demographic voting data for 29 states, as well as national demographic voting preferences. For three states they collected voting data about 18\u201329-year-olds but not 18\u201324-year-olds. In theses states I used the 18\u201329-year-old data. For the remaining 21 states, I used the national 18\u201324-year-old voting preferences in place of state level data. However, it is worth noting that none of these states without state level 18\u201324-year-old exit polling was close \u2014 the margins of victory range from 12% (Delaware, won by Clinton) to 91%, with an average margin of victory of 29%. Also, none of these states changed winners when I added the additional young voters, so using national data here should not have hurt the results.", "The big assumption in this analysis is that the exit polling data is accurate, as representative sampling is difficult to achieve in an exit polling situation. If those who are willing to answer an exit poll and those who don\u2019t want to answer the poll voted differently, the results could be biased. Additionally, it is not clear what statistical methods Edison used, so it is impossible to know what assumptions they have made. Luckily, the census data is very thorough, and contains great voter participation and demographic data for all 50 states. Also, it has been shown that if voter turnout information is wrong, then it tends to overestimate voting, so if anything this analysis underestimates the potential inluence of young voters.", "Your home for data science.
