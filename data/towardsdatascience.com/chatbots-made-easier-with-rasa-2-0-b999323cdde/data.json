Tensorflow requires Numpy <0.19, while Rasa requires 0.19.4.", "If you try running Rasa, you will run into a runtime error.", "To solve that, just downgrade your Numpy:", "Let\u2019s understand some basic concepts in Rasa.", "What is the user intending to ask about?", "What are the important pieces of information in the user\u2019s query?", "What is the possible way the conversation can go?", "What action should the bot take upon a specific request?", "The first thing to do is:", "You will then be prompted to create a sample Rasa project in the current folder.", "This is what the sample project will look like. The models file is created once we train the model.", "This is what the file looks like. It is quite intuitive to start with.", "In order to create your own custom chatbot, you will have to code some intents into it. If you are making a chatbot for a city, intents would be tourist destinations, restaurants, etc.", "Make sure intent names aren\u2019t duplicated.", "To put a new intent, we just have to follow suit of any of the intents above. The intent tells us the name of the intent. The examples tell us what the language regarding this intent be like. Make sure to at least give 2 examples.", "In order to create your own custom actions, this example can be followed.", "You will have to create a child class of Action and it will have two functions, name and run. The function name will be returning the action name that will be used by the chatbot. The function run will hold the functionality performed by your action such as computing some numbers, fetching data from the Internet, etc. Using dispatcher.utter_message, you can send a reply through the chatbot such as the answer to the computation.", "Make sure the name of any two actions don\u2019t clash.", "The domain.yml contains the domain knowledge of the chatbot i.e. the information it needs to operate (what will people ask and what it has to reply or do?).", "In case, you want to use actions in your chatbot, then, you also need to add the actions section to this file. If not, skip this part.", "Under the actions section, put the name of the actions you have created in the previous step.", "Under the intents section, you have to put in your custom intents.", "The next step would be to create utterances under the responses section i.e. the answers your chatbot will be giving to the user when a question regarding the intent is asked.", "Make sure response names are not duplicated.", "Give unique response names and under them, give an answer you would like to give when asked a question about a certain intent.", "This is the place where we stitch everything together.", "Under the stories section are the various ways, a conversation can flow between the user and the chatbot. For your chatbot, you put your stories here.", "Following the suit of the above examples, you will first put a story name and the steps in it. You can put in the name of utterances and actions in the action part of the story.", "So, your intents go into the intent section of a story while your actions and utterances go into the action part of the story.", "Now, you have put all the information about your custom chatbot in the various files. Let\u2019s train your chatbot.", "Simply, type the above command and let the magic happen!", "Now, you can integrate this chatbot into your own website, Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Twilio, Microsoft Bot Framework, Cisco Webex Teams, RocketChat, Mattermost, and Google Hangouts Chat. You can also connect the chatbot to any other platform but you would have to create your own custom connector.", "For now, let\u2019s test it on localhost.", "Note: If you have used actions in your chatbot, then, you need to uncomment the action_endpoint section in endpoints.yml. Then, open a separate terminal. Make sure you are in the Rasa folder. Then, you have to run rasa run actions", "Now, comes the moment of truth.", "There are two ways to run Rasa: in the shell and on the localhost.", "For running Rasa inside the shell, just type the command in a terminal opened in the Rasa folder:", "This command will start the Rasa server and you will get to talk to the chatbot right in the terminal.", "The other way is to run Rasa on the localhost server. For that, just run the following command from a terminal opened in the Rasa folder:", "This would run Rasa on your local system and expose a REST endpoint at 5000 port in the localhost.", "If you are running the rasa shell command, then you can directly interact with the chatbot in the terminal. Like this:", "The bot replies \u2018Hey! How are you?\u2019 to my \u2018hi\u2019.", "In order to communicate with the REST endpoint exposed by the Rasa server, you can use cURL commands (for Linux-lovers) or Postman. I prefer Postman because of its ease-of-use.", "You have to make a POST request to the URL:", "In the Body of the request, select the raw option in Postman.", "In JSON format, you have to specify two keys: sender and message.", "Put a dummy value in the sender and the message will be your query to the chatbot.", "You will be returned a JSON with keys: recipient_id and text. text will have the reply of the chatbot to your query and recipient_id will be the same as the sender key you sent in the request.", "We understood how using creating a chatbot is easy using Rasa. We understood the basic concepts in Rasa framework i.e. intent, entity, action, and story. We understood what are the steps to create a custom chatbot suited to our own needs.
