A god or a pet? A hammer or a nail? Do we really need more metaphors to describe it? Nowadays, A.I dictates what information is presented to us on social media, which ads we see, and what prices we\u2019re offered both on and offline. An algorithm can technically write and analyse books, beat humans at about every game conceivable, make movies, compose classical songs and help magicians perform better tricks. Beyond the arts, it also has the potential to encourage better decision-making, make medical diagnoses, and even solve some of humanity\u2019s most pressing challenges. It\u2019s intertwining with criminal justice, retail, education, recruiting, healthcare, banking, farming, transportation, warfare, insurance, media\u2026 the list goes on.", "Yet, we\u2019re so often busy discussing the ins and outs of whether A.I CAN do something, that we seldom ask if we SHOULD design it at all.", "This is where ethic comes in. Companies and governments alike have come to realise that statistics on steroids are capable of great harm, and are studying various ways to deal with potential fallout without impacting their bottom line or strategic geopolitical advantage. They have come up with dozens of \u201cprinciples\u201d, each more unenforceable than the next, failing to even agree on a basic framework. Discussing war, automation, mass surveillance, authoritarianism is paramount; but these discussions cannot take place before key ethical principals and red lines are agreed to.", "As such, below is a \u201cquick\u201d guide to the discussions surrounding A.I and ethics. It aims to help democratise conversations: we do not necessarily need smarter people at the table (and anything I write will not be news to an expert), but we DO need a bigger table. Or more tables. Or more seats. Or some sort of a video-conference solution.", "Before we dive into the contemporary discussion about ethics, we first need to understand what ethic is.

You see, even if we separate normative ethics (the study of ethical action) from its lamer cousins meta-ethics and applied ethics, there\u2019s still no one definition of what is good/bad and/or wrong/right. Indeed, what is good may be wrong, and what is bad may be right.", "Here are the schools of thoughts to know about in order to best understand why current propositions on A.I ethics have little to do with moral principles :", "Lesson 1: if a company or government tells you about its ethical principles, it is your duty to dig and ask which ethical branch they\u2019re basing these principles on. Much information can be found in such definitions.", "It\u2019s important to ask this because as we see below, institutions like to use the word ethic without actually ever going near anything resembling a moral principle (please refer to the title of this article for a regular sanity check). The good news, however, is that there is literally no correlation between knowing a lot about ethics and behaving ethically.", "Companies exist to reward shareholders. At least, that\u2019s the business philosophy that has been espoused for the past 50 years. As such, companies have no incentive to do either \u201cright\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, unless their profits are at risk. All that matters to them, technically, is that customers see them as doing good/right. Ethics theatre is the idea that companies will do all they can to APPEAR to be doing their best to behave ethically, without doing so, in order to prevent consumer backlash. A perfect way to do this is by announcing grand, non-binding principles and rules in no way linked to actual ethics, pointing to them should any challenge arise.", "Below are such principles, as defined by a few large A.I companies. This is in no way exhaustive (yet is exhausting), but provides an insight into corporation-sponsored ethics-washing. These rules generally fall into 4 categories.", "\u201cDesignate a lead AI ethics official\u201d (IBM), \u201cAI designers and developers are responsible for considering AI design, development, decision processes, and outcomes\u201d (IBM), \u201cBe accountable to people\u201d (Google); \u201cAI systems should have algorithmic accountability\u201d (Microsoft).", "Why it\u2019s B-S: firstly, and like much of the points below, none of this is about ethics per se, even as some of the papers actually have the word itself in their title. Secondly, nowhere is it written that executives should be accountable to the law of the land, giving them free reign to do whatever the hell they want. Indeed, few laws exist to reign in A.I, but this is literally why we have ethics; nowhere is it stated by which standards the companies will be held accountable or responsible for. Deontology? Consequentialism? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this point.", "\u201cDon\u2019t hide your AI\u201d (IBM), \u201cExplain your AI\u201d (IBM), \u201cAI should be designed for humans to easily perceive, detect, and understand its decision process\u201d (IBM), \u201cAI systems should be understandable\u201d (Microsoft).", "Why it\u2019s B-S: I won\u2019t go into much detail here because this is more technical than theoretical (here\u2019s a quick guide), but A.I is a black box by its very nature. In order to have full transparency, companies would have to make parts of their code available, something that has been discussed but is (obviously) fiercely opposed. The other solution comes from the GDPR\u2019s \u201cright to explanation\u201d, and concentrates on input rather than output. Said right mandates that users be able to demand the data behind the algorithmic decisions made for them. This is a great idea, but is not implemented anywhere outside of Europe.", "\u201cTest your AI for bias\u201d (IBM), \u201cAI must be designed to minimize bias and promote inclusive representation\u201d(IBM); \u201cAvoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias\u201d (Google), \u201cAI systems should treat all people fairly\u201d (Microsoft).", "Why it\u2019s B-S: A system created to find patterns in data might find the wrong patterns. That is the simplest definition of A.I bias. Such a buzzword helps companies shy away from hard topics, such as sexism, racism or ageism.

This is odd, because \u201cdo no evil\u201d, the company\u2019s longtime slogan, is technically deontology. Such a dichotomy highlights a glaring carelessness: one of the world\u2019s largest company is defining A.I principles that may have a far reach in society while simultaneously going against its internal culture. This sounds like over-analysis until you realise that there have been many internal employee revolts within Google over the past few months for this very reason.", "You may have noted that only three companies are named above (Google, IBM, Microsoft). It\u2019s because the other major A.I companies have yet to produce anything worthy of being picked apart, choosing instead to invest in think-tanks that will ultimately influence governments. This point highlights a major flaw common to all principles: none offer that companies subject themselves to enforceable rules. Why then, do companies bother with ethics theater? The first reason, as explained above, is indeed to influence governments and steer the conversation in the \u201cright\u201d direction (see below the similarities in standards between company and government priorities). Secondly, it\u2019s good to be seen as being ethical by customers and employees, so as to avoid any boycotts. Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, there is big money to be made in setting a standard: Patents x universal use = $$$.", "Lesson 2: Companies know very little about ethics, and have no incentives to take a stand on what is good or right. Corporate ethics is an oxymoron.", "As such, governments need to step up, as corporations are unlikely to forego profit for the sake of societal good.", "There are many government-published white papers out there, but they are either vague as all hell, or shamefully incomplete. Furthermore, many see A.I through the lens of economic and geopolitical competition. One notable exception is the clear emphasis on ethics and responsibility in the EU\u2019s A.I strategy and vision, especially relative to the US and China (both morally discredited to the bone). In order to get an overall look at what countries believe A.I ethics should be, I\u2019ve put their principles into 7 categories, most of which closely resemble those highlighted by the above analysis of corporations.", "Note that this is merely a (relevant) oversimplification of thousands of pages written by people much smarter and more informed than myself.

I mention courage because this is what is missing in the current A.I discourse.

This is particularly true when it comes to A.I; not because people are forcing algorithms to be bad, but because our actions may create a world within which bad behaviours have been enshrined in algorithms, forcing oneself to adopt said behaviours or suffer as a consequence (ex: a woman removing gendered words from her CV) (you may need a primer on machine learning if this confuses you). Tocqueville referred to this as the Tyranny of the Majority: a decision \u201cwhich bases its claim to rule upon numbers, not upon rightness or excellence\u201d. Under the Principle of Rationality, key golden rules would be enforced within all A.I companies through public consultation and technical consulting, ensuring that even if people lose their mind, algorithms enshrining that madness are not built. May I recommend starting with this little-known piece of deontological history", "Let\u2019s assume that the principle above is applied worldwide (ha!). How can companies deal with competing fundamental rights when creating an algorithm? For example, can we forego article 9 and 12 to better enforce article 5? Can we produce an A.I that would scour communication channels in order to find potential criminal activity? These questions are the very reason why we need an ethical stand, which would help develop a stable rank of values, ethics and rights, wherein some would stand above others. Take the infamous Trolley Problem, for example, and apply it to autonomous cars. Given the choice, should an autonomous car prioritise saving two pedestrians over a passenger? What if the passenger is a head of state? What if the pedestrians are criminals? Choosing one school of thought, as hard as this may be, would help create algorithms in line with our beliefs (team Deontology FTW).", "The above example is not random: the largest study on moral preference ever was started in 2014, encouraging users all over the world to respond to a number of variations of the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d. The results, though expected, are clear: different cultures believe in different things when it comes to ethics. Japan and China, for example, are less likely to harm the elderly. Poorer countries are more tolerant towards law-benders. Individualistic countries generally prefer to spare more lives. Ethic is dynamic, but coding is static. This is why no one algorithm should ever be created to make decisions for more than one population. The way I see it, at least three sets based on different worldviews should be made: West, East and South.", "Put simply, if I get into a Chinese autonomous car, I\u2019d like to be able to choose a Western standard in case of an accident.", "This principle may appear blasphemous for many free-market proponents, raised as they are in countries where tobacco groups do not cause cancer, distilleries do not cause alcoholism, guns do not cause school shootings and drug companies do not cause overdoses.
