of numbers.

Boom: behold the \u201caverage\u201d, right?", "Contrary to popular belief, average isn\u2019t actually a thing, mathematically speaking. Meaning: there is no mathematical operation properly called the \u201caverage\u201d. What we usually mean by average is \u201carithmetic mean\u201d, the well-known operation described above. We call this \u201caverage\u201d because we expect it to conform to the colloquial definition of \u201caverage\u201d: a typical, \u2018normal\u2019 or middle value. Often we\u2019re correct, but less often than we think.", "The arithmetic mean is just one among many ways of arriving at an \u201caverage\u201d value. More technically, these are known as \u201csummary statistics\u201d, \u201cmeasures of central tendency\u201d or \u201cmeasures of location\u201d.", "Probably the 2nd most famous summary statistic is the median, the literal middle value of a dataset (which, as such, is often more \u201caverage\u201d than the mean). I won\u2019t discuss this here, but suffice to say that the arithmetic mean is overused in many cases when the median is more appropriate. Further reading here, here & here (last one overlaps a bit with the rest of this article, and is very good).", "This article will focus on two lesser known measures: the geometric & harmonic means.", "Part I develops a conceptual, intuitive & practical understanding of how they work & when to use them.", "Part II is a separate post & gets a bit deeper & more technical, demonstrating their respective dynamics with R code, real & simulated data & plots.", "The arithmetic mean is just 1 of 3 \u2018Pythagorean Means\u2019 (named after Pythagoras & his ilk, who studied their proportions). As foretold, the geometric & harmonic means round out the trio.", "To understand the basics of how they function, let\u2019s work forward from the familiar arithmetic mean.", "The arithmetic mean is appropriately named: we find it by adding all of the numbers in the dataset, then dividing by however many numbers are in the dataset (in order to bring the sum back down to the scale of the original numbers).", "Notice, what we are essentially saying here is: if every number in our dataset was the same number, what number would it have to be in order to have the same sum as our actual dataset?", "But there\u2019s nothing particularly special about addition. It\u2019s just one rather simple mathematical operation. The arithmetic mean works well to produce an \u201caverage\u201d number of a dataset when there is an additive relationship between the numbers. Such a relationship is often called \u201clinear\u201d, because when graphed in ascending or descending order the numbers tend fall on or around a straight line. A simple idealized example would be a dataset where each number is produced by adding 3 to the previous number:", "The arithmetic mean thus gives us a perfectly reasonable middle value:", "But not all datasets are best described by this relationship. Some have a multiplicative or exponential relationship, for instance if we multiplied each consecutive number by 3 rather than adding by 3 as we did above:", "This produces what is known as a geometric series (hint hint).

In fact it\u2019s more than 5x the median (middle number), which is 27.", "This skew is more apparent when the data is plotted on a flat number line:", "Since the relationship is multiplicative, to find the geometric mean we multiply rather than add all the numbers. Then to rescale the product back down to the range of the dataset, we have to take the root, rather than simply dividing. You remember the square root: the number that needs to be squared to arrive at our number of interest.", "This is the same idea, but rather than raising to the second power (aka \u2018squaring\u2019), we need to find the number that would be raised to the 7th power to produce our product, because there are 7 numbers in our dataset, which we multiplied together. This is generally known as the nth root, where n is the size of the dataset. Thus, we need to find the 7th root.", "Notice, what we are saying here is: if every number in our dataset was the same number, what number would it have to be in order to have the same multiplicative product as our actual dataset?", "So, the geometric mean of our dataset is:", "In this case, our geometric mean very much resembles the middle value of our dataset. In fact, it is equivalent to the median.", "Note: the geometric mean will not always equal the median, only in cases where there is an exact consistent multiplicative relationship between all numbers (e.g. multiplying each previous number by 3, as we did). Real world datasets rarely contain such exact relationships, but for those that approximate this sort of multiplicative relationship, the geometric mean will give a closer \u2018middle number\u2019 than the arithmetic mean.", "It turns out that there are many practical uses for the geometric mean, as multiplicative-ish relationships abound in the real world.", "Assume we have $100,000 that accrues a varying rate of interest each year for 5 years:", "We\u2019d like to take a shortcut to find our average annual interest rate, & thus our total amount of money after 5 years, so we try to \u201caverage\u201d these rates:", "Then we insert this average % into a compound interest formula:", "Just to be sure we\u2019re not fooling ourselves, let\u2019s do this the long way & compare results:", "What happened?

This has the added benefit of avoiding negative numbers even when there is a negative rate, which the geometric mean equation can\u2019t handle [it also can\u2019t handle 0s]. The arithmetic mean doesn\u2019t have this issue. It\u2019s the same whether we use the interest rates themselves or 1 + interest rate as input [then subtract 1 from the result], because it is additive rather than multiplicative. But the geometric mean will be different, and wrong, if we don\u2019t add 1.)", "Plugging the geometric mean of the interest rates into our compound interest formula:", "We used the right mean for the right job & got the right result.", "What else is the geometric mean good for?", "A fancy feature of the geometric mean is that you can actually average across numbers on completely different scales.", "For instance, we want to compare online ratings for two coffeeshops using two different sources. The problem is that source 1 uses a 5-star scale & source 2 uses a 100-point scale:", "Coffeeshop Bsource 1 rating: 3source 2 rating: 75", "If we naively take the arithmetic mean of raw ratings for each coffeeshop:", "We\u2019d conclude that Coffeeshop B was the winner.", "If we were a bit more number-savvy, we\u2019d know that we have to normalize our values onto the same scale before averaging them with the arithmetic mean, to get an accurate result. So we multiply the source 1 ratings by 20 to bring them from a 5-star scale to the 100-point scale of source 2:", "So we find that Coffeeshop A is the true winner, contrary to the naive application of arithmetic mean above.", "The geometric mean, however, allows us to reach the same conclusion without having to fuss over the scale or units of measure:", "The arithmetic mean is dominated by numbers on the larger scale, which makes us think Coffeeshop B is the higher rated shop. This is because the arithmetic mean expects an additive relationship between numbers & doesn\u2019t account for scales & proportions. Hence the need to bring numbers onto the same scale before applying the arithmetic mean.", "The geometric mean, on the other hand, can handle varying proportions with ease, due to it\u2019s multiplicative nature. This is a tremendously useful property, but notice what we lose: We no longer have any interpretable scale at all. The geometric mean is effectively unitless in such situations.", "I.e. the geometric means above are not 17.5 'out of' 100 points nor 15 'out of' 5 stars. They are just unitless numbers, in relative proportion to each other. (Technically, their scale is the geometric mean of the original scales, 5 & 100, which is 22.361). This can be a problem if we actually want to interpret the results relative to some scale that is meaningful to us, such as the original 5 or 100-point systems. But if we just want to know the relationship between ratings of the two coffeeshops, we\u2019re good to go.", "UPDATE 7/14/18: As pointed out by Mladen Ferne\u017eir, there is no guarantee that the geometric mean will always preserve the ordering of the arithmetic mean on scaled or normalized values, much less be proportionate to it, as I originally indicated. Rather, it is simply a different way to summarize the relationship between different sets of numbers (albeit one that will often produce more \u2018credible\u2019 summaries of values on different scales). So again, care & critical thought are necessary to its application.", "As with most things in life, there are few ironclad rules for applying the geometric mean (outside of compound interest & such things).

(e.g. the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5). For numbers that are already fractions, this means that you can simply \u201cflip\u201d the numerator & denominator: reciprocal of 4/5 = 5/4. This is true because 1 divided by a fraction yields that fraction\u2019s reciprocal, e.g. 1 \u00f7 (4/5) = 5/4.", "Another way to think about reciprocals is: two numbers that equal 1 when multiplied together. So when finding the reciprocal of a number n, we are simply asking: what number must we multiply with n in order to get 1. (This is why the reciprocal is also sometimes called the multiplicative inverse.)", "So then, the harmonic mean can be described in words as: the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the dataset.", "Thats a lot of reciprocal flips there, but it\u2019s actually just a few simple steps:", "1. Take the reciprocal of all numbers in the dataset 2. Find the arithmetic mean of those reciprocals 3. Take the reciprocal of that number", "In math notation, this looks like:", "A simple example from wikipedia: the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4 is 2:", "Notice, what we are saying here is: if the reciprocal of every number in our dataset was the same number, what number would it have to be in order to have the same reciprocal sum as our actual dataset?", "(Note: due to the fact that 0 has no reciprocal (nothing can be multiplied by 0 to = 1), the harmonic mean also cannot handle datasets containing 0\u2019s, similar to the geometric mean.)", "So that\u2019s how the plumbing works. But what is it good for?", "To answer this, we have to answer: what are reciprocals good for?", "Since reciprocals, like all division, are just multiplication in disguise (which is just addition in disguise), we realize: reciprocals help us more easily divide by fractions.", "For instance, what is 5 \u00f7 3/7? If you remember elementary school maths, you\u2019ll probably just multiply 5 by 7/3 (the reciprocal of 3/7) to solve this:", "But an equivalent method would be to scale the numbers 5 & 3/7 to a common denominator, then divide in the normal way:", "So again, similar to using the geometric mean as a counterpart to the arithmetic mean for multiplicative or nonlinear relationships (see above), the harmonic mean helps us find multiplicative / divisory relationships between fractions without worrying over common denominators.", "As such, the harmonic mean naturally accommodates another layer of multiplication / division over the geometric mean. Thus it is helpful when dealing with datasets of rates or ratios (i.e. fractions) over different lengths or periods.", "SIDEBAR: (You might be thinking: \u201cwait, I thought the geometric mean was used for averaging interest rates & ratios on different scales!\u201d And you would be correct. You also wouldn\u2019t be the first to be confused by this. I myself set out to write this piece to clarify my own thinking & understanding here. So bear with me, I hope to make this clearer with the following example & recap all these differences in the conclusion of this article below.)", "The canonical example of using harmonic means in the real world involves traveling over physical space at different rates, i.e. speeds:", "Consider a trip to the grocery store & back:", "What was your average speed across this entire trip\u2019s duration?", "Again, we might naively apply the arithmetic mean to 30 mph & 10 mph, and proudly declare \u201c20 mph!\u201d", "But consider again: because you travelled faster in one direction, you covered those 5 miles quicker & spent less time overall traveling at that speed, so your average rate of travel across your entire trip\u2019s duration is not the middle point between 30 mph & 10 mph, it should be closer to 10 mph because you spent longer traveling at that speed.", "In order to apply the arithmetic mean correctly here, we\u2019d have to determine the amount of time spent traveling at each rate, then weight our arithmetic mean calculation appropriately:", "So we see that our true average rate of travel was 15 mph, which is 5 mph (or 25%) lower than our naive declaration of 20 mph using an unweighted arithmetic mean.", "You can probably guess where this is headed\u2026", "Let\u2019s try it again using the harmonic mean.", "Our true average rate of travel, automagically adjusted for time spent traveling in each direction = 15 mph!", "Like the case of compound interest and the geometric mean, this is an example of a precise, objectively correct application of the harmonic mean. But again, things aren\u2019t always so clear. There are other precise, mathematically justifiable applications in physics, finance, hydrology & even (by convention) in baseball statistics. More germane to data science: it is often applied to precision & recall in the evaluation of machine learning models.", "But more often than this, it\u2019s a judgement call, dependent on a nimble understanding of your data & the task at hand.", "I\u2019ll try to clarify & summarize the finer points below.", "To recap & make explicit what we\u2019ve already demonstrated:", "1.
