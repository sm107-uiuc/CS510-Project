The convolutional neural network is one such example.", "By converting non-image data, or even sequential data, into an image, convolutional neural networks can utilize their special properties of being computationally efficient and locally focused. Furthermore, it is able to leverage the unique insights and nonlinearities of unsupervised learning.", "Study into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has risen dramatically in recent years as the computing power and data is being increasingly made available. CNNs, however, are exclusively used for image data \u2014 and why not? They were designed for such a purpose.", "While they\u2019re not perfect (in fact, far from it), CNNs have been extensively studied, such that they exist in wide shape and form.", "Specifically, it\u2019s important to note that CNNs operate on images, which we can loosely define as a collection of objects or entities in spatial relation to each other. A CNN assumes that one entity can be said to be in one direction of another. Through convolutions \u2014 which can be thought of as \u2018smoothing\u2019 \u2014 local (smaller regions of the image) information is preserved and progressively generalized.", "On the other hand, standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) often used to deal with certain types of data, like tabular data, and even many breeds of natural language models, make no such image-based assumptions; the data is viewed all at once. Even RNNs and LSTMs view text in only one direction. What would it be like if text \u2014 or any conventionally non-image data, for that matter \u2014 were to be projected onto an image?", "To answer this question, we need to think of structural insights CNNs can bring to classification:", "How can these advantages of CNNs be applied to non-image data?", "Sharma et al introduce a concept, DeepInsight, which is a pipeline to utilize the power of CNNs on non-image data. It\u2019s relatively straightforward:", "After an image has been produced, the image is passed into a network with a unique nonlinear topology (meaning that it is not sequential, but has copying and concatenations \u2014 for something similar, see the Siamese network). These two separate branches each have different filter sizes; these serve to observe data \u2018neighborhoods\u2019 of different sizes.", "Other than this architectural change, however, the cell-based structure reminiscent of other popular convolutional architectures like Inception remains. In the paper, the model parameters were optimized with Bayesian optimization.", "The idea of using the results of a dimensionality reduction, even one designed specifically for visualization like t-SNE, is interesting. It does work for the network in finding suitable visualizations of distances between each point.", "Critical to the pipeline is the choice of dimensionality reduction algorithm. Beyond being nonlinear, kernel PCA and t-SNE are both locality-based (often referred to as neighborhood-based as well) in that they seek not to preserve the \u2018global structure\u2019, like PCA does, but to preserve the relationships between points close to each other.", "For instance, imagine lightly folded piece of paper; a global dimensionality reduction approach would keep the bent structure, whereas a local approach would be comfortable \u2018unfolding it\u2019, as each section of the paper is still close to sections of paper directly adjacent to it. This has the nice effect of a) being pleasant to look at and b) simplifying complex multidimensional structures cleanly and effectively.", "Sometimes, these locality-based dimensionality reduction algorithms can even extract information about complex clusters, which can be used as information for the network. If this information were not provided, one would be counting on the model to find it for itself, which would either take a significant amount of training time or be infeasible altogether.", "Combined with the locality-based nature of image-processing CNNs, the DeepInsight pipeline is characterized by its focus on neighborhoods and not a global structure. This can be helpful in scenarios where consulting with the entire set of inputs is not necessary and can cause unnecessary overfitting. Instead, the power of unsupervised learning is leveraged, and the model learns for itself how to interpret these insights.", "Despite the seemingly daunting nature of this task, it is generally more practical for a model to successfully understand the knowledge presented by the dimensionality reduction than for it to learn that in the entire dataset altogether, which contains unparsed and complex relationships.", "Although this paper applied initially to biological data, like DNA and RNA sequences, it was also tested on textual data; every time, DeepInsight methods performed better, if not significantly better, than the standard machine learning models that have been used to address these types of tasks.", "Thus, we can find several advantages with DeepInsight\u2019s method: it employs a unique method of dimensionality reduction, uses a from of data augmentation and up-sampling, and can find hidden structures from sparse and hyper-dimensional data. Building upon the advantages of CNN structures, DeepInsight can utilize mitigated memory and faster runtimes.", "In practice, however, it would be wise to have DeepInsight be one contributing member in an ensemble of other decision-making models. Combining the locality-specific nature of DeepInsight with the more global approach of other models will yield a more informed prediction.", "Generally, DeepInsight is one of many recent advancements seeking to cross the boundaries of machine learning, whether it is bridging unsupervised and supervised learning, image or text data, finding data answers within questions and learning in its absence, and even attaining sophisticated models without defining architectures or, for that matter, a completely random one.", "Recent research in deep learning is characterized by pushing traditional limits, and that\u2019s what makes it exciting. Keep your eyes open \u2014 this innovative field will progress and transform in a blink.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "ML enthusiast.
