An estimated 500 million tweets are sent on Twitter very day. That works out to about 5,787 per second. But if you concentrate on meaningful subsets in that flood of data, you can make sense of it.", "In this article, I\u2019ll take a look at some of the tools and techniques available to obtain, analyze and visualize the data in a way that discerns the Twitter influencers from those who are just shouting into an empty space. I\u2019ll also introduce NodeXL, a network visualization tool that makes analysis of your data much easier.", "I\u2019ll be using graph database technology, which structures your data as a network of nodes and connections between them, as opposed to the traditional rows and columns. I wrote about the use of graph database technology in two previous articles: \u2018How I learned to stop worrying and love the graph database\u2019 and \u2018The Boogaloo Underworld\u2019.", "Twitter is much more friendly to developers and data analysts than Facebook and other social media platforms. The Twitter API gives developers access to all the data needed to do the network graph analytics I\u2019ll be demonstrating. In most cases, whether you\u2019re using the API or the tools I outline below, Twitter will limit your access to historical data to no more than 7 days back.", "But if you want something faster and easier than the Twitter API, look no further than TAGS (the \u201cTwitter Archiving Google Sheet\u201d). Developed as a \u201chobby\u201d project by Martin Hawksey (@mhawksey), TAGS is a free Google Sheet template that allows you to retrieve tweets by username, hashtag and other parameters.", "If you want to gather your data in real time, you can set up your job in TAGS and just let it run for a few days. Your data will be stored in a Google sheet and can be downloaded into a .csv or Excel file for further analysis. Full instructions on setting up and using TAGS are available on the TAGS site.", "Another easy way to grab data is Socialbearing.com, which allows you to search by username, hashtag and other parameters. Results are returned in a dashboard (see below). You can download the underlying data in a .csv style for analysis. While obtaining basic data from Socialbearing is free, more specialized reports, such as those going beyond the usual 7-day Twitter limit, are available for a price.", "For the analyses below, it\u2019s important to focus on the retweets only. That\u2019s because most experts think that the frequency with which someone gets retweeted is as good a measure as we have of their influence. The bottom line is that you can tweet all day long. But retweets by others are the best measure of whether anyone else is actually paying attention.", "Whatever method you use to retrieve the data, you\u2019ll be surprised at how well structured it is. But there\u2019s a little work to do before it\u2019s ready for analysis. First, you\u2019ll need to extract the information about who is being retweeted from the text of the tweet. The text of a retweet begins with \u201cRT @<username>\u201d followed by the text of the original tweet.", "How you extract that will depend on the tool you\u2019re using to prepare your data. In my case, I first imported the data into Tableau and used the following regular expression to extract the retweet information from the text of each tweet:", "If you\u2019re using something else, the logic of the regular expression is as follows:", "It searches a column named \u201ctext\u201d for the \u201c@\u201d symbol followed by any string of lower and upper letters and numbers and \u201c_\u201d. The \u201cLOWER()\u201d function puts whatever is extracted into lower case to avoid having the same user name being counted twice based on its case. Whatever gets extracted needs to be put into a new column.", "Since the analysis concentrates on retweets, you will also need a column showing the type of tweet.", "If you use Socialbearing.com to download your data, you\u2019ll find that for each tweet, it already has a column labeled \u2018Tweet Type\u201d that you can use to filter out anything but retweets.", "If you use TAGS, you\u2019ll have to take an extra step to extract the retweet data from the text of the tweet. Using Tableau, I was able to get what I needed from the text of the tweet with the following statement:", "The logic in this one is pretty much self-explanatory. If the text of the tweet contains \u201cRT @\u201d it\u2019s a retweet. If it contains \u201c@\u201d without the \u201cRT\u201d, it means a user was mentioned. That\u2019s another potential measure of influence, but I won\u2019t be using it in the analysis below. If neither of those conditions applies, it gets labeled as an \u201coriginal tweet\u201d.", "Finally, you\u2019ll need to restructure the data for use in a network analysis tool like NodeXL. There are two primary data types:", "Nodes (also know as \u201cvertices\u201d in NodeXL): the data points in the network. In the analyses below, for example, each Twitter user is a node.", "Edges: the relationships between the nodes. If one Twitter user retweets another, the line between them on the graph is an edge.", "For one of the analyses here, which examines who President Trump is most likely to retweet, that structure is shown in the image below. It consists of a \u201cRetweeted By\u201d column for the user sending the retweet, and an \u201cOriginated By\u201d column for the originator of the tweet. I\u2019ve also added a \u201cCount\u201d column, which shows how many times Trump retweeted by each originator.", "In NodeXL, each Twitter user, or node, is known as a \u201cvertex\u201d. And when paired together with another user, as shown below, the two become an \u201cedge\u201d. The count is included to allow NodeXL to run some rudimentary calculations on the network and add visual enhancements.", "NodeXL is a project of the Social Media Research Foundation. Strictly speaking, it\u2019s not an application but a template that you download and add to Microsoft Excel. Once that\u2019s done, you have a new set of Excel tools for network analysis and visualization.", "That comes with a cost, especially for Mac users and open source enthusiasts. NodeXL only works with Microsoft Excel. And you have to have the Windows version of Excel. It will not work with the Mac OS version.", "If you\u2019re not a Windows user, NodeXL recommends running a cloud-based Windows virtual machine, such as those available through the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. I opted for a local Windows VM on my Mac, using a Parallels VM. In my testing, NodeXL ran fine on a local VM, albeit a little slowly.", "The size of the network that NodeXL can handle depends on system RAM. The product\u2019s documentation provides the following estimates:", "Everything in the two examples below can be done on the basic version of NodeXL, which is free. Advanced features, including things like content analysis and advanced network metrics, require the Pro version of NodeXL, which will cost you from $39 to $799 per year, depending on whether you are a student, academic/non-profit or commercial user.", "To use the basic version of NodeXL, you only have to register on the SMRF website, download it and install it like any other Windows application. It will show up as \u201cNodeXL Excel Template\u201d on the Windows start menu. Click on it and it will start Excel with the NodeXL template installed. You\u2019ll see an item on the Excel menu ribbon for \u201cNodeXL Basic\u201d that exposes all of the NodeXL features.", "A full explanation of NodeXL\u2019s features are beyond the scope of this article. But an overview and documentation are available on the SMRF website.", "The network graph above was created from a dataset of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets from January 2020 through the end of April 2020, which amounts to 3,623 tweets, of which 1,806 were retweets.", "When placed into the nodes-and-edges structure needed for network analysis, that comes to 497 edges, which would obviously make for a pretty busy graph. Some filtering is in order. I first limited the data to only those users Trump retweeted five or more times. Then I removed White House staffers and political appointees. Finally, I removed those in which Trump retweeted himself, as he had done 144 times.", "That gave me what I think was a pretty good picture of who, outside of his own inner circle, tended to produce tweets that met with Trump\u2019s approval.", "To make the graph above, I first imported the nodes and edges data into the NodeXL template. The next step was to select a layout style for the NodeXL graph. I used the Fruchteman-Reingold layout algorithm, which tends to avoid the visual clutter of having edges cross one another. Fruchteman-Reingold, coupled with a dataset in which Trump had an edge with every other user, produced the circular layout above.", "Fruchteman-Reingold is one in a category of algorithms known as \u201cforce-directed.\u201d I won\u2019t go into it here (in part because my understanding of it is pretty rudimentary), but I\u2019ve found that of all the algorithms available in NodeXL, it seems most likely to produce an uncluttered, visually pleasing graph.", "To make the graph more interesting, I used the Twitter API to download profile pictures of each user and then placed the images on the graph by referencing the file names in the NodeXL template. I set the thickness of each edge line to correspond to the number of retweets Trump sent from each user.", "I set the color of the line based on the type of user: red for Republicans, green for media outlets and personalities and black for anyone else. This involved some manual work. For each of Trump\u2019s retweet favorites, I checked the Twitter profiles and entered the appropriate color into the NodeXL template. Not surprisingly, those most likely to be favored with a retweet to Trump\u2019s 86 million followers are Republicans in the House and Senate.", "On the afternoon of August 23, a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back. The question of how the shooting occurred set two investigations in motion: one by local, state and federal authorities; and another on Twitter, where things move a lot faster.", "The graph above provides a view of who was having the most success trying to influence public opinion about the Blake shooting on Twitter. It is based on retweets using the #JacobBlake hashtag over the three days following the shooting, a period that also included the killing of two demonstrators by a pro-police protester with an assault rifle.", "The graph has its limits. It only covers three days. And unlike the Trump graph, which focuses on one individual and those seeking his favor, events like the one in Kenosha are dynamic, with new users constantly joining and new hashtags developing.", "The graph was developed in much the same way as the Trump graph: restructuring the Twitter data into a set of nodes and edges, importing it into NodeXL and graphing it using the Fruchteman-Reingold algorithm. But the difference between this and one with a central node like Trump graph is obvious.", "There were 1,156 users who sent #JacobBlake tweets that were retweeted. So again, some filtering was required to create a readable graph. In this case, I used NodeXL to calculate a graph metric known as \u201cdegree centrality\u201d, which is based on the number of connections to a given node. I left all the nodes on the graph, but added labels and tweet content only to those with a degree centrality of 100 or more.", "The paid version of NodeXL includes the ability to do more sophisticated calculations, including the \u201cEigenvector centrality\u201d which bases a node\u2019s score on how well-connected its connections are to other nodes. Google\u2019s \u201cpage rank\u201d algorithm, which ranks search results based on how well-connected the pages linking to a given web site are, is a variation on the same idea.", "Overall, NodeXL is much easier to use than some of the tools I wrote about in the earlier articles, such as Gephi and Neo4J. NodeXL is not as powerful and full featured. But for a limited data set that requires a quick network analysis, I found it to be a very useful and versatile tool. It doesn\u2019t have Gephi\u2019s quirks and it doesn\u2019t require you to stand up a full-blown graph database like NodeXL. If you\u2019re willing to go the Windows/Excel route, I highly recommend it.", "Finally, some resources you may find helpful:", "\u00b7 If you want to take a deep dive into NodeXL, the best resource I found is the book \u201cAnalyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL. Insights from a Connected World\u201d by Derek L. Hanson, Ben Shneiderman, Marc A. Smith and Itai Himelboim.", "\u00b7 For an overview of analyzing social networks, you should take a look at the online course \u201cSocial Media Analytics: Using Data to Understand Public Conversations\u201d offered by the Queensland (Australia) University of Technology.", "\u00b7 For some stunning examples of the kind of work that can be done with NodeXL, take a look at the NodeXL graph gallery.", "Your home for data science.
