It is no longer limited to web design and can be used for mobile development, game design, and even Machine Learning(ML). In the past few years, many new ML libraries were created and the functionalities have become rather impressive.", "It can be argued that Python is the one and only language for Machine Learning. While it is true to a certain extent, it has become difficult to ignore the rising popularity of JavaScript(JS) in this field. After experimenting with a few of those libraries I have decided to publish a list of the most promising and functional machine and deep learning libraries for JavaScript.", "Before diving straight into the article, let's consider what we care about in an ML library. Here are some points you might want to consider:", "As obvious as it may sound, libraries with an active community get updated frequently. In such a rapidly developing field as Machine Learning we have to ensure our application can support the newest features.", "This point is not necessarily about the number of functions and models but rather about how customizable and extendable they are. If you will need to change some part of the algorithm you probably would not want to rewrite the whole application.", "For anyone new to JavaScript and specifically to ML with JavaScript, it is extremely useful to have well-written documentation. Any guides and YouTube tutorials will also come in handy for the learning process.", "Brain.js is currently one of the most popular ML libraries written in JavaScript. It provides multiple ways of implementing neural networks and has good browser support. Since it is so popular, many companies actually use it and you can find various projects online. The documentation is available on GitHub and is fairly well organized. I did not have any issues in finding specific functions and their usage.", "The code and functions do seem to be a little simpler in comparison with Tensorflow for example. However, this might have been influenced by my previous JavaScript experience.", "This library is well known among more experienced developers. The code for the project is open-source and available on GitHub. The library is constantly being updated with the help of the supporting community. It is also available under Nodejs which is a great feature. ConvNetJS is well-rated for its functionality and professionalism. It certainly deserves more attention than it gets and after using it you might as well become a supporting fan.", "Tensorflow is one of the most known Python ML libraries and the most known ML library overall. The release of TensorFlow for JS is one of those events that have shaped the development of ML on JavaScript. Knowing that there is such a massive fan base for TensorFlow and the regularity of updates and improvements, it is hard to go wrong with this library. TensorFlow knowledge is a must for any ML application developer.", "The developers have heavily focused on optimizing in-browser support for the library. It allows for more interactivity and better feedback. From the user's perspective, ML running in a browser window does not require any packages or installations, it is simple and functional. Check out Emoji Scavenger Hunt to get some ideas. This game makes use of your mobile camera to detect objects in real-time. This is pretty impressive, especially keeping in mind you can play such a game in your browser.", "The library supports both the GPU and CPU training. Existing pre-trained models can be easily converted into Tensorflow.js format and loaded into the browser. It can also be retrained in the browser itself after some user data was collected. For game development and many other fields, it creates endless opportunities.", "JavaScript is possibly not the first language that comes to mind when thinking about Machine Learning. However, it has been steadily moving in that direction. Developers enjoy using JavaScript for its interactivity support and constantly growing community. Feel free to share your own experience with these libraries and do not be afraid to try something new!", "Your home for data science.
