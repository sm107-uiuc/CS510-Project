Data Scientist at Recurly, SF.", "Interviewee: Dr. Jeannette Wing, Avanessians Director of the Data Science Institute and Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University (2017-). Former Corporate Vice President at Microsoft Research (2013\u20132017). Former Head of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University (Twice).", "What were your main responsibilities at Microsoft Research?", "There were two main functions for running the corporate research lab.", "I was in charge of both of these responsibilities across all our research labs across the globe, such as ones in Redmond, New York City, Cambridge (England), Bangalore (India), and Beijing (China).", "Were you involved in Microsoft\u2019s investments in AI projects? If so, what were some challenges you faced?", "I was involved in the investing in research related to machine learning, AI, and data science more generally in terms of people we hired and projects we supported, as well as our engagements with the business units. I was in an actual business unit called \u201cAI and Research\u201d. The AI part of that business unit worked with other business units to make sure that other business units were aware of the latest ML and AI techniques and how to take advantage of the research ideas that were coming out from the research arm of the company.", "What is \u201cComputational Thinking\u201d, the idea that you originated and popularized?", "Computational Thinking (CT) is the thought processes for formulating a problem and expressing its solutions in a way that a computer be it a human or machine would effectively carry out. It\u2019s a loaded definition and each of the words is very important. But to better intuitively understand what CT is, it\u2019s thinking like a computer scientist.", "There are certain techniques and ways of problem solving that computer scientists do on a daily basis. Some are:", "This collection of problem solving techniques and collection of ways one approaches a big system or a big problem \u2014 this is what I mean by thinking like a computer scientist.", "The point of the 2006 article where I wrote about Computational Thinking was two-fold:", "In fact, how to program is just a skill that you learn to be a computer scientist. What is more important than knowing how to program is the problem solving skills that CS teaches its students. These skills are even more important than knowing how to program if you\u2019re not going to be a computer scientist.", "Since 2006, not only has that interface on both sides changed, but also there\u2019s been much more discussion on how to incorporate CS into K-12 education around the world.", "What is the Data Science Institute (DSI)?", "DSI is a university-wide and university-level institute. It works with every school on campus and all other institutes/centers on campus. This really goes to speak to my point that data is everywhere and everyone can benefit from analyzing the data we have. We work with history/english faculty, teachers, medical school (genomics, public health), law school, business students, etc.", "DSI has a 3-part mission statement that I hope conveys the ambition I have.", "These three components can be summarized as follows: data for good, data to do good, and data responsibility.", "Can you speak to some of the Institute\u2019s innovative data science research?", "There are specific research examples I can cite:", "Can you comment more on ethics in AI, a topic not as often talked about, but seminal to all Data Scientists?", "What we are learning is that people are very excited about AI and machine learning applied to almost everything: making recommendations on books to buy and movies to watch, computer vision systems in our self-driving cars, making predictions/classifications on medical treatments.", "When talking about book recommendations it\u2019s probably okay to get it wrong \u2014 we aren\u2019t going to upset the end user. But when talking about self-driving cars or medical diagnoses, we need to make sure that the systems are correct, reliable, safe, secure, and also ethical and fair.", "Another whole area of application where AI\u2019s already being used for is making decisions about whether someone should get bail or not. We\u2019re making decisions on whether to hire you or not. You want all of these decisions to be fair. But if the models are being trained on biased data, then the models are going to be biased, and that\u2019s not fair.", "So all of the sudden, these ML models are being used in safety-critical, life-critical situations, in making decisions about people and these decisions are going to affect us for life. We want to make sure that these models are fair, that they can be trusted in outcome. Right now there\u2019s no good reason to trust anything. So I\u2019m promoting a whole area called \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d to look at safety, security, reliability, fairness, robustness, all sorts of these properties for the particular ML model in context, per task, per domain.", "For the full interview with Dr. Jeannette Wing, please click here for the YouTube video.", "Your home for data science.
