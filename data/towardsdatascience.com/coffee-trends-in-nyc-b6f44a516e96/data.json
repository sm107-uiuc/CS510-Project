Most people, actually, because they have never had the opportunity to taste it. Canada\u2019s province of Qu\u00e9bec produces 70% of the world\u2019s maple syrup supply. In the time that I have spent living in Montreal, I have encountered many foreign visitors who arrive with the bucket list goal of trying maple syrup. And they don\u2019t just want any maple syrup \u2014 they want the best pure Canadian maple syrup they can find. This made me wonder what the demand for Canadian maple syrup might look like outside of Canada. Do other countries want more of it? I read through Reddit conversations on the topic of maple syrup as a preliminary step to developing my intuition on this question. Several patterns revealed themselves quickly:", "It\u2019s the last two observations that interested me the most. What if I were to be the engine behind a Canadian maple syrup coffee trend in a prosperous, coffee-loving American city? New York City fit the description perfectly, and so this project was born.", "I have been building a simulator that will allow me to analyze potential trends that could arise among coffee shops in NYC, specifically in the context of Canadian maple syrup coffee. The underlying idea is that when a coffee shop makes the decision to adopt a trend, it generates a theoretical influence on nearby competitors to do the same, and the effect ripples throughout a network of coffee shops. I am using probability theory to model the trend adoption probability for each of the shops in this project\u2019s dataset, and graph theory to model the shops as a network. The network can be viewed as a simple graph in which each shop is a node, and two nodes have an edge between them if and only if they are sufficiently close geographically. Each node\u2019s trend adoption probability is dependent not only on characteristics directly related to itself but also on the characteristics and adoption probabilities of the other nodes in the network. So far I have completed the first version of the simulator, which I discuss at the end of this article. The plan is to build up the simulator in iterations, starting simple and gradually adding to the list of conditions that determine how the network updates over time.", "The data I have collected is with regards to coffee shops in NYC. To acquire this data I used an API from a popular restaurant review website to search 9 coffee-related words (\u2018coffee\u2019, \u2018cafe\u2019, \u2018espresso\u2019, \u2018latte\u2019, \u2018cappuccino\u2019, \u2018macchiato\u2019, \u2018americano\u2019, \u2018mocha\u2019, \u2018decaf\u2019) for each of 6 locations (\u2018NYC\u2019, and its 5 boroughs, \u2018Staten Island\u2019, \u2018Brooklyn\u2019, \u2018Manhattan\u2019, \u2018Queens\u2019, \u2018Bronx\u2019), for a total of 54 searches. The data returned was in the JSON format, so I then built some functions in Python which allowed me to convert it into a Pandas DataFrame I could explore.", "Once I finally had my data prepared in a table, I was curious first and foremost to see how the coffee shops are dispersed throughout NYC. By creating a map of NYC with a point at the location of each shop, I could get a better sense of how the network is organized, and in particular, which areas are dense with coffee shops and which are not.", "The map immediately reveals many points that do not belong in the dataset. Any point which satisfies at least one of the following three bullets needs to be removed:", "Removing points that satisfy either of the first two bullets amounts to clicking the map on Google Maps near the western-most, eastern-most, southern-most and northern-most points of NYC to estimate its longitude and latitude ranges, and then filtering out points that don\u2019t fall within these ranges. The points that lie within the longitude and latitude ranges but outside NYC are a little trickier to remove. I built three functions for filtering out such points, one which removes all points north-west of the input point, one which removes all points north-east of the input point, and one which removes all points south-east of the input point.", "The functions were iteratively applied to the dataset with various input points, carefully selected from Google Maps in such a way that no points from NYC would be removed. This resulted in a dataset that captures only coffee shops in NYC, as desired.", "The updated map reveals that there is a high density of coffee shops in Manhattan and northern Brooklyn. Staten Island, Queens and the Bronx, on the other hand, appear to be lacking in coffee shops \u2014 relatively speaking. This is useful to know when building the simulator; presumably, it is more probable that a trend would go viral in an area that is dense with coffee shops.", "At this point the dataset consists of 4036 rows, where each row corresponds to one coffee shop in NYC. There are three particular features of interest that I investigated, as they will be key in building the simulator:", "Because rating is dependent on reviews, analyzing reviews was an obvious first choice for the univariate analysis.", "You may have heard it before: 80% of a company\u2019s sales come from 20% of its products; 80% of a student\u2019s productivity is generated by 20% of his or her tasks; 80% of all crimes are committed by 20% of all criminals; 80% of all beer is drunk by 20% of all beer drinkers. This is the 80\u201320 rule, or the Pareto Principle, which observes that in a wide variety of cause-and-effect natural phenomena, the vast majority of the effects (often around 80%) are generated by a small minority of the causes (often around 20%). In this project\u2019s dataset, 69% of all reviews are generated by the top 20% of coffee shops by number of reviews, which is close enough to say that the Pareto Principle is unmasking itself here. Whenever I have a continuous variable that could be described as a natural phenomenon, I like to make this verification as a way to provide evidence that my dataset is not biased. I would be skeptical of how representative my dataset is of all of the coffee shops in NYC if reviews didn\u2019t follow an exponential distribution.", "The kernel density estimator plot (the continuous analog of a histogram) shows that most of the shops have less than 250 reviews. Further inspecting summary statistics for reviews reveals that this feature has a wide range of 1 to 7693 (suggesting there are likely many outliers), with a median of 86 and a mean of 207. The mean is much higher than the median because reviews is skewed right. Becoming better acquainted with this feature is necessary because the simulator will be built in such a way that shops with more reviews will have more influence in the network.", "Next I wanted to analyze the two categorical features, price and rating. I decided to treat rating as categorical because it has only 11 possible integer values, which can be thought of as classes.", "The observation that there are so few shops at the highest price level will be important in the bivariate analysis involving price. This says that the sample size for xxxx shops is small, and so we should be hesitant to draw conclusions confidently when analyzing them. Nonetheless, these shops will be important for the simulator, as it will be built in such a way that expensive shops will have greater influence on their competitors than inexpensive shops.", "It\u2019s also valuable to note that rating is skewed left, with an invisible number of shops in any of the three lowest ratings (0, 1, 2). The simulator will assign higher influence to coffee shops that have higher ratings. I will use the relative counts of the various ratings to help calibrate how strongly rating will contribute to a shop\u2019s influence on its neighbors in the network. Because the bar chart shows that high rated shops are not rare, I will assign less influence to these shops than I would if the bar chart were instead skewed right.", "Now that I had a better idea of how the distributions of the three features looked, it was time to compare the features pairwise, starting with rating vs. price.", "The univariate analysis revealed that the sample sizes for the different levels of price are quite different, so it makes more sense to compare relative counts of rating as price increases rather than absolute counts. As price increases, rating increases. Evidence for this is found in observing that the rating of the lowest rated shop increases as price increases. Furthermore, the fraction of shops that have a rating below 7 \u2014 that is, the orange area as a fraction of the total area of the bars\u2014 shrinks as price increases. This second pattern somewhat breaks down for the highest price level, but this can likely be explained as a case of variance induced by a small sample size of xxxx shops. Because more expensive shops tend to receive higher ratings, they are plausibly more successful and therefore more open to experimenting with a new trend. This insight will be used in the initialization step of the simulator, where randomly selected shops adopt the maple syrup trend; more expensive shops will be assigned higher initialization probabilities.", "Next I compared price and reviews.", "For the first three levels, as price increases, so do the first quartile, the median and the third quartile of reviews. The shops in the xxxx class do not obey this pattern, but again, the sample size of such shops is small, so we shouldn\u2019t invest too much belief in what the data tells us about them. That price and reviews are positively correlated is reassuring, given that it has already been decided that they will both positively drive trend adoption probabilities in the simulator.", "To conclude the bivariate analysis I then compared rating and reviews.", "The scatterplot suggests that reviews increases as rating increases, but because there are so many points with a rating of 7, 8 or 9 that are not explicitly visible, I decided to consult summary statistics of reviews. From the table we can see that as rating increases from 2 to 8, the mean and first three quartiles are increasing; from 2 to 9, the max is increasing. The mean and first three quartiles are relatively large as well for shops with a rating of 9, just not quite as large as they are for shops with a rating of 8.", "Because rating correlates positively with reviews, and reviews represents the sample size of rating, higher rated shops have ratings which are more trustworthy. This is useful to know for the simulator because it tells me I should assign higher variance to the probability distributions associated with the influence of lower rated shops.", "At this point it should not come as a surprise that as rating and price increase simultaneously, so does reviews:", "This helps further solidify the conclusions drawn from the bivariate analyses of price vs. reviews and rating vs. reviews.", "The network of coffee shops in the dataset can be viewed as a simple graph. Each coffee shop is a node in the graph, and an edge exists between a pair of nodes if and only if the pair of shops are sufficiently close geographically.", "To construct the edges for the graph of the full network, I first defined a function that computes the Euclidean distance between a pair of points using their geographical coordinates. Then I created a function which takes max_distance as an input, and outputs a Python dictionary where the keys are the coffee shop id\u2019s and the value associated with a key is a list of all other coffee shop id\u2019s which are a distance of at most max_distance away from the key. In other words, the keys are the nodes and the value associated with a key is a list of all nodes that have an edge with the key.", "There was no way of knowing in advance what an appropriate choice for the max_distance parameter might be. If max_distance is too small then there will be too few edges and low connectivity in the graph; influence will be underestimated. If max_distance is too large then there will be too many edges and high connectivity in the graph; influence will be overestimated. As a first step towards finding an appropriate value for this parameter, I computed the maximum and average number of neighbors among the nodes in the network for various values of max_distance.", "How quickly the trend spreads in the simulation is strongly driven by avg_degree. If this value is too large then the simulation will overestimate how quickly the trend spreads; more neighbors means more incoming influence. I decided therefore to only test values of max_distance \u2264 0.004 in any future analysis for version 1 so that avg_degree \u2264 23, which seemed to be a reasonable upper bound. A distance of 0.004 corresponds to a radius that typically extends no further than 6 NYC streets away from a given coffee shop.", "Each node in the network has a Boolean state associated with it at any given moment, where True means that the shop is following the trend at that moment. The initial states are randomized using binomial distributions, and the network updates in iterations, where the states at each iteration after the first are determined by the states at the previous iteration and the following two rules:", "An iteration can be thought of as a unit of time, for example a month or a year. I built a function that outputs the results of a simulation as a table, where the rows correspond to the nodes and the columns correspond to the Boolean states of the nodes at each iteration.", "At this point it still wasn\u2019t clear what a good choice for max_distance might be; I only had the intuitive guess that an upper bound of 0.004 seemed reasonable, so I experimented with max_distance values of 0.001, 0.002, 0.003 and 0.004. It also wasn\u2019t clear what appropriate choices for p_x, p_xx, p_xxx and p_xxxx might be. To minimize the growing complexity of options, I decided to make these initialization probabilities equal in version 1 of the simulator, but to experiment with different values. I figured that in a dataset of 4036 shops, persuading 10 shops to initially adopt an idea didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched. This corresponds to an initialization probability of 10/4036, or about 0.0025, so I experimented with initialization probabilities of 0.0005, 0.0010, 0.0015, 0.0020 and 0.0025 for each of the max_distance values. For each (max_distance, init_prob) pair the simulator was run with 100 different random seeds to generate a sample of simulations with these particular parameter values. The number of True shops was then averaged across all seeds, grouped by max_distance, init_prob and the iteration.", "In the spirit of being realistic, I decided to analyze simulations in between these extremes. I had already calculated that init_prob = 0.0025 seemed to be a reasonable starting point, but even with max_distance as low as 0.002 the average simulation grows unreasonably quick from it_0 to it_1. I therefore settled with max_distance = 0.001, and the simulation below was generated.", "The trend is initialized predominantly in Manhattan and northern Brooklyn, and it spreads from there. This should come as no surprise, as these regions are dense with coffee shops. In pushing the maple syrup coffee trend a reasonable strategy might be to focus on selling the idea to a few influential shops in these regions and then watching it spread organically.", "The principal weakness in this first version is that the trend is unlikely to spread in regions that are not dense with coffee shops. The next version will aim to correct for this.", "Throughout the first version of the simulator it has been implicitly assumed that the weight of the influence that any shop has on any of its neighbors is fixed. In the next version I will refine this approach by quantifying the influence between each pair of neighboring shops using the rating, reviews and price features. I will also include some feature-engineered variables such as is_starbucks and is_starbucks_neighbor, which offer special treatment to the dataset\u2019s most frequent coffee shop. Whether or not a shop adopts the trend in any iteration beyond the random initialization stage will be determined by the influences of its neighbors, as well as some random noise introduced into the network to account for the unpredictability of people. This will result in a more realistic simulator, which in particular will allow for the trend to propagate in regions other than just Manhattan and northern Brooklyn.", "Code: The code for this project and all future versions of the simulator can be found on my GitHub page.", "Contact: Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments or suggestions at nathanburnsds@gmail.com or on LinkedIn.", "In closing, I would like to gratefully acknowledge Susan Holcomb for all of the prompt and thorough feedback she has offered throughout this project.", "Your home for data science.
