I\u2019ve been working with text data for almost 6 months and I feel there are many challenges when you working on a product that will be used by many people.", "Here are the few techniques you\u2019ll see everywhere-", "What happens when you remove numbers?", "Numbers play an important role in sentiment analysis. How? Consider you provide sentiment analysis service to Food Delivering App which takes feedback through text. Now, if during text preprocessing you remove all numbers then how are you going to distinguish between 2 feedbacks that say- \u201cI will rate the food 5 out of 5\u201d and \u201cI will rate the food 1 out of 5\u201d. This is just one example. There are numerous cases where numbers play a role.", "What happens when you remove emojis?", "Emojis can help you to correctly asses the mood of the person when he is writing the comment. How? If someone writes feedback \u201cFood was \ud83d\ude0b\u201d and some other person wrote, \u201cFood was \ud83d\ude16\u201d. With the help of emojis, it is clearly visible the person is trying to say. There are numerous more cases.", "What happens when you remove stop words?", "I\u2019ve discussed this in my previous article. If you wanna know in-depth then you should definitely read this article.", "Since we are here let\u2019s quickly discuss what problems can occur when stop words are removed. The most common method to remove stop words is with the help of the NLTK library. NLTK\u2019s stopword list also contains words like not, doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t, etc which shouldn\u2019t be removed for obvious reasons but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t remove any of the stopwords.", "If you are using methods like TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, BOW then it becomes necessary to remove stopwords(not all) otherwise they create a lot of noise. Deep Learning methods that use pre-trained embedding are currently the best methods to handle all these. The good thing about deep learning methods is that they do not require any kind of preprocessing. If you\u2019re interested more about deep learning methods then you can check out my article on this", "What happens when you lemmatize or stem?", "Lemmatize and stem both generate the root form of the word except stem may generate a word that doesn\u2019t exist in the dictionary. Lemmatization is used more widely than stemming and also for this article we considering lemmatization.", "Lemmatization plays an important role when you are using TF-IDF, CountVectorizer or BOW model. Why? because every word will be reduced to its base form. Example- \u201cdogs\u201d will be reduced to \u201cdog\u201d. Since these methods create a sparse matrix we need to convert all words to their base form in order to reduce the number of unique words. The problem is that many times you lose the context of a word by converting it to its base form.", "Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis with word embedding follows a different approach. Instead of the sparse matrix, it would create an n-dimensional vector. So, in that n-dimensional vector words like \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d would be closer to each other. So, the need to lemmatize becomes unnecessary. There are many more advantages with vector embedding apart from this.", "So, far we have discussed many issues. Some of them still come under the area of research but we could try solving some.", "Are deep learning methods really good?", "Yes, they are much more powerful. DL methods take word order into account while prediction. If you jumble words of a sentence and apply TF-IDF, CountVectorizer or BOW then the chance of getting the same result is too high.", "Recently, pre-trained models like BERT, Robert, etc proved that NLP tasks can be done much better with deep learning methods. The advantage with these methods is that they work just like Transfer Learning and you would actually need much fewer examples as compared to training them from scratch.", "If you are interested in knowing more about how sentiment analysis works, you can read it here \u2014 https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/.", "Your home for data science.
