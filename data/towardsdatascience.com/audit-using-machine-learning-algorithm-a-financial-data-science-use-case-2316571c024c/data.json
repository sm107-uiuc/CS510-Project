It is everywhere in one way or the other with applications in health sciences, space exploration, image recognition , robotics, fraud detection etc. If you have ever watched something on Netflix or Prime, there are high chances that you have been exposed to the amazing movie recommender algorithms!", "How we can employ ML techniques in a typical internal audit function to reduce false negatives and increase efficiency. Side effects: Cost reduction.", "Finance is no different and we have been seeing a massive shift of organisations to application of advanced data science techniques for insights generation, forecasting, budgeting and fraud risk.", "While I was researching on the use case of ML on a day to day audit, being a finance professional, one very real world problem we all face is that \u201cwhat is different from norm\u201d?", "Imagine you have 1,600 transactions (or purchase invoices) where each transaction represents the \u2018Quantity purchased\u2019 (Volume) and \u2018Amount\u2019 paid for that quantity. To identify any outliers (i.e. transactions not following a normal pattern), in a typical audit environment, we would go in and try to extract a random sample from the population and then hope our \u2018random\u2019 sampling detects any such anomaly. This is sometimes both time consuming and counter-productive since we have a risk of missing out actual outlier not getting picked up by our sample and hence reporting a false negative. This can have detrimental impact on both cost and efficiency of the audit function.", "So I have tried to employee an ML algorithm (KNN, which is explained further down) to address the above and automate the anomaly detection. This algorithm is using both Volume and Amount features from the invoice and calculating the outliers in the set of 1,600 such invoices.", "Now good algorithm or code is as good as the story we tell. So before I go to nitty-gritty of the codes, below is a one page Executive summary or an elevator speech that can be shared with our business stakeholders:", "Please keep reading below if you want to know how the model is built.", "A package in Python that is specifically used for outlier detection modelling is called PyOD. This package (which I installed using pip install pyod) offers a variety of algorithms to detect outliers and is pretty easy to implement. In this article I will however restrict myself to use case of one proximity-based model known as KNN or K-Nearest Neighbour from this module. KNN is a mathematical model that measures the distance to its nearest Kth neighbour and identifies outlier in the data based on that distance. This is a classification algorithm that classifies the outliers as a binary outcome of \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019 or say \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019.", "Here is the step wise approach:", "For any data science project, generating meaningful random datasets is as important as the algorithm or code itself. So I highly recommend reading good resources on \u2018random data\u2019 and \u2018seed\u2019. The datasets generated is a set of 1600 purchase invoices representing two features i.e. \u2018Volume\u2019 purchased and \u2018Amount\u2019 paid for that invoice during the month. Below is how it looks like (imaginary but still look real enough!)", "Let\u2019s quickly visualise how the data looks like using Plotly scatter plot. Please refer to my article for a quick rundown on Plotly visualisation here.", "Now comes the fun part where we actually build our model and train the algorithm. These are the steps that I would generally follow:", "2. Split train and test data: I have used an 80:20 train/test split. Then have first trained the model using training data and tested the same using test data. A visualisation of anomaly scores generated by the model gives us an indication of how the normal and abnormal data is split.", "3. Visualise train and test scores: Let\u2019s visualise how the anomaly scores look like as a simple histogram using \u2018y_train_scores\u2019 and \u2018y_test_scores\u2019. Notice the number of anomalies.", "4. Apply model to the given dataset: Now I have used the same dataset generated above for this example to demonstrate how we can get the final results.", "5. Bringing it all together: In this step we append the predicted labels (\u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019) to the dataset, visualise and filter on outliers (\u20181\u2019) to get the list of invoices that require further investigation:", "The above demonstrates a very simplistic example of Machine Learning use case in finance and audit environment. There are definitely number of factors and use of multiple models that we need to consider in a real world problem but in the interest of article\u2019s length I have restricted it to KNN only.", "In future articles, I will delve further into application and use cases of Data Science in Finance and accounting world. Being on self-learning journey, please feel free to comment or connect for sharing ideas or thoughts about this.", "For further resources on PyOD, please refer to the documentation link here. There are some really good articles in the link there which gave me a lot of inspiration and help.", "Your home for data science.
