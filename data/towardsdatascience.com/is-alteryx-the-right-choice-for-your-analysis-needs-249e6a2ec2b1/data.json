I didn\u2019t even know what word that was. After getting him to repeat and spell it out for me, I did some Googling. Upon my googling, I couldn\u2019t find a consolidated breakdown of what the software was and what it\u2019s best used for. I had to tediously piece this information together from many searches. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this article: To share conclusions about Alteryx I\u2019ve pieced together and to share my own first-hand experience using it.", "Alteryx is a drag and drop software used for data cleansing, data mining, ETL, spatial analysis, machine learning, and other BI-related activities. Its usage can range from relatively basic activities like joining different data sources and pre-processing (which I will show you in a minute), or complicated activities such as predictive modeling, time series, and simulations.", "Alteryx is both the name of the company that makes the software and the name of the software\u2026 it actually has an interesting backstory. The company was founded in 1997 and used to be called SRC LLC. For its first 15 years, the company focused primarily on geographic business intelligence solutions. It has a history of working on various interesting data-related geographic projects, including partnering with the U.S. census in 2012 to create a tool which helped customers strategically mine/analyze demographic data for their respective use-cases. This was a groundbreaking project, as it was the first time the general public could dig into the demographic makeup of the U.S with such granularity.", "In 2010, the company re-branded to \u201cAlteryx\u201d, taking the name of their leading data analysis software. From this point, the company started defining itself as an all-around data science and analysis company, not exclusively a geographic business intelligence solution. They designed their software to be a drag and drop solution for any associate to perform advanced analytics without as much of a coding / hard-science background.", "However, due to Alteryx\u2019s decades-long background in geospatial data analysis, I believe this is still what separates its software from others.", "So, let\u2019s actually dig into what it\u2019s like to use Alteryx. The image below may look intimidating at first, but it\u2019s actually pretty straightforward.", "Let\u2019s dissect the canvas view so we can understand how this works:", "1. At the top, in red, we have various Data Tools we can drag and drop on the screen. Data tools are essentially functions you can apply to your data in an easily visual way. Typically a user would start with the green book icon \u201cInput Data\u201d.", "2. In the middle, in black, is the Canvas. We would then drag whatever icons (data tools) are needed into the canvas, which is the large white space occupying most of the screen. Spiderweb-like connections are made from icon to icon to show the progression of the analysis (we\u2019ll get to this soon)", "3. In yellow, on the left, is the configuration window. Once we drag one or many of these icons, we would configure and customize how each icons functions using the configuration window.", "4. Lastly, at the bottom we have the results window. The results of each data tool can be displayed and interacted with here. This feature is very useful because it allows us to see what was input and output by each data tool, at each step of the way.", "Here we did some basic pre-processing with dummy data, and I\u2019ll walk through step by step what each icon does from left to right:", "1. Input Data: Pulled in data from an excel sheet in this example. Alteryx has the functionality to pull data from various places and formats, however.", "2. Select Data: Renamed and changed the ordering of columns in this step", "3. Data Cleansing: Changed the formatting of the \u201cgender\u201d column which previously had unwanted characters in it", "4. Formula: Created a new column by adding the first and last name columns together", "5. Filter: Filtered the data on 1 specific attribute, the country of residence", "6. Join: Joined another sheet to this existing sheet, similar to Vlookup in Excel or SQL join statements", "7. Text to Column: Split a column based on the \u201c-\u201d chararter", "8. Output: Export the output for further analysis somewhere else, visualization or reporting", "This example is nothing mind-blowing, but it is the very first place you would start when learning to use Alteryx. Pay attention to the configuration window and the results window (which are both showing the detail of the Join data tool in this image)", "Alteryx is a good hybrid choice between using Excel and using SQL/Python/R. I can imagine it being the \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d for many analysts.", "This is where Alteryx comes in to save the day! It\u2019s a great drag and drop solution that fits right in the middle. Below are some additional points of information I\u2019ve gathered in the 2 weeks I spent experimenting.", "Please subscribe if you found this helpful.
