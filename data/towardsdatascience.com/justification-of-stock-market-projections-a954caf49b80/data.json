You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "According to Burton Gordon Malkiel, an American economist and best selling author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street: \u201cUnder scientific scrutiny, chart reading must share a pedestal with alchemy.\u201d Malkiel, along with many others in the field of academia, shares the view that under the terms of the Efficient-market Hypothesis, the stock market is a place for ever so volatile price markers of equities where outcomes are not reasonably predictable based on past data. Then again, is this so often the case?", "The Efficient-market Hypothesis holds the position that: Securities always trade at fair value on exchanges and share prices should represent all relevant information that the generation of alpha is not attainable. Simply put, the hypothesis asserts that in any given time over a period, the market has the ability to adjust to new information and so it is impossible to outperform it. In other words, fundamental analysis holds superiority over technical analysis. One\u2019s guess is as good as the other\u2019s or as Malkiel famously puts it: \u201cYour guess is as good as that of the ape.\u201d", "It should be clearer now why proponents of the Efficient-market Hypothesis, which happens to be the cornerstone of modern financial theory, view the prediction of the stock market as unavailing. However, this does not explain the vast majority of establishments in the financial services sector like trading firms, mutual funds and hedge funds, that employ quantitative trading algorithms and charted data, yielding billions in profit annually through the discipline of technical analysis. Behavioral finance also suggests that investors of the stock market are far from rational, implicating that future prices can in fact be predicted \u2018to an extent\u2019 based on analysis of historical trends. This signifies that there must be some merit to the concept of stock market projection.", "This report aims to explore the validity of predicting the prices of securities. More specifically, it tackles the research question: Can a machine learning model trained on historical stock data forecast future figures accurately and to what extent?", "As such, it features a Univariate Time Series analysis using a type of machine learning algorithm in the Deep Learning class known as LSTM (Long Short-term Memory). Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (MSFT) historical stock data is used for data exploratory, preprocessing, post-processing, visualization, as well as model fitting and evaluation. A fifteen business day forecast of the stock market starting from the most recent date is also made towards the end. Furthermore, mean squared error, root mean squared error and R-squared operate as the main estimators in evaluating the overall performance of the model.", "The resulting values generated by the model were fairly accurate in comparisons to the actual prices. Thus, it was concluded that machine learning can indeed be an effective method to forecast stock data to a high extent.", "The GitHub repository that contains the whole procedure can be accessed here.", "The dataset for MSFT is obtained through a Financial Markets API (Application Programming Interface) called Tinngo and is accessed using the pandas_datareader package. To get a sense of the data being dealt with, here is what it looks like in its raw form after converting it into a data frame.", "The dataset is comprised of fourteen features as indicated by the columns.", "Some simple processes were implemented in the initial clean-up/ formatting stage to prepare the dataset for future use.", "The resulting new data frame is as demonstrated down below:", "Getting a thorough insight into the complex nature of MSFT\u2019s price movements is important, as it can assist in deciding on the most efficient machine learning model later down the line. Since the \u2018Close\u2019 feature covers the equity\u2019s cash value at the end of each trading day, certain visualization methods concerning only \u2018Close\u2019 were performed.", "A box plot and a supplementary description chart are diagrammed to first start off this stage in data visualization.", "From the box plot, it can readily be interpreted that there seems to be no extreme outliers past the minimum and maximum ranges of the distributed data.", "The high standard deviation from the chart does shed some light on the volatile nature of MSFT\u2019s price over the past five years. To be more precise there is a dispersion of $41.91 around the average mean of $96.44. Then again, this value must be considered with a grain of salt as the terms for a standard deviation may be related to a price of an underlying security. This means the value of a standard deviation can reflect the stock price rather than volatility. Hence, the true extent of volatility is assessed using the coefficient of variation, which represents the ratio of standard deviation to the mean. This is useful in understanding the degree of variability of data in a sample in relation to the mean of the population.", "The resulting coefficient of variation is: 41.91 \u00f7 96.44 = 0.4346. As the value is well under 1, it can safely be assumed that MSFT is generally not as highly volatile as previously assumed. In addition, considering the strong financial health of Microsoft Corporation based on its balance sheet, it is expected that risk associated with its equity should be on the lower end.", "In order to better visualize the past trends of the MSFT security, a line graph is plotted. The main highlight of the graph is the huge dip and quick recovery of the security\u2019s value around the months of March to June in the year 2020. This extreme volatility can be explainable by apprehensive attitudes towards the whole of the stock market due to the recent 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.", "As aforementioned, a Univariate Time Series Analysis, which examines a series with a single time- dependent variable, was selected. This was done after the Preliminary Data Visualization stage; and some considerations were made before arriving at this decision:", "Taking these factors into account, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established as the most optimal option to perform a univariate time series forecast. The reasonings fall under the LSTM\u2019s architecture, its ability to store information at every step of a time series, and the nature of the research problem.", "To understand the structure of an LSTM network, one must first comprehend the concepts of artificial neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Artificial neural networks are based on a network of interconnected data processing components known as nodes organized into layers. A given node in a layer is connected to all other nodes in preceding layers by a weight, which influences a signal\u2019s strength and a network\u2019s output. There are three types of nodes: 1) Input node to collect data, 2) Output node to generate a value, 3) Hidden node to modify data.", "A RNN is a type of artificial neural network that operates in a feedforward manner to allow information to travel sequentially from one step to another. However, unlike basic feedforward neural networks, RNNs have recurrence relations between layers. This means they utilize feedback loops, known as Back-propagation Through Time, to relay details back into the network, so that information from prior inputs can persist.", "However, RNNs also deal with the vanishing gradient problem, which is the gradual loss of information between large gaps in periods of time. This occurs when gradients that update the weights in a neural network shrink as a result of Back-propagation Through Time. Long short-term memory networks improve upon this drawback through the implementation of internal mechanisms, the cell state and gates, to regulate the flow of information. While, the cell state transports relevant information throughout the processing of a sequence, gates are different neural networks that select which information can persist on in the cell state. There are three varieties of gates: 1) Forget gate, which selects relevant information to store and pass on, 2) Input gate, that updates the cell state, 3) Output gate, to determine a subsequent hidden state. These operations allow LSTM models to be apt at learning long-term dependencies.", "The LSTM Network is thus established as the most optimal choice to form a model for tackling the report\u2019s time series problem. More information on RNNs and LSTMs can be reviewed here.", "In this section, data from the preprocessing stage is further wrangled, with the aim to prepare it for an LSTM model. A new data frame consisting of only \u2018Close\u2019 and featuring \u2018Date\u2019 as the index values is formed. Since a day end\u2019s cash value is most representative of a security\u2019s price in the market for a particular day the focus is on \u2018Close\u2019.", "LSTM models are sensitive to scales; hence, data from the new data frame is normalized by being scaled from 0 to 1. This will improve the speed at which the network converges.", "The new dataset is then split into two components: 80% Training and 20% Testing. This will allow the model to be trained on the initial 80% of the data (training set) and then its performance will be reevaluated on the remain portion (testing set).", "The \u2018rolling\u2019 variable represents the time-step, which is the amount of days the model will be analyzing to produce an output. Consider the following example down below:", "There is a sequence of values that is used to train a machine learning model. In each row, four values of the sequence are taken in as inputs and the subsequent fifth value as the output; as the rows progress, the group of inputs and outputs shift one value down the series. The variable \u2018rolling\u2019 represents the number of inputs that will be used to produce an output. This concept is further applied to splitting the training and testing sets into inputs and output sets.", "An LSTM network requires a three-dimensional array of data as input. The first dimension represents batch size, the subsequent one portrays time-steps and the last one depicts features. Therefore, the inputs are reshaped to fit these requirements.", "In order to build an LSTM model, certain modules are imported from the Keras library.", "1) Sequential will be used as a constructor for initializing the neural network, 2) LSTM will assist in adding Long Short-term Memory layers, 3) Dense will add a densely connected neural network layer 4) Dropout will add dropout layers to prevent model overfitting.", "The resulting model appears as such:", "The LSTM model is created with the following arguments:", "The model is then fitted with the input and output sets from the training portion of the data. It is then trained with certain features such as epochs, which indicates the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the whole data set, set to 60, batch size assigned to x_train.shape[0] and the validation set given the test set.", "The three estimators selected to evaluate the LSTM model\u2019s performance are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared. MSE shall assess the average of the squares of errors and return error variance. RMSE, which is the square root version of MSE, will compute the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Lastly, the R-squared metric will demonstrate the fit of the regression line to the actual data points, since it measures the percentage of response variable variation that is explained by a model.", "Using Sequential\u2019s predict() and MinMaxScaler\u2019s inverse_transform() functions, predictions are generated from the fitted model and rescaled back from ranges of 0 to 1. This resulted in two sets of price projections; one for the training section and one for the testing section.", "The model\u2019s performance on the training set is assessed by the three model evaluation metrics.", "These MSE and RMSE values immediately point towards the absence of much errors around the actual historical data points, as both are close to 0. The value of R-squared indicates that 99.53% of MSFT\u2019s prices can be explainable by the model. While these results may initially illustrates the astounding accuracy of the predictions there are serious concerns of overfitting, as it may not translate well to unseen data.", "These metrics are better visualized by graphing the actual training data set and its predicted values.", "The model\u2019s performance on the testing set is further assessed by the same three evaluation metrics.", "The MSE and RMSE are higher, and the R-squared is lower than those of the training set. However, these MSE and RMSE are still considered to be very low. This establishes that the modeled set does not deviate much from the actual values. The R-squared value indicates that 94.2% of the MSFT\u2019s prices is explainable by the model.", "Once again, this is visualized by graphing the actual training data set and the predicted values.", "Graph of actual values versus predicted values:", "It can be stated with some degree of confidence that the LSTM model proved to be successful in projecting stock prices. The predicted values in especially the testing portion were fairly accurate in comparisons to the authentic data points; MSE of 0.17 and RMSE of 0.41 are close to 0 and extremely low, thus demonstrating small deviations of errors on average. This impression is further corroborated by an R-squared of 0.942, as the model was able to explain for 94.2% of MSFT\u2019s stock prices in the testing set.", "While there were initial concerns with the model being overfitted on the training set due to its extremely near perfect rates across all three metrics, it actually ended up transitioning well into predicting unseen data on the testing set. However, there is still a point of concern for why the model performed as well as it did, and it involves the difference between a single-step and a multi-step time series projection. The model that has been built so far is a single-step time series projection model, since it uses several inputs to generate one output. However, consider if the trained model were to be a multi-step time series projection, in which case would also take several inputs and produce more than one output. There would without a doubt be different results.", "A common method of creating a multi-step time series projection is through a recursive approach, which involves making a single projection and appending it to the next set of inputs to predict the subsequent time step.", "However, it also introduces the issue of propagating early errors into future projections; prediction errors from periods t and t+1 will carry over to subsequent periods. Hence, if a single prediction is to be inaccurate to some degree, there is a good chance of the next chain of values becoming increasingly erroneous, as the wrong values will be used as future inputs. As a result, a multi-step time series projection model has the potential to degenerate over longer forecast horizons because of error propagation.", "In the case of the single-step model used in this report, even if a prediction were to completely deviate away from the actual value, there is a strong chance of subsequent predictions being brought back to course by the actual values.", "Then again, this point of concern should not completely discredit the accuracy of the model. As mentioned before, the model performed well in capturing sixty data points as an input to generate one output, that would on average only deviate $0.19 on training data and $0.41 on unseen data. Hence, even in the case of a recursive multi-step time series projection, predictions based on the model should be fairly accurate up to a certain period in the future, most likely less than sixty points forward.", "There is some merit in forecasting the stock market, especially through a method as powerful as machine learning. The findings of the report demonstrate that in the case of a single-step time series projection problem, using a LSTM network can generate results with good accuracy, 94.2% to be more specific. The explanation to this could perhaps be because while the Efficient-market Hypothesis may hold true over a long span of time, it does not fully explain the short-term behavior of a security\u2019s price. As aforementioned, behavioral finance exhibits the fact that the stock market is largely driven by irrational investor decisions and economic trends; case in point, the huge dip in MSFT\u2019s stock prices in 2020 due to COVID-19. Thus, to a great degree, understanding the behavior of a stock market can be viewed as a sequential problem.", "Then again, the findings of the report are also somewhat limited. It only really investigates the behavior of a sequence, hence, it fails to establish relational links between various other factors and a security\u2019s price. Hence, if the model was to continually be used in the future, there may be many instances of it generating completely flawed predictions, in the face of unforeseen events. In addition, there is also the issue with the findings being based on a single step time series projection model. It would be interesting to see what kind of results a multi-step series projection model would yield and how it would answer this report\u2019s research question. If any improvements are to be made in the future, these two considerations are the main candidates for refinement.", "To fully conclude this report, a fifteen-day forecast of MSFT\u2019s price, starting from its most recent trading date, is performed using the recursive multi-step time series projection method. The number fifteen is settled on as it is less than half the value of \u2018rolling\u2019 (time step). Hence, the previously built, LSTM model is retrained using all of MSFT\u2019s historic data with no splits.", "After the model has been trained, a loop is created to take in new single outputs as future inputs and generate subsequent outputs.", "A new function to add \u2019n\u2019 new business days to forecast \u2019n\u2019 amount of prices is constructed.", "A new data frame just for the price projections is constructed after creating the new forward date index.", "Your home for data science.
