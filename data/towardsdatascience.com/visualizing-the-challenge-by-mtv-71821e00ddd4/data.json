Fellow newcomer, Theo Campbell, placed 2nd as the last man standing from the British Alliance while Challenge vet Wes Bergmann came trudging in at 3rd.", "There is loads of history in 33 seasons of action, and the best way to tell that story is visually, through data. Indeed, a quick glance through the MediaWiki page of any challenger gives a comprehensive overview of their history including total prize money, all the way down to their hometown.", "Furthermore, on Wikipedia, there\u2019s a list of the top 28 grossing challengers of all time, so this post is essentially a panoramic view of all 28 MediaWiki pages at the same time.", "If you\u2019re on a mobile device now would be a good time to switch to landscape view to fully enjoy the interactive experience of the plots. Do feel free to touch any of the green dots.", "Double-tap a graph to reset. Cheers!", "Indeed just up until a few seasons ago, The Challenge had featured almost entirely American casts, so much so that only 3 of the MediaWiki stated hometowns are not in the USA. Those with non-american hometowns in the top 28 grossing are :", "As expected, the rest of the top 28 indeed have hometowns in the USA especially in the north eastern region. This is not to say that they are all American born though, as an example we might take Camila who is Brazilian born. This heavily American top 28 is possibly going to change somewhat in coming years as both War of the Worlds and War of the Worlds 2 contain half American and UK casts. Furthermore, the latter of the two competitions is set up to be a battle between Team USA and Team UK.", "In War of The Worlds, every week the top 3 performing teams (or individuals depending on the challenge) formed \u201cThe Tribunal\u201d where they voted one of the remaining teams onto \u201cThe Killing Floor\u201d to compete for their stay in the competition. The team selected was expected to then choose any other team to compete against as long as they were not a part of The Tribunal. The losing team went home and the winning team carried on:", "Though the format changes per season of the challenge, this is what generally constitutes an elimination round.", "From here we can see that Wes may stand out as the Eliminations Champ amongst the top 28 grossing challengers with 14 wins and just 6 losses across a lengthy 11 seasons. Arguably, there is perhaps an even better record standing with Jordan an amazing 5 wins and 1 loss in his 4 seasons.", "In the ladies, we see that Cara Maria (13 Wins, 6 Losses, 13 seasons) and Camila (9 wins, 4 Losses, 10 seasosns) have very formidable records.", "Most spectacularly however is Laurel\u2019s record sitting at a phenomenal 9 wins and 1 loss in just 4 seasons.", "It is most clear however, that our dear Johnny Bananas (Johnny Devenanzio) has the worst eliminations record of all, consisting of just 8 wins and 12 losses accumulating across his 18 seasons.", "The prize money from the challenge has greatly increased over the years. In earlier competitions the last challenger remaining took home just over 100k. However, these numbers have been steadily growing up to Turbo\u2019s grand winnings of 750k. This has immediately propelled him to 2nd on the list of top grossing challengers of all time. Indeed, for the majority of challengers,after spending up to 10 seasons have generally earned between 100k \u2014 300k.", "Here\u2019s a different look of the spread of the total money won, across the Male and Female competitors. This is testimony to the fairness of the challenge, where there is no clear distinction between the monetary success of the male and female challengers amongst the top 28 grossing competitors of all time.", "Here we see that Mike \u201cThe Miz\u201d Mizanin has the most followers by a nautical mile, raking in over 3M. Indeed this shows the power that the World Wrestling Entertainment scene has in developing a social media following. Additionally, the Miz also has somewhat of an extensive filmography, mainly in Direct-to-Video productions. Furthermore he has hosted the charity season Champs vs Stars in 2017, and has also hosted the reunion episode of The Challenge on several different seasons.", "As shown in earlier graphs Bananas has attended the most challenges of anyone in history (18), since his introduction in The Duel way back in 2006. His MTV debut however, was The Real World: Key West. He is currently the host of NBC\u2019s 1st Look.", "Undoubtedly, Bananas follows closely behind the Miz \u2014 I kid \u2014 clocking in at a recent milestone of about 300k followers.", "This is probably the most shocking graph of all, that Derrick K has the most tweets despite only creating an account in 2016! Derrick is often the quietest person on the show, only ever speaking to reinforce his focus on the grand prize,which he intends to use to provide a better life for his family. On twitter however he does seem to be quite active, racking up over 17k tweets in his 3 years\u2014 I\u2019m impressed.", "I hope you enjoyed the read and are excited to watch season 34!", "I myself am a final year Mathematical Finance Undergrad that really enjoys sharing my learning curve with the world. \u2014 that being said I\u2019m most definitely open to any suggestions, corrections or any general feedback that comes to mind as you peruse through the post.", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn \u2014", "I am in no way affiliated with MTV and this is unofficial data scraped from MediaWiki.", "Your home for data science.
