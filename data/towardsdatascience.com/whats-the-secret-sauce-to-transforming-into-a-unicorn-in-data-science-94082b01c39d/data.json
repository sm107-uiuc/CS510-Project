But what role does this exactly refer to? The very mention of this title conjures up images of math wizards sweating it out in multivariate calculus and linear algebra, or of geeks coding to create the next general artificial intelligence.", "And then, one is also thrust upon with busy Venn diagrams that call for mastery of a laundry list of skills. These add up to areas that a team of people may have mastered amongst them, over the years. Data scientist is a loosely used term, a title that\u2019s heavily abused in the industry. Quite like Big Data or, say AI.", "In practice, the title is often used as an umbrella term for related roles and is variously interpreted by companies in the industry. I\u2019ve come across many people who\u2019ve confessed to me in private, \u201cGive me any job and role, but please coin me a job title with some play of these 2 words \u2014 \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018scientist\u2019!", "Fuelled by such confusion, people wonder whether they must learn programming to have a go at a career in data science. For others, statistics or machine learning may not be their cup of tea. These then appear to be stumbling blocks for making any advances into the analytics field.", "This particularly perplexes laterals who have developed an interest in data, but, say have 10 years in an unrelated role, in a different industry. The assumption of having to learn coding or design afresh to restart their career stumps them. These misconceptions must be forcefully put to rest, lest they continue crushing dreams of a career in data science.", "So, what\u2019s a realistic expectation of the skills needed to make a career in data science? And, can aspirants pick and choose skills of interest to carve out a preferred role, one that builds on strengths, while also being in demand?", "We\u2019ll first present the spectrum of skills that are needed in data science, like a buffet menu. Then we\u2019ll construct the key industry roles that deliver analytics value, by picking and choosing from amongst these skills, like a customized meal. And yes, we\u2019ll also unwrap the secret sauce to becoming a unicorn in this industry.", "There are 5 skills that are central to data science. To emphasize this again, no, one doesn\u2019t need to learn them all. We\u2019ll cover the roles and the mix of skills that each role entails, in the next section. First, let's talk about the complete listing of competencies needed in a project, in order to deliver business value.", "Passion for numbers is a pre-condition for success in data science, and a great asset. One must pick up data wrangling skills to get a feel for data \u2014 compute averages, fit cross tabs and extract basic insights through exploratory analysis. It\u2019s the approach that matters and any tool, say Excel, R or SQL will do.", "Insights from the analysis and results of data techniques are like an unpolished diamond. They are valuable to a trained eye, but worthless in a marketplace. It's invaluable to pick up the presentation and basic design skills to polish those nuggets of insights. This makes one\u2019s efforts effective and worthwhile.", "Data handling and basic design must be topped up with a good orientation of a chosen domain. Techniques with data are only as good as their adaptation to a business problem. This basic knowledge can\u2019t be outsourced to a business analyst, so anyone serious about data science should pick up domain basics.", "In short, this skill requires one to befriend data and train their eyes to spot patterns in numbers. This is a fundamental skill that is non-negotiable in analytics.", "Information design is the presentation of data in a way that fosters effective and efficient understanding. The emphasis is on visual design that enables the consumption of data, rather than just beautification. Visualization is the last mile of communication that enables users to get value from analytics.", "To become an expert in this area, one must master the design skills spanning the realms of interaction design, user experience, and data visualization. This calls for expertise in user mapping, information architecture, data representation, wireframing, high fidelity design and visual aesthetics.", "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see \u2014 John Tukey", "In most data science courses, this area is devoted a lion\u2019s share of attention. The focus here is on statistics and modeling, while scripting or programming is a secondary skill. While this is a key area for extraction of value from data, an over-emphasis here may take the focus off other 4 key skills in data science.", "Building upon the basic data wrangling skills, one must dive in deeper into statistics, probability and then branch out into the techniques and algorithms in machine learning. Deep learning and other trending AI techniques fall into this bucket as well, but these call for more extensive coding skills.", "People with a core programming background have great use in data science, and it\u2019s not mandatory for them to pick up machine learning skills. Data applications call for backend coding to connect and handle data, need heavy lifting with data processing and building out the internals of data science apps.", "There are also strong needs for front-end coding skills to showcase the data insights to users, which is where the rubber really meets the road. One must master the processing and presentation of data onto a variety of UI and form factors. Languages like Python, Java, Javascript, R, SQL are popular.", "Deep domain skills help bring in meaning, interpretability, and actionability to analytics. The importance of blending domain expertise with data skills cannot be overemphasized. Lack of sufficient attention in this area throughout a project is the most common cause of failure for initiatives.", "Picking up the depth in a chosen domain and mastering the business flows is the first step here. One must then focus on data-literacy and a conceptual understanding of analytical techniques. This brings in the know-how to weave a tight fabric by combining domain skills with data chops, for superior value.", "\u201cIf you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing. \u2014 W. Edward Deming\u201d", "Now that we\u2019ve seen the spread of skills, these combine to form the following 4 core roles in analytics. These roles can be found in every shop that is serious about data science offerings. They are usually carved out as separate roles as described here or are blended into some overlapping combinations.", "Given the evolving state of the industry, the job designations are fairly fluid. While we\u2019ve seen that \u2018data scientist\u2019 is a loosely used title often to attract talent, what a role like \u2018Data ninja\u2019 may mean is anybody\u2019s guess! Here, I\u2019ve used titles closer to those we\u2019ve evolved over the past 7 years, at Gramener.", "Folks who combine the data bootstrap skills with deep programming (front-end, back-end or full-stack) fall under this title. These roles are critical in application programming, integration and cloud implementations of data science applications. Apart from deep coding skills, this calls for mastery in processing data, automating insights and end-to-end app implementations. Some organizations show data scientist as a senior role in this career path.", "These are people who top up the core data chops with skills in statistics and machine learning. While they are the authority in devising the analytics approach and building out models, they leverage their basic programming skills and domain orientation to implement and evaluate model interpretability.", "Designers with core UI and UX skills, who also bring in a strong grounding in fundamental data skills fit the bill of Information Designer. They play an important role from conceptualization to creation of data stories. Keeping users at the center of the universe, they iteratively drive the design of visual intelligence layer.", "Functional data consultants act as a bridge between business users and the data science team, by combining their domain mastery with the essential data skills. Acting as a strong influence in the team, they onboard clients on data-driven use cases, while keeping the analytics solution business-driven and actionable.", "These 4 key roles in data science show how people from varied backgrounds \u2014 programming, statistics, design, and domain, can transform their innate skills into an influential role in analytics projects. It\u2019s the strong fundamentals topped up with a passion for data and business application, that makes them invaluable to organizations.", "If quality practitioners in these 4 roles are highly sought after in the industry, and in short supply, what then makes a Unicorn in data science? What is that magical mix that can make a person invaluable?", "Re-picturing our data science buffet menu, this superior ability is born when one can check off any 3 skills from here, with an exceptional level of mastery in each. As the saying goes, it always looks easier in hindsight. Let's go over a few skill mixes and see the areas where these people can be irreplaceable.", "As you can see above, the addition of just one more data science skill with a high level of expertise can serve to transform a person\u2019s role. This has a much bigger effect by catapulting a person\u2019s ability, contribution, and value out of the park.", "You may ask, what if you can rack up 4 or more of these skills? Well, then consider yourself a demi-God in data science. Or, as the famous MasterCard campaign goes, your value in the Data Science industry becomes \u2018Truly Priceless !\u2019.", "Data science projects need a combination of key skills in order to be successful in solving a client\u2019s problem. Often, company job descriptions for a single position may call out most or all of these skills. Given the huge spread of candidate abilities, this is just an attempt to get as much of overlap as possible.", "One man doesn\u2019t make a team. It takes eleven. \u2014 Bear Bryant, legendary football coach", "In reality, project teams are dynamically staffed with a varying mix of roles based on the core skill levels of people. There could be analytics initiatives that manage to get this mix amongst 3 people, while others might onboard 5. Usually, organizations prefer smaller teams with interdisciplinary skills, for better coordination and more effective outcomes.", "Don\u2019t people enter the industry without the suggested breadth of base data skills, or with a lack of depth in a key skill area? Yes, but then their level of contributions is a shade of the others, and it all comes down to a matter of surviving versus flourishing, in the data science field.", "The deeper a candidate\u2019s competence in two or more of the above skill areas, the better prepared will the person be to make impacting contributions. This consequently translates to higher perceived value and hence much better negotiating power in interviews. To up the game further, one needs to consciously pick another skill and invest in oneself by going really deeper.", "For the best return on your money, pour your purse into your head. \u2014 Benjamin Franklin", "If you found this interesting, you will enjoy these related articles I wrote:", "Passionate about data science?
