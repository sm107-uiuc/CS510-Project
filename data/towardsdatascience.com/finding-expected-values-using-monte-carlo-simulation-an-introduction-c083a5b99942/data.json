I hope this article will enable you to solve the same questions with a different approach, equipping you with another trick up your sleeve if you struggle to solve the problem analytically.", "But first, what are Monte Carlo (MC) methods? According to Wikipedia,", "\u201cMonte Carlo methods, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.\u201d", "Let us try and understand MC further with an easy but practical problem. How would one estimate the value of \u03c0 using MC?", "Intuitively, one can see that the accuracy increases as we increase the number of points that we scatter over the surface of the square. The ratio approaches \u03c0/4 for an infinite number of points.", "This puzzle is formulated from the famous idiom about how a camel buckles under the seemingly minor additional weight of the last straw.", "Mathematically, suppose straws are being placed on a camel\u2019s back one by one. The weight of the straw is equally likely to be any real value between 0 to 1. The camel\u2019s back breaks when the weight of the straws exceeds 1. Find the expected value of the weight of the last straw.", "You may be thinking, will the expected weight of the last straw be any different from 0.5, which is the expected value for the weight of a single straw. The answer is yes because heavier straws are more likely to break the camel\u2019s back than lighter ones. Hence, intuitively, the expected weight of the last straw is greater than 0.5.", "Before moving further, try and solve this problem analytically and see if you can reach the correct answer.", "Using Python, let us simulate breaking the camel\u2019s back by adding straws to its back.", "Disclaimer: No camels were harmed while simulating this puzzle.", "Define function break_camel_back() to return the weight of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and expected_weight_of_last_straw(n) that simulates breaking the camel\u2019s back n times and returns the average weight of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back each time. For large values of n, the output of this function is the answer to our question.", "It can be seen that for large values (2\u00b9\u2079 in this case), the expected value approaches a value of around 0.64, in line with our intuition.", "The exact expected value is 2-e/2, which is approximately 0.640859 (Kudos to those who solved it successfully analytically). Don\u2019t worry if you couldn\u2019t solve it analytically, you can find the solution here.", "Additional Exercise: Tweak the code to find the expected number of straws that break the camel\u2019s back for the same weight distribution.(The answer is e)", "Find the expected value for the number of flips you\u2019ll need to make in order to see the pattern \u2018TXT\u2019 , where T is tails, and X is either heads or tails.", "(You will keep flipping the coin until you observe either TTT or THT and count the number of coin tosses you made)", "Define the function coin_toss() which simulates tossing a coin with help of choice from the random library.

The application of these methods is not just limited to probability puzzles but spans the fields of Finance, Computational Biology, Data Science, Engineering, and even Law!", "Let me know what your thoughts are in the comments, or what you would like to see me elaborate more on.", "I would recommend beginners to start here.", "Your home for data science.
