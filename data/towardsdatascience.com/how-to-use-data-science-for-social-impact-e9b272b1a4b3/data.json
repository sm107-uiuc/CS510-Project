If used correctly, it grants access to:", "Utilizing Data comes in many forms. Netflix uses data science to recommend movies and tv shows to customers. Facebook uses data science to create targeted advertisements. Google uses data science to optimize search results. Amazon uses data science to have conversations with Alexa. Microsoft uses data science to create virtual realities.", "Kaggle is using data science to predict poverty levels to identify where the highest need is for social welfare assistance. Code for Africa is using data science to create a tool that helps Kenyan citizens show up to the ballot box informed and ready to vote. DataKind is using data science to create more streamlined paths out of homelessness.", "There\u2019s a distinct difference between these two groups of data science users. The former utilize data for revenue. The latter utilize data for social impact.", "How can we continue to leverage data science for social impact?", "Defined by the Open Knowledge Foundation :", "\u201cOpen data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone.\u201d", "It\u2019s clear that data science relies on data collection before anything else. There is no data cleaning, data analysis, or data utilization without data. The social impact projects from Kaggle, Code for Africa, and DataKind are fantastic, but they wouldn\u2019t have been possible without access to data.", "Kaggle couldn\u2019t have begun predicting poverty if IDB didn\u2019t give them their household income data. Code for Africa couldn\u2019t have created any tools if the Independent Electoral & Boundaries Commission hadn\u2019t released their location data on voter registration centers.", "This is precisely why open data is the key to creating a social impact through data science. The more data that is available, the more opportunity there is to utilize it.", "I\u2019ll admit, there\u2019s a bit of a dichotomy when it comes to open data. It\u2019s a precarious balancing act between transparency and security.", "I\u2019ve already shared my thoughts about the need for data privacy. It\u2019s important to address the potential misuses of open data before reaching a point of no-return. The Cambridge Analytica, Strava, and Equifax scandals clearly outlined why opening data can be bad.", "This is why it must be done correctly.", "It isn\u2019t a good idea for Facebook to suddenly open up their databases for public access. It\u2019s an equally bad idea for Google to share all of their private user information. To be clear, open data isn\u2019t meant for all platforms.", "The best use of open data is between governments and their people.", "Buenos Aires uses their open data platform to inform the public about what the government is doing. They\u2019ve made interesting reports with data visualizations to present important information to their citizens. They even created an interactive tool to help the public understand how the government allocates funds for the quarterly budget.", "\u201cThe budget reflects what the State does with the resources it obtains from all citizens.

While there are some important problems with predictive policing that will need to be addressed before this system is adopted by governments, the National University in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia is already working on a three year plan to utilize data to police the city more efficiently. The goal is to reduce crime.", "When data becomes public, it is easier to share harsh realities with large audiences. Vox is a great example of a platform that provides information to the public through data visualization. In this story, Vox used data from entities in the USA to raise awareness about gun violence.", "Remember that data science provides an \u201cability to understand the world in an objective way\u201d.

Open data provides the public access to the source of information, which allows everyone to draw their own conclusions.", "This tool is a great example of how violence can be visualized objectively in the city of Cali. Data visualizations lead to public awareness.", "When governments are forced to open their data, it becomes harder to hide corruption. Some examples of this:", "Figure 2 outlines this process.

Collaboration allows governments to work with their citizens to create progress.", "Progress builds trust between people and their government.", "Trust is incredibly important for countries with a history of corruption. The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of a country is an annually collected index that measures how corrupt citizens perceive their government to be. CPI is directly correlated to per capita GDP.", "When citizens trust that their government is less corrupt, GDP rises. Just one unit of gained CPI has been proven to increase average per capita GDP by 1.7% annually. Perception of corruption is highly influential in developing economies.", "TLDR: building trust between governments and citizens is very important. Open data helps to do this.", "The major obstacle for open data is that it only works when everyone participates. I discuss this issue further in this article.", "The hard reality of organizations like DataKind, Code for Africa, or Kaggle is that most social impact projects depend on volunteer work. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to monetize projects that make a difference.", "The good news is that the tools for change are right at our fingertips. Open data platforms are growing.
