However, there are a lot of variables that we need to consider for a real-life scenario.", "During this unfortunate COVID period we are dealing with a huge inflow of e-commerce orders from a variety of customers scattered throughout a city, country or even the entire world then a humongous number of variables come into the play which simply cannot be solved using conventional methods in a practical amount of time. With the recent developments in AI, machine learning and cloud data the entire game of route optimization has begun to change. AI is continuously retrieving data, learning from it, and searching for improved methods to ensure the most optimal routes for the drivers.", "In this series we will be traversing through an amazing journey of learning Multi-Objective Route Optimization starting from the linear methods to advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning :", "1. Vehicle Routing Problem and Multi-Objective Optimization", "5. MILP based approaches using CPLEX-python", "In this blog, we will be diving into the detailed description of the Vehicle Routing Problem with some added constraints, the concept of Multi-Objective Optimisation and a brief overview of the methods that this series will feature.", "Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) can be defined as a problem of finding the optimal routes of delivery or collection from one or several depots to a number of customers while satisfying some constraints. This problem can be extended to the collection of garbage in a society, gasoline delivery trucks, goods and mail delivery etc, the applications are limitless.", "In classical VRP, the location of the customers and depots are known in advance this facilitates us to determine the routes among the aforementioned. For a simplified definition of the problem let us consider a graph G=(V, A) where V={1\u2026\u2026n} is a set of vertices (customers) with the depot located at vertex 1, and A is the set of arcs (routes). In addition to this, we assume a certain number of vehicles available at the depot allocating an initial cost to each one of them. These vehicles cover the routes between the customers in such a way that:", "(i) each city is visited exactly once by one vehicle", "(ii) all the vehicle routes start and end at the depot", "However in all fairness to the above problem, though including several variables and instructions still lacks a fair sense of realism to be applied directly anywhere and hence we move on to a more generalised form of the VRP called the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problem or VRPTW( Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows). Our objective here is to optimize the use of a fleet of vehicles that must make several stops to serve a set of customers and to specify which customers should be served by each vehicle and in what order to minimize the cost, subject to vehicle capacity and service time restrictions.", "Hence above definition can be modified into digraph G=(V, E) consisting of a set of n customers + 1 depot, each of which can be reached only within a specified time interval or time window, and a set E of arcs with non-negative weights representing travel distances. Each vehicle has a maximum vehicle capacity of Q and all the customers have a request service size of qi", "Now the task in hand after defining the problem is to optimize the routes traveresed by the vehicles to obtain the least cost. However, before we jump into that let us get familiar with the concept of Multi-Objective Optimisation. It is an area of multiple-criteria decision making, concerning mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimised simultaneously. It is mainly used in places when we have objectives that are conflicting with each other and the optimal decision lies in between their trade-offs. Another consequence of Multi-Objective Optimization in contrast to single-objective is we obtain a set of optimal solutions instead of a single solution, all of this blends together to make the Multi-Objective approach more suitable for real-world scenarios.", "The objectives that we will be considering in our scenario in the number of vehicles allocated for the task and total cost required in traversing the route. The time delay will be taken care of in the cost function with an additional delay cost. The above graph summarises the entire process into two parts .i.e. generation of initial random solutions, converging these to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions. This process is repeated until the Pareto optimal set is obtained.", "The VRP might not seem very difficult to solve at a first glance as one can always follow the brute-force approach to solve the problem by determining all the possible routes and pick the least expensive one. What\u2019s wrong with this approach then? It turns out this process is called enumeration and is only feasible for very small problems. VRP is reported to be an NP-hard problem which means that solution time increases astronomically with size. The number of possible solutions for VRP is in orders of n! , this factorial growth is responsible for the huge increase in time. Below is a table showing the estimated time to solve the VRP by a computer processing a billion computations per second.", "Most real-world problems involve a larger number of customers, hence we need to divert to other methods like Metaheuristics to solve the problem. These are derived from \u2018heuristics\u2019 which means finding by trial and error and \u2018meta\u2019- a higher level or beyond. These methods use a trade-off between generating randomisation and local search. Quality of solutions is comprised for a faster time. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this method will provide us with an optimal solution. The two major components of a metaheuristics algorithm are exploration and exploitation. The former is deals with the generation of diverse solutions to explore the search space on a global scale, whereas the latter is responsible for searching a local region knowing that a good solution exists in the region. Finding a good trade-off between the two results in a good algorithmic convergence and gives solutions which are closest to the global optimum", "Another such method which can solve this NP-hard problem is Reinforcement Learning. There have been huge developments in this field in recent times especially after the success achieved by Deepmind through there AlphaZero program. A generic RL model consists of three main parts namely:- state, agent and environment. The model uses a series of rewards and punishments as signals for positive or negative behaviour for the actions taken by the agent at a given state in a particular environment. The main goal of the agent becomes to maximise the total cumulative reward. The figure below illustrates the action-feedback loop of an RL model:", "The entire tutorial is carried out using the Solomon Dataset, it consists of three different kinds of customer distributions;", "The customers have been distributed randomly across the entire city with the vehicle originating from the depot. This is equivalent to the different stores in a city where it required to deliver the goods.", "(ii) Clustered or the C Type", "This is an interesting case where particular clusters of data are randomly distributed throughout the city like organised localities and societies in a city for door-to-door delivery or essential services like garbage collection.", "(iii) Randomised & Clustered or the RC type.", "This particular kind is a combination of both the above methods where the geographical locations are distributed in both a clustered and randomised form.", "These are further divided into two sub-categories short scheduling and long scheduling depending on the length of their time windows", "After a detailed description of the problem that we are facing with VRP, and a brief overview of the methods that this series will feature, turn on towards the next part of the series where we will discuss in-depth our first metaheuristic approach: Genetic Algorithm. Here we will dwell into the details of the applied framework and go through the detailed explanation of the individual steps of selection, mutation and crossover.", "Sincere thanks to Sarnath K, Subarna Rana and Ravi Ranjan for their mentorship on this project and special thanks to Ravi Ranjan for the inspiration in this series.", "Your home for data science.
