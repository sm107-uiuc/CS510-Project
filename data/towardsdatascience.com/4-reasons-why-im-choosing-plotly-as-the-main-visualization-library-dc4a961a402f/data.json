This article is purely based on personal experience and is aimed to help you with choosing a perfect visualization library for your project.", "With that being said, let\u2019s jump into the reasons why you\u2019re here.", "Now, you\u2019ll consider this as a benefit only if you know Python already \u2014 but since you\u2019re reading a Data Science blog I\u2019m assuming you are.", "Python\u2019s syntax is clear, clean, and easy to use, and Plotly is no exception. Just take a look at how little code is needed to produce a simple bubble chart:", "Running this code will produce a visually appealing chart shown below:", "It\u2019s not a secret that I\u2019m a fan of Python syntax, but if you aren\u2019t, you can still use Plotly with R and JavaScript. Nevertheless, let\u2019s proceed to the next point.", "If you\u2019ve followed the first point and executed the provided code, then you\u2019re already aware that visualizations in Plotly are interactive.", "Maybe that\u2019s not a huge thing to you if you\u2019re coming from a JavaScript background, but it\u2019s a huge thing for anyone coming from Python. Visualizations made through Matplotlib are not interactive, and look pretty much worse by default than default visualizations from Plotly.", "You don\u2019t need to specify that you want your chart to be interactive, but you sure can tweak what is visible on hover.", "More on that in later articles, there are many more to come in this Plotly series.", "Your Plotly chart will have a Figure object, populated with:", "As you might figure, you\u2019ll put the data which makes the charts in the data, and in layout you\u2019ll specify how the chart should look like. Let\u2019s take a look at an example.", "Let\u2019s make a few imports first:", "Now let\u2019s define the data which will go into the chart:", "That\u2019s it. This will create a scatter plot from random integers on both the x-axis and the y-axis. Now let\u2019s define the layout:", "And now let\u2019s put everything into a Figure object and plot it:", "If you ask me that was as clean as data visualization can be. If you were to take this code, put it in a single .py script and run it, the visualization would be saved as a html file and automatically opened in your browser:", "Not too shabby, but we\u2019ll dive much deeper into styling in the following articles.", "If you know some basic HTML and CSS then it\u2019s very easy to incorporate multiple charts into a single, good-looking dashboard.", "Plotly charts can be incorporated with Dash, a framework for building web applications.", "Here\u2019s a paragraph from the official documentation:", "Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It\u2019s particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.", "This React part will transform your app into a Single Page Application, meaning that there won\u2019t be those awkward refreshes upon clicking on stuff. And all of this without knowing any web development. Awesome.", "We won\u2019t dive into dashboard development now, but few articles down the road will cover it in depth.", "If you can\u2019t wait to see what can be produced with Dash, here\u2019s the official gallery:", "I\u2019m perfectly fine with looking at the tabular data. But a big part of my job is presenting findings and conclusion to others, and every single time showing a chart will be a far more effective method.", "In the next month or so I\u2019ve decided to publish 10-ish articles that will cover Plotly and Dash front to back, making sure that data visualization won\u2019t be a painful process to you in the future.", "Thanks for reading and stay tuned.", "Loved the article?
