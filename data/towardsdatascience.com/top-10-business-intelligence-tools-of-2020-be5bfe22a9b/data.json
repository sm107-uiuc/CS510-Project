You can literally pull in any data you\u2019d like from a Google Sheet.", "Cons: Does not really help good to pull a big selection of pre-built connectors for data from other sources. Requires a lot to make working with a wide range of data types easy.", "As for visualization and analysis capabilities, Data Studio offers a fair number of options compared to other analytics suites. One other potential drawback of Data Studio is the fact that it\u2019s entirely web-based.

Spotfire comes with the same general visualization capabilities as Tableau or QlikView.", "While Tableau Public and Power BI Desktop is free to use, TIBCO Spotfire pricing starts at $650.00 per year, per user.
