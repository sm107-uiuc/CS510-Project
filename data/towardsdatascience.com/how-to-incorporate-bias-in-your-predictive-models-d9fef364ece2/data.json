Despite the abundance of top quality machine learning (ML) practitioners and technological advancements, there is no dearth of real-life ML failures.", "Let us first revisit these high-profile ML and AI failures where an underlying biased model was one, if not the predominant, reason for their failure, before going over certain sources of bias that can impact your predictive models.", "UK students did not sit for their GCSE and A-Levels exams this year due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Instead, the UK exam regulator, Ofqual, utilized an algorithm to determine a student\u2019s expected grades based on its:", "However, what transpired on the results day, August 13 was a complete meltdown: nearly 40% of A-Levels grades were lower than teachers\u2019 assessments. This caused a considerable uproar, resulting in a government u-turn on August 17, whereby it was announced that the student grades would be revised to reflect the higher of the original teacher\u2019s assessment and the model output.", "In October 2013, IBM partnered with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) to develop an AI-powered solution to cure cancer based on its Watson supercomputer. However, it failed to live up to its expectations.", "Forbes reported in February 2017 that MD Anderson benched its Watson for Oncology project and was actively looking for other partners to replace IBM and continue with its future research. Later in July 2018, a report by STAT revealed, based on an analysis of internal IBM documents, multiple counts of downright erroneous cancer treatment advice by Watson and that several customers reported \u201cmultiple examples of unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations\u201d.", "Amazon\u2019s engineers started working on an automated recruitment tool in 2014 to review job aspirants\u2019 resumes. However, Reuters reported in 2018 that by 2015 \u201cthe company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way\u201d.", "Apparently, the model was trained on ten years worth of job applications that were predominantly from men, indicative of male dominance in the tech industry then. The project was subsequently shelved, and the team disbanded in early 2017.", "Specific ML models can be biased in a subtle way, others not so \u2014 as seen above. Some of the potential reasons for a biased model include:", "Biased training data will eventuate in a biased model \u2014 the GIGO adage! This was evident in the Amazon example above, where a shortage of female applicants in the training data forced the model to give advantage to male applicants. The model did not have sufficiently gender-impartial data to train on and learn from. The data often reflects the status quo and the current bias in society (for better or for worse).", "Appropriate data collection and sampling strategies are of paramount importance to ensure the availability of relevant, representative, suitable, and sufficiently diverse data. There is a reason why 80% of a data scientist\u2019s work revolves around data collection and feature engineering.", "ML algorithms have their own inherent biases due to their various mathematical and statistical assumptions that have nothing to do with the underlying training data. Biased algorithms are more rigid, assume and require a tightly defined data distribution, and are more resistant to noise in the data. However, they can have difficulty in learning data complexities. In contract, algorithms with a low bias can handle more complex data but generally do not adapt well to data in production.", "This conflicting situation is usually referred to as the bias/variance trade-off. It requires a delicate balancing act by the ML practitioner to ensure optimum bias (and by definition, also variance).", "This occurs when we exclude specific features or variables from the dataset on an incorrect presumption that they not useful for the prediction problem on hand without validating that assumption first.", "Always test the correlation between predictors and the target variable before discarding any features. Some of these feature selection strategies for various variable types were covered in one of my previous articles.", "Erroneous measurement, e.g., by a device, can result in a systematic distortion of data and measurement bias. For example, if a weighing device consistently under-reports weights by the same amount, any model that utilizes the resultant data from this faulty device will not be accurate. Improperly designed surveys with \u2018leading\u2019 questions are another usual source of measurement bias.", "Observer bias happens when the data collection or feature engineering strategies are influenced by the data analyst\u2019s preconceived, often false, notions. For example, in case I am biased against Sydneysiders (which I am not), then I might allow my bias to creep into my data in subconscious ways. A classic example of observer bias was The Burt Affair.", "It is often challenging to detect observer bias, but it can be prevented through a combination of training and screening strategies together with clearly defined and implemented policies and procedures.", "Consider an ML model that somehow influences the generation of data that is then used by it for predictions. As a result, the model will make predictions that are biased to the data that it had a say on. However, such feedback loops can also be a design feature and not necessarily a cause for concern \u2014 usually in content personalization and recommender systems.", "Drift in this context refers to changes over time to a system or application that generates data used for modeling. For example, a change to the business definition of delayed payments (in case of a default prediction problem) or the addition of new modes of user interaction.", "Such bias is the easiest to prevent and detect through appropriate change management and error tracking practices together with regular model updates and training.", "The above are some of the potential sources of bias that can have an impact on the performance of your predictive model. In my experience, the majority of the above can be adequately handled through evaluating and then re-evaluating data collection and sampling strategies, and thorough testing/validation routines.", "Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to discuss anything related to data analytics, machine learning, financial or credit analysis.", "Your home for data science.
