It has MANY applications including speech recognition, automated chatbots, sentiment analysis, and more.", "Below are several high-quality courses on Natural Language Processing that are FREE:", "If you\u2019re looking for an introduction to NLP, this course is it. Keep in mind that this course was made even for those who don\u2019t have any experience in Python, hence the tutorial on Python. Personally, I feel like this definitely covers a lot on theoretically, but there are definitely other courses out there that are better for applications.", "This course covers the basics on text processing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, chatbots, and more. I highly recommend this course if you are new to programming or know absolutely nothing about NLP.", "This course is also from Stanford but it is a little more advanced. You\u2019re expected to be proficient in Python and have a good understanding of basic calculus, statistics, and machine learning. This course is more math-heavy, so make sure that you have a good understanding of vectors and matrices.", "Keep in mind that a big portion of the course focuses on vectors, matrix calculus, and neural networks because these concepts make up the foundation of a lot of NLP concepts. So if you don\u2019t feel like you have the mathematical skills required, I recommend that you start with the first course above.", "Quoted by them, this is an advanced course on NLP.", "\u201cThis will be an applied course focussing on recent advances in analysing and generating speech and text using recurrent neural networks. We will introduce the mathematical definitions of the relevant machine learning models and derive their associated optimisation algorithms. The course will cover a range of applications of neural networks in NLP including analysing latent dimensions in text, transcribing speech to text, translating between languages, and answering questions.\u201d", "Similar to the second course, this course has a heavy emphasis on neural networks, and so, it is highly recommended that you understanding fundamental linear algebra, continuous mathematics, and probability concepts. This course is also very practical and application-heavy, so you should also be a proficient programmer.", "This is a unique course that initially focuses on things that aren\u2019t normally focused on, like Hidden Markov Models, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars, and more. The latter half of the course primarily focuses on vectors and neural networks.", "Personally, I feel like the course material provides nice summaries for certain topics, like neural networks. However, with a like of assignments/practicals, I feel like this is more of a resource that you could use to skim or refresh your memory.", "This is a graduate course that is quite extensive. It emphasizes the use of scikit-learn, keras, gensim, and spacy. In terms of raw theory, this course has top-tier slides and extra readings to further your knowledge. It also covers several topics that some of the courses above don\u2019t.", "The only unfortunate thing is that they don\u2019t share any of their assignments/practicals or quizzes, so there aren\u2019t any opportunities for you to put your knowledge to the test.", "Quoted from them, \u201cTopics include text-driven forecasting and prediction (using text for problems involving classification or regression); experimental design; the representation of text, including features derived from linguistic structure (such as parts of speech, named entities, syntax, and coreference) and features derived from low-dimensional representations of words, sentences and documents; exploring textual similarity for the purpose of clustering; information extraction (extracting relations between entities mentioned in text); and human-in-the-loop interactive NLP.\u201d", "I hope that you find a course that suits your needs and I wish you the best in your data science journey.", "Your home for data science.
