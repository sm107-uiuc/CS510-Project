You get access to customized learning experience because the technology identifies your individual needs and caters accordingly. Your lack of comprehension on a topic is identified in real time and your lecture is shifted to tailor your learning curve.", "On the flip side, imagine being in a classroom or a lecture hall where your every move is being monitored. From the moment you step into the premises; sensors and cameras are following your every action and recording it for \u201cdata references\u201d. Your privacy is out of question and your real-time sensitive data is compromised at the expense of improved quality of teaching service.", "Eventually which side do you incline towards?", "Both of these scenarios are like the dual sides of a coin: integrated and inter-twirled. Artificial Intelligence aka AI technology has been the focus for improving and upgrading the present education system. Its primary focus is to improve the current learning experience for majority of its students. The scope and capabilities of the technology is infinite and the momentum is growing steadily. There has been studies conducted by various organizations to understand the impact of AI technology to evaluate their capabilities, risk and also to answer certain ethical questions. The current technology of AI in classroom premises is primarily data sensitive, pattern recognition and processing through software algorithm. These data can be easily incorporated into machine learning to built an even more powerful platform.", "Most of us fail to realize that we have already integrated subtle traces of AI technology in our present education system. For instance, grammar checking or plagiarism software that are preinstalled in blackboard (online submission platform)are perfect examples of artificial intelligence. These software can easily detect if an assignment is a direct quote from someone else\u2019s work without their appropriate reference or acknowledgement. Soon these kind of similar software can be upgraded to include features to detect paraphrased assignments between peer submission. They might even use machine learning (ML) to identify common practices between peers.", "Other AI based education model projects that have been used in many nations include: AI based teaching model that incorporates monitoring and analyzing performance of educators and students in real-time while in their classroom. However, adaptation of this model in the western world can create controversies and concerns over privacy issues. Moreover, most students might not be comfortable learning in a classroom environment and prefer to learn at their own pace. Pupil can also have different learning styles and might not adapt well to the current teaching methodology offered in that particular lecture as its happening in real time. Hence quantitative measure of classroom performance on monitoring and analyzing real time performance might not be a suitable approach.", "Certain K-12 classrooms are already incorporating AI based projects in their classroom. It allows scope for these participating students to develop critical thinking ability . It is this critical thinking ability that will eventually develop into a high tech programming skill. Both students and educators have rated such approaches as positive and allows scope for more cooperative interaction in the classroom environment.", "Educational institutes are considering this novel technology to monitor and gather student performance. It would eventually allow to quantify the learning trajectory of individual students. The quantitative study would allow scope to caution a failing student in a class ahead of time. One can easily argue that such approaches are already undertaken by in person sincere instructors. However, such task are usually time consuming for an instructor who is already preoccupied with their research and course teaching responsibilities. Secondly, it might also violate a student\u2019s esteem when approached by an instructor . Rather allowing AI technology to perform such task can allow early detection ( by analyzing patterns from artificial psychology ) and the derived conclusion can outperform by higher accuracy ( ignoring the effect of human biasing). The information can be delivered directly to the student through an app, so that they can pivot themselves or take necessary course of action.", "AI technology can also allow scope for individual students to identify the best choices for their elective courses, by analyzing data from their prior course credits and grades. These can easily be supplemented with industrial prospects to eventually maximize the student\u2019s potential. Artificial intelligence can definitely compliment the role of an advisor and is much beneficial as the student population in a classroom is growing.", "The biggest concern and challenge to incorporate AI in classroom are both pertaining to cybersecurity and privacy of information. Hence giving the option for individual student\u2019s discretion to opt for this technological application can stop violating their privacy concern. The future of AI is promising and the acceleration of technological progress will ensure that we are eventually all part of a SMART city.", "However, what is your opinion?
