To manage such large amounts of data, Twitter has a dedicated data science and analytics teams that employ advanced analytics and machine learning tools to improve their products and features toward delivering more relevant content on their feeds.", "The data scientist job position at Twitter is split into both data and research scientist roles. Twitter\u2019s data science roles are tailored-specific to the teams they are assigned to. Each Twitter\u2019s data science role is also different from one another. Data scientist job roles at Twitter depend heavily on the teams they\u2019re assigned to in specific features or services, and the role may span from analytics-based roles to model design and building heavy machine learning systems.", "Like most big tech companies, Twitter prefers to hire only skilled individuals with a minimum of 2+ years (5+ years for senior data scientist) with some experience in data infrastructure or backend systems. This means having an engineering background or understanding data systems is helpful unless the position is analytics specific.", "Twitter has a data science and analytics department with research scientists and data scientists working across a wide range of teams.

Questions in this interview can involve machine learning theory, product intuition with a focus on experimentation, and SQL or Python-based coding. Make sure to study how the Twitter product works and think about questions related to how to drive results out of experiment-based testing.", "The onsite interview process involves one-on-one interviews with 5 to 6 people (usually data scientists and data engineers from Twitter) lasting 45 minutes each. This interview will require whiteboard coding as well as algorithm questions that may range from machine learning to statistics/probability and product based questions.", "The on-site interview is a combination of a wide range of technical concepts.
