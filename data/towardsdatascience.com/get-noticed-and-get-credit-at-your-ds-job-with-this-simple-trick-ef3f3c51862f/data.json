But after a while you might be interested in freshening your task list: Have you just finished something big and looking for a small task to break routine? Suffer from \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d and not sure what to do next? Or maybe you just want to get noticed towards that raise you\u2019re planning to ask for? There are many ways to deal with these situations, but once in a while, if you\u2019re looking to add something new to your schedule \u2014 I suggest you take a work side project!", "Even if your company does have a data science team, it\u2019s a fair guess there\u2019s still plenty of places and plenty of data that haven\u2019t reached their full potential. I\u2019m talking about tasks from outside the data science team that might help other workers or the company: Are you familiar with some data nobody is touching yet and you could help distill some insights or predictions from? Maybe the sales department wants a model for seasonality? Or for which costumers might churn next? Maybe the fraud department could get help automating catching the bad guys? If you have a hard time thinking of examples, just ask your boss or colleagues if they could think of something. If this fails \u2014 go to the closest analysts team.", "Analysts are great people. They are naturally inquisitive, super thorough, and usually hold priceless domain knowledge which they perfected over months and years. They are probably great with SQL, databases and dashboards. The best are even wicked with some python scripting, using pandas or sklearn. But, even if they are top notch they usually fall short with stuff most data scientist can do: use machine learning, which is where you come in!", "If you still can\u2019t think of who and how you can help by now, go and directly talk to the analysts team: Ask about their tasks, what do they do that takes up much of their time, what features they look at when they\u2019re doing analysis. If they already use some kind of structured data, maybe wisely mashing it with other data might work? Ask nicely, and only a few people would refuse help. If you were able to find a clue for a possible task \u2014 now it\u2019s money time. Try to walk away with a dummy CSV you could play around with. It doesn\u2019t have to be long or complicated or even have all possible columns, just something for you to start with.", "Do not (DO NOT!) patronize, look down or think you could eliminate someone\u2019s job by mere automatization and a fancy jupyter notebook. Whatever code you might be writing will probably be used by the people you interviewed. They\u2019ll be the ones running it and the ones to figure out if what you\u2019re doing is any good. Their cooperation is crucial for the success of this project. Try to see what\u2019s their pain point. Describe possible outcomes of your joint project and see if this gets them excited.", "Make sure you don\u2019t choose data that needs much fussing and cleaning. Remember, you actually already have a full time job, and we\u2019re just reaching out to some low hanging fruit. Take the data, understand the type of problem you\u2019re trying to solve (regression? classification?), then just run a simple model. See if you manage to actually predict something. Look at feature importance and see if something useful pops out.", "I got tapped to help my company\u2019s fraud team to model fraud. Until now, The analysts were doing SQL queries on some databases. They had previous knowledge about 2\u20133 features that work well, and looked at the top scoring items in those features with SQL queries. These items were marked as suspicious and the analysts would go over them manually to check if their other qualities align to be suspicious as well. Even though this worked, it took a long time and it was obvious to me together we could do better: Why look at only 2\u20133 features when we have tens of others?", "I got a sample CSV that contained 1600 lines of historical fraud and non fraud exchanges, with 8 features. I used python\u2019s Catboost tree boosting package to model this classification problem. The model is now run by the analysts who periodically add more features they think of to improve the model. Estimates are that this made the process of eliminating fraud at least x5 faster.", "I highly recommend the Catboost gradient boosting package for these tasks. It is so powerful and simple to use, that it probably takes only 1\u20132 hours to set up the first working model, even if you haven\u2019t heard about this package before. It\u2019s very fast even if you run on your computer; handles tabular data very well and uses categorical features without the need for preprocessing (no 1-hot encoding! just marking which column is categorical). It works excellent even with no hyperparameter tuning. Of course, other things you like and familiar with are good too, as long as you keep in mind that someday, people who aren\u2019t you might want to run it, so keep it simple.", "That\u2019s basically it. Worst case scenario is this experiment wasted 3\u20134 hours with no effect. Best case scenario, you made a new friend, maybe learned something new and did something that\u2019s going to be useful (dare I say even very useful) for a long while. Try it!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data science team lead at Taboola.
