More than any other area, growth is all about optimizing future value. Here\u2019s some basic math that I regularly use to think about the impact of a strategy, idea, or project.", "Most growth objectives can be generalized into \u201cget more people to do more of something.\u201d The something, commonly called a metric, will depend on your strategy. Social media companies might optimize for the number of users who visit their site daily. SaaS companies might optimize for the number of companies with subscriptions. In our case, LinkedIn might want to get more readers to like and comment on this article. Here\u2019s a simple formula to illustrate this concept:", "growth objective = total actions = users \u00d7 engagement_rate", "We\u2019re intentionally leaving out a lot of details in the math to focus on the basics. From this formula, it\u2019s obvious that there are two levers to increase total actions. We can increase the number of users, or we can increase the engagement rate (number of actions per user). While these two concepts might seem obvious, the choice between these two have very different results when time is added to the equation.", "The first Growth challenge every social network faces is growing the number of users. Qualitatively this means we have good product-market fit, but not enough users to have the impact we want.", "When we focus on growing users, we also consistently increase actions over time. The chart below illustrates a simple example where we start with 10,000 users and add 500 new users each month. Assuming an engagement rate of 0.4 which does not change, then the number of actions each month also grows linearly.", "After building a healthy user growth engine, we\u2019ll want to revisit engagement rates. Realistically, as we grow our user base, we\u2019ll see a decline in engagement rates because we\u2019re reaching a broader and more diverse audience. What happens when we increase engagement rates?", "Take the example of increasing messages between LinkedIn users. One strategy might be to make the message icon larger to capture more user attention. Doing so could hypothetically increase engagement rates by +25%. Unlike the case with user growth, the increase in engagement rate is fixed and does not further increase over time. We will see a step-function increase in the total number of actions with the change in engagement rates. As a bonus, we\u2019ll also increase any future payoffs from user growth.", "Things become more interesting once we\u2019ve built a strong user growth engine and have good engagement rates. Let\u2019s take the example of increasing comments on articles in LinkedIn\u2019s feed. For simplicity, we\u2019ll continue with the numbers from the previous 2 examples. If we had to choose between growing feed users (+500 users per month, or equivalently +100% user growth rate) or growing the rate of comments (+0.125 actions per user, or equivalently +25% engagement rate), which strategy would have a larger impact on the number of comments?", "Unfortunately, the answer is that it depends. As mentioned earlier, growing engagement produces a single large boost to actions. In contrast, growing users produces a slow steady increase to actions. When we compare actions per month, we are comparing the run rate.", "To compare the cumulative number of comments generated by the two strategies, we need to add up the impact from each month. This is roughly equivalent to calculating the area under the curve, or taking an integral (for those of you who miss calculus). We will find that choosing to grow engagement will produce more cumulative actions in the next 2 years. However, after the 2 year point, growing users will win handsomely.", "As we see from this simple example, the correct decision between optimizing user growth or engagement depends on when you want to see the payoff. The survival of our product strategy may depend on the results we can generate in the next few months. On the other hand, we should also be wary of over-emphasizing immediate payoffs or risk falling behind more future oriented competitors. The optimal growth strategy will typically include a mix of each strategy. The right mixture will depend on where we are now, where we want to be in the near future, and of course, the far future.", "Some of you might strongly associate growth with exponential growth and are wondering where and how that happens. All the concepts mentioned so far lead to fixed gains, or linear growth at best. The short answer to exponential growth is virality. In a future article, we\u2019ll show how we can take the simple growth equation above and modify it to account for virality. We\u2019ll also see how strong virality leads to exponential growth!", "Your home for data science.
