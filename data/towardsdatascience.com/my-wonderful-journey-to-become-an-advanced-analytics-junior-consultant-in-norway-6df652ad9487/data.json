This is why, I\u2019ve decided to share my honest experience, so you can get a better idea of what to expect and hopefully help you decide if this is the right choice for you.", "Additionally, I\u2019ve decided to share my experience as a whole and not only talk about the master and its professional opportunities, so I will cover additional topics like some of the extracurricular activities that I\u2019ve been involved, my experience living in Norway, my internship as a data analyst in an energy consulting and business intelligence data firm, among other things.", "Here is the general structure of my testimony \ud83d\ude42.", "A little bit about my background", "Before starting my master\u2019s degree, I finished my bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration at ITAM in Mexico City. Additionally, I worked for one year as a quantitative equity trader in Mexico, and in my final year of bachelor\u2019s, I had the opportunity to study abroad in HEC Paris and in WU Vienna University of Economics and Business. This experience exposed me to an incredible learning environment and since that moment, I knew that I wanted to study my master\u2019s abroad, especially in Europe.", "With a background in business administration, I knew that I wanted to choose a more technical master (not an MBA) but always keeping in mind the business and applied aspect. This is why an MSc in Business Analytics was very appealing to me. With the vast amounts of data generated every day and with the new advancements in computer and software capabilities, I knew that there was a huge potential to optimize and improve decision making for companies based on data-driven analysis. The job market and the possibility of implementing analytics in any type of industry and department was also very attractive.", "The master\u00b4s program in BI Norwegian Business School combines a set of knowledge and skills that blends data science with business subjects. It places a strong emphasis on the application of knowledge and it offers you the flexibility to personalize your degree with internships, exchange programs, and certifications.", "It\u2019s also ranked by the Financial Times as Norway\u00b4s best business school for the fifth straight year in a row in its yearly European Business School ranking 2019.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I wanted to study my MSc somewhere in Europe. I searched for different programs in England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries but Norway caught my eye. After reading about its high standard of living, gender equality, stable economy, attractive job market, low levels of corruption, and great outdoor activities, I was convinced.", "Of course, everything is not perfect as it sounds and there\u2019s always a downside like in any part of the world. You will also experience cold and dark winters, maybe not the best nightlife (especially coming from Mexico), high prices, and sometimes difficulties to really get to know Norwegian people. I will talk about this in more detail in a later section, where I talked about Oslo, its people, and culture.", "Structure of the program, courses covered and level of difficulty", "The master is a two-year full-time program divided into two semesters, one in the autumn and one in spring. In the first year, you have most of your courses where you learn the fundamentals. It\u2019s a combination of lectures, group projects, final exams, elective courses, and workshops. The second-year is more applied, where you can choose to do an internship, become a consultant for an external company, or pursue your academic interests by becoming a research assistant. Additionally, you have to complete two more courses and write your master thesis in the last year. The program offers the flexibility to complete the second year of the MSc in any part of the world and the size of the classes are around 40 people so you get to experience more personalized attention.", "In the first semester of the MSc I had 5 courses: Data Management and Python Programming, Business Optimization, Applied Data Analytics, Data Protection and Ethics in the Modern Business Environment, and Decision Theory and System Dynamics.", "Applied Data Analytics focused on statistics and mathematics using R. The level of difficulty from my experience was intermediate but it gave me a good refresh of different topics like logistic regression, hypothesis testing, and exploratory factor analysis. In Data Management and Python Programming, we learned how to code in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and in the second part of the course, we learned about relational databases and how to retrieve data from such databases using SQL.", "Business optimization was a very interesting and challenging course. We learned how to use mathematical modeling to support practical business management decisions. During the course, we used AMPL algebraic modeling system and learned some of the most common modeling techniques for deterministic optimization, such as linear programming (LP), integer programming (IP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and nonlinear programming (NLP) with applications in logistics/operations and strategy.", "Ethics was a normal essay focusing on GDPR and the course of Decision Theory and System Dynamics I found it a little bit boring and the group project was very time-consuming. The course consisted of modeling the waste sorting system in Oslo using Vensim (a simulation software) to analyze how different actions and strategies impact the percentage of the recycled material in the city.", "In the second semester, I had 5 courses as well: Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning, Business Simulation, Visualization and Network Theory and my two electives: Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Technologies and Applications, and Supply Chain Analytics.", "My favorite course was Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning with John Chandler Johnson, it was amazing! He did his MSc and PhD in Statistics at Stanford University and he was great at communicating and teaching this course. I liked his approach of focusing on the business applications to deliver value to companies but also keeping in mind the most important concepts and technical requirements needed during the process of building a machine learning model.", "We learned how to build supervised machine learning models using Python and DataRobot and worked in a group project to detect credit card fraud\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0bank. I thought the level of difficulty for this course was going to be very high but it turned out to be intermediate.", "The elective that I took in Artificial Intelligence was related to the course in machine learning and the level of difficulty was higher and more technical. We started with an introduction to AI, learned how AI is put into practice in businesses, and how to assess its potential benefits. Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python was covered in the course as well as some of the most common search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and more about machine learning.", "The other elective course that I chose, Supply Chain Analytics, was the continuation of Business Optimization. We solved more advanced problems for supply chain optimization, demand forecasting, operations scheduling, and safety stock analysis.", "For the Business Simulation course, we built a simulation model to test different policies for boarding on a plane in AnyLogic, and for the course in Visualization and Network Theory, we worked on social network analysis using Gephi. From my perspective, I think the visualization course left much to be desired and can be improved. Hopefully, in the future, they don\u2019t focus too much on social network analysis and start using more Tableau and Power BI to learn how to build dashboards and compelling visualization to tell a story using the right graphs.", "Additionally, the university offers you free access to the DataCamp website which is a great place to learn more about data science and complement your studies. You can also take free e-learning courses to get certified in SAS Software and access the Financial Times newsletter.", "If you want to do an exchange, you can do it in the second or third semester but the options (universities) are limited. For the second semester, you can study in Warwick, Bocconi, or Portugal, and in the third semester, you can go to the Netherlands, in Tilburg.", "What I really liked about my university and considered an edge compared to other universities in Norway is its strong connection to the industry. Since the beginning of your studies, you have a lot of exposure to different companies in career fairs, workshops, and company events. As a member of the Master Merit Society, I had the opportunity to participate in workshops with Gjensidige, Equinor, Deloitte, among other companies, and get to know them more personally. Additionally, you can access the BI Career Portal to search for jobs in companies that are interested in a university student profile.", "Finally, I encourage you to be proactive and search for events happening near your area. In my first semester, I went to the Data Science Day at the University of Oslo (UiO), and it was a great experience! You get the chance to meet people that are interested in data science, listen to conferences of data scientists (in my case it was a data scientist of Facebook working in the US), and network with companies present in the event such as BCG Gamma and DNV GL just to name a few.", "My experience as a data analyst intern at Rystad Energy", "As I mentioned before, in the third semester of the masters you have three options to choose: do an internship, a consulting project with a selected company, or collaborate with a teacher as a research assistant. I had the opportunity to do an internship as a data analyst for 10 weeks at Rystad Energy. They are one of the leading energy consulting and business intelligence data firms offering global databases, strategy advisory, and research products for oil service companies, investors, and governments.", "During this internship, I was involved in two main projects.", "In the first project, I conduct a geospatial analysis in Python using geographic coordinates and specific identifiers of oil wells in Argentina to improve data modeling accuracy and create visualizations using Tableau.", "In the second project, I gathered, cleaned, and synthesized data coming from multiple sources to benchmark the biggest oil companies in the upstream sector based on their CO2 emissions generated per barrel.", "The experience was very rewarding and important for me to acknowledge the challenges of not finding the data as complete and clean as you would like to. I learned how to collaborate in an international office environment, how important it is to keep constant communication with your team and how your work can have an impact on the decisions that other companies take based on your analysis.", "My experience as an advanced analytics junior consultant at SAS Software", "A few weeks ago, I started this new journey in my professional career that I\u2019m very happy to be a part of. I joined SAS Institute in Norway to work in a consulting project with one of their clients in the telecommunications industry to help them leverage the value of their data by implementing advanced analytics to improve their marketing decisions.", "My team and I are currently working on optimizing customer journeys with the help of machine learning algorithms. The idea is to personalize digital customer experiences on their website based on different segmentations, channels, and trigger events using SAS Customer Intelligence 360.", "So far, we are experimenting with A/B testing and attribution analysis. In the beginning, it\u2019s been a little bit challenging to keep the pace and learn how to use the Solution proficiently while having many meetings with different stakeholders and deliver progress to my supervisor; but I\u2019m confident that with dedication and teamwork this project will create value to the client.", "In the near future, I will write a blog about the challenges, results, and skills developed during this project \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc.", "Another crucial aspect for me during my studies is to get involved in different extracurricular activities and exercise constantly to stay healthy, strong, and focused.", "The student union at the university offers a wide variety of societies and organizations that you can be a part of. Usually, at the beginning of each semester, they organized the Recruitment Day where all the student organizations are present to share their activities and events.", "In the first semester of the master\u2019s, I decided to join the BI Sailing Team and BISO Invest \u2014 Capital Management as a risk analyst. I loved both experiences and it helped me to meet more people from other master programs and experience incredible opportunities like navigating in the Norwegian fjords \ud83d\ude0e.", "Oslo is a very relaxed and enjoyable city to live where you can experience a lot of nature with beautiful people and high prices \ud83d\ude05. In general, Norwegians have a high quality of life, compared to other countries and take things with calmness and without stress.", "Before moving to Oslo, I was living in Mexico City so for me Oslo was little at the beginning. I remembered that in the first week I saw most of the city, but there\u2019s a lot of hikes and beautiful places that you will discover over time.", "Norwegians are very nice and are always willing to help you. Most of the population speaks English perfectly, and they love to be outside in the woods, hiking and relaxing in their cabins with friends and family. I think they are shy at the beginning, but then when you get to know them a little bit more, they will open and be very friendly (especially if you give them some alcohol \ud83d\ude02). I have many Norwegian friends, but I think it\u2019s more difficult to be very close to them especially if you don\u2019t speak Norwegian.", "The public transport is efficient, the city is very safe and the forest or the beach are just 10 minutes away. Depending on the season you can practice different activities, like going cross-country skiing in the winter or hike and camp in summer.", "Down here, you will see a list of my approximate monthly living expenses. This is an \u201capproximate\u201d because there were some months where I traveled, went out a little bit more, or bought additional things that are not included in this budget. I know some people that live with 8,000 NOK a month (a very limited budget) and other friends that spend much more than that, but I think on average students tend to spend between 9 to 12,000 NOK each month.", "I\u2019m very grateful to have received the BI Presidential Scholarship that covers 100% of the tuition fees and additionally I received a grant each semester to pay for my living expenses.", "Normally, I tend to spend more money than the amount that I receive from the university, but with the salary from the internship and a little bit of extra help from my parents at the beginning, then I was able to pay for my living expenses for the whole master.", "I think the economic factor is an important aspect to consider because Norway is a very expensive country to live, so if you don\u2019t have a scholarship or the ability to pay for the tuition and living expenses without compromising your wallet, I think it\u2019s too risky. Of course, studying a master\u2019s abroad is a wonderful experience, and you learn a lot from it but nowadays there\u2019s a lot of resources online that might be a better option for you (but that\u2019s another topic to discuss).", "Norway has been a great place to live but at the same time, I really miss my family and friends from Mexico, its perfect weather, delicious food, excellent parties, and warm people that maybe in Norway is more difficult to find. My philosophy is that you need to enjoy and appreciate the good things that you have in the present and take advantage of the opportunities and experiences that you are living at that moment.", "Studying a masters in business analytics has been an incredible experience, not only from the academic and professional aspect but also to meet people from all around the world, experience a new culture, traditions and to explore the Norwegian nature.", "If you have the possibility to study your masters abroad, I really encourage you to do it! It will help you to grow in all aspects of your life and you will have a lot of fun during the journey (with long hours in the library \ud83e\udd13).", "Thanks to this opportunity, I was able to start a career in data science and worked in different companies in an international environment with very smart and experienced people that help me to learn and grow professionally.", "Please, feel free to connect and write to me on Linkedin if you have any questions associated with the master\u2019s, my experience in Norway, or topics related to data science. I hope my testimony was useful to gain a better understanding of the masters and motivate you to consider a career in data science.", "Finally, I would like to thank you for reading my testimony and I wish you the best of luck in your professional and personal career! \ud83d\ude03", "Your home for data science.
