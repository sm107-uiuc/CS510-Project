You can explore some of our most popular topics on our tags page.", "Authors approach these (and other) topics from many different angles. Some help beginners with getting started, create hands-on tutorials, or share their latest tips and tricks; others dive deep into complex problems or write about cutting-edge research.", "If you\u2019re not sure what to write about, choose something close to home.

Yet, we find that many authors lack some basic skills, which prevent them from correctly getting their message across. Here is our selection of writing resources:", "Before writing your article, you need to be very clear about what you are trying to achieve. Once you have formed the idea for your post, you should try to answer these questions:", "It depends! We generally don\u2019t publish event or book announcements, and avoid articles that serve primarily as a vehicle to publicize your latest podcast episode, YouTube video, or other media on another platform. For example, a post consisting of nothing more than a short introduction and a video embed or link to another site isn\u2019t going to be a good fit for TDS.", "If your article features one of these elements, we would still consider it for publication if it meets a few conditions:", "We\u2019re glad you asked! We highly recommend submitting your new articles to TDS in draft form, rather than as published posts. Why? The TDS homepage and Medium\u2019s Following feed are both organized in reverse-chronological order by date of first publication. That means the most recently published posts are shown near the top, so any article we receive as a draft will have greater reach and visibility at the moment we add it to our publication.", "By contrast, a post you already published on your own \u2014 even just a couple of days before its appearance on TDS \u2014 will be easily lost amid all the newer posts we publish every day. In short: sharing a draft can increase your article\u2019s potential readership.", "Submitting a draft also helps our team share feedback and suggestions for improvement before publishing your article, which means no post-publication edits or corrections. It allows us to work with you on making the best-possible first impression on your audience.", "If you\u2019ve already published your post but still wish to share it with TDS, that\u2019s fine \u2014 we\u2019re always thrilled to consider your work.

We will review it as soon as we can.", "If we believe that your article is excellent and ready to go, this is how you will be able to add your post to our publication. If \u201cTowards Data Science\u201d shows up after you click on \u201cAdd to publication\u201d in the dropdown menu at the top of the page, that means we have added you as an author and are waiting for you to submit your article. Once you have submitted your article, it will be reviewed by an editor before a final decision is made.", "If we think that your article is interesting but needs to be improved, someone from our team will provide you with feedback directly on your submitted Medium article.", "Please note that we only respond to articles that were properly submitted using either our form or via an email that exactly follows the instructions listed here. We don\u2019t respond to pitches or questions already answered in our FAQs or on our Contribute page. We also ignore articles that don\u2019t comply with our rules.", "If you haven\u2019t heard from us within the next five working days, please carefully check the article you submitted to our team. See if you can now submit it directly to TDS and look for any private notes from us that you may have missed. You should also make sure to check your spam folder.", "If you just can\u2019t reach us, the best thing for you to do is submit your article to another publication. Although we\u2019d love to, we can\u2019t provide customized feedback to everyone because we simply receive too many submissions. You can learn more about our decision here and submit another post in a month.", "If your post is recent, it will appear on our homepage below \u201cLatest\u201d. Depending on your tags, your post will also appear on our different pages.", "Before submitting your post make sure you read Medium\u2019s Curation Guidelines. Even our best authors tend to make basic mistakes that disqualify their article from being distributed in Medium\u2019s topics (Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence \u2026), and from being featured on Towards Data Science.", "If you want our team to mention you on Twitter, please ensure that your medium profile contains your Twitter account. It can take a few days to get your post featured on our social media.", "Finally, your post will be searchable in our publication, appears in our archive, and can be recommended to our readers at the bottom of other articles written by your peers.", "Yes, as long as your article is relevant to our readers, we are interested in adding it to TDS. Please do not duplicate your article on Medium! They do not allow posting duplicate content on their platform.", "Cross-posting content you have published elsewhere (not on Medium) is allowed provided it follows the Medium guidelines and that your post wasn\u2019t already published on Medium.", "While we\u2019d like to be able to leave feedback on all of the incredible submissions we receive, we are a small team, and we aren\u2019t able to leave suggestions on all of the articles we review. However, there are some common reasons why we reject a new post.", "We\u2019re a Medium publication and we use the curation guidelines for every article we publish. This means that we look for articles with high-quality writing and content, articles that offer solid value to readers, and articles that are free of typos and grammatical errors. It also means that we decline articles that include disqualifying elements like clickbait, sponsored content, marketing/ads, press releases, or plagiarism. We recommend that you take a look at the guidelines! You might be surprised to find out that articles that contain friend links or clap requests are not allowed.", "We also have our own guidelines that you can find here. Our guidelines include topics like how your code should be displayed and how your images must be sourced and cited. Along with our guidelines, you\u2019ll find advice and tips for getting published and ensuring that you are getting your message across to our audience.", "If you read through the guidelines above carefully, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll find the reason your article was rejected. However, here are some of the most common reasons we decline submissions:", "If you\u2019re not sure how to embed your code, this is a great resource. For help with Grammar, you might want to try a free tool like grammarly.com. Hemingway can be another great resource for writing assistance. If you aren\u2019t sure how to format mathematical equations on Medium, you might enjoy this article or the embed.fun tool. If you want examples of what editors at Towards Data Science are looking for, take a look at our editor\u2019s picks!", "We love publishing posts from data science professionals with industry experience. If your post revolves around a product or project you\u2019ve worked on, you\u2019re welcome to submit it to TDS as long as its primary purpose is to educate and inform, not to sell or promote.", "Please note that we\u2019re less likely to publish product-centered posts from authors who have recently written on similar topics, or whose posts focus primarily on their product/company.", "If we\u2019ve asked you to reflect on the ethical or safety stakes of your project, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve written about topics such as facial recognition, tracking, or detecting identifying personal markers (age, ethnicity, and gender, among others), or you\u2019re using a dataset that might raise ethical concerns.", "As the ethical and risk issues are inherent to the topic and the dataset, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. So, we\u2019ve prepared some questions you might answer to create a discussion appropriate for your article. We\u2019ve also included some published articles where the author has done a good job of discussing risks or ethical concerns.", "Check your biases by Veronica Villa (ethical/bias risk)", "Train a Model to Detect Breast MRI tumors with Deep Learning and PyTorch by Nick Konz (medical risk)", "It would be great if all dataset licenses were easy to find, had the same language, and were easy to read. Sadly, this isn\u2019t the case. Often it takes patience and perseverance to determine whether you have the right to use a dataset.", "Careful! There are two similar codes that do not allow for commercial use, which means these datasets can\u2019t be used in TDS articles:", "5. Licensing that applies to program source code, for example, MIT and Apache, doesn\u2019t also automatically cover, or imply a right to use a related dataset.", "6. A license that limits use to \u201cresearch and educational purposes\u201d presents a problem. Although you may have done research in your article, or are presenting material for educational purposes, you are publishing in a commercial publication. Generally research and education applies only to work published in academic journals, college/university courses, and conference proceedings.", "7. Books, screenplays, magazines, and newspaper articles are covered by copyright. So, those Harry Potter scripts you\u2019d like to use? They\u2019re off-limits unless you obtain permission. However, older publications may be in the public domain and free to use for your article. Copyright generally lasts the life of the author plus 50 years (Canada) to 70 years (European Union, United States). There are more rules around copyright, and it\u2019s best to consult with the Copyright Act of the country where the work was first published to determine if copyright has expired and you are free to use the document. When in doubt, ask for permission!", "There\u2019s no easy answer to this one because anyone may upload data to a repository, and each dataset has its own license. It\u2019s important that you read the supplied information carefully to determine where the data came from and the license that applies to it, before using it in your article.", "Many times datasets are created from scraped data and then given a public domain license (by the party who scraped it) in the mistaken belief that the repository owner permitted making the data/program available. Remember that only the original data owner can grant permission.", "If you are participating in a data science competition or hackathon and plan to share your progress or solution on TDS, please make sure that their rules allow you to share the data. Some datasets are intended to be used only for the competition or hackathon, and cannot be shared in an article published with TDS.", "If you plan to use an API to create your own dataset, please be absolutely certain that you have the right to use the API (and any data acquired via the API) before submitting your article to TDS. Check the API or the website\u2019s terms of use to see if they allow commercial use, and read any restrictions carefully.", "First, it is important to note that the lack of a notice or license doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s free to use. Sometimes, the data is covered under an umbrella organization, for example, a city\u2019s utility department might be covered under the city\u2019s general data sharing policy.", "Other times, the owner has simply neglected to post a notice. In these cases, we suggest that you consider contacting the owner to ask for permission, rather than assume the data is fine to use.", "An email sent to a dataset owner asking for permission doesn\u2019t have to be lengthy. It should include information about your intended article, yourself, and Towards Data Science. Here\u2019s a sample you might find helpful:", "I am writing an article about [topic] to be published in Towards Data Science, a publication available on Medium. I found your dataset here [link] and thought it was well aligned with my work. I am contacting you to ask for permission to use this dataset for my article. You can learn more about me here [link to profile, LinkedIn, website, etc.], and about Towards Data Science here.", "No, we don\u2019t allow sponsored posts.", "We don\u2019t allow any advertising or sponsored posts.", "Yes. But, we prefer to publish posts that are submitted from a Medium profile that belongs to a real person. Also, we don\u2019t allow advertising and don\u2019t propose writing services.", "You will need to contact the author of the post directly. Articles belong to authors so we can\u2019t approve their translation for them.", "Yes, you can mention that you are an independent contributing author to the TDS publication.
