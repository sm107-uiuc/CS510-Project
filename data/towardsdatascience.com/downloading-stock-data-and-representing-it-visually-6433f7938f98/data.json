Plotly a Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.", "Let\u2019s Get Started. Initially, we will start by installing the YFinace library which we will use to download the stock data and see some of its features.", "Run the command given below in the command prompt to install yfinance using pip.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the library and downloading the stock data. Here the stock ticker I am using is HINDPETRO.NS which is Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, you can choose any stock to analyze, just replace the stock ticker with your stock\u2019s ticker.", "Now let us explore some functions that YFinance Library provides. This is just a small example there is much more, that you can explore here.", "Similarly, you can use the following given below commands to display the look at the stock dividends and stock split separately.", "Now let us download the data into a data frame and display it.", "For performing further operations we need to reset the index of the data frame and covert the respective columns to float datatype. Below given commands will solve our purpose.", "After this, let us start with the visualization part. For this first, we will need to install Plotly.", "A line chart is highly used for time series analysis, for viewing the stock trend over a time period. Here I will explain to you how you can create an interactive line chart using Plotly. The commands below will create a line chart of the stock data stored in the data frame over the maximum time period.", "The code also includes the lines for creating buttons that can be selected to display a line chart for particular time periods.", "An OHLC chart is a type of bar chart that shows open, high, low, and closing prices for each period. OHLC charts are useful since they show the four major data points over a period, with the closing price being considered the most important by many traders.", "The code given below will create an OHLC chart with range selector.", "Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movements based on past patterns. Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.", "An area chart or area graph displays graphically quantitative data. It is based on the line chart. The area between axis and line is commonly emphasized with colors, textures, and hatchings.", "The code given below will create an area chart of the stock data.", "All these charts are created using Plotly so that you can interact with the charts. All the charts mentioned above are the main charts that are used for financial analysis.", "In this article, we started with downloading the stock data and performing different operations/functions using YFinance. After that, we plotted different financial charts using Plotly which are used for financial/Stock Data Analysis.", "Thanks for reading!
