I had planned to continue with Andrew Ng and start on the Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai. Which although looks amazing, I stumbled upon this specialization offered by IBM.", "So, what drew me towards IBM\u2019s specialization? There are a two main reasons:", "This article, as the Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science, will naturally be about my experience with the first part of the specialization (weeks one \u2014 four). We will also cover:", "The course starts with a brief introduction to Apache Spark with the course\u2019s instructor Romeo (a chief data scientist at IBM) and what we will be covering over the next couple of weeks. Following this are instructions on how to setup Apache Spark with IBM Watson Studio, the cloud service used throughout the course.", "There are then two short programming \u2018assignments\u2019, simply to ensure that you have the environment setup correctly. This week can easily be done in less than an hour, I wouldn\u2019t call it a week per se...", "Here we begin to work on our understanding of different data storage solutions. Namely:", "After covering the pros and cons of each, we move into learning about Apache Spark, focusing on scalability and parallel processing. This part is actually very interesting! We take a look at all of the different components of Apache Spark, both hardware and software.", "We learn that ApacheSpark is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). To speed up our computations we can use multiple worker nodes in parallel, where we have two options on how to split our workload: (1) split our data and computations between worker nodes (JBOD approach) or (2) split our computations between worker nodes and pull data from an off node source using a \u2018switching fabric\u2019.", "Option (1) requires a software component to treat physically separate storage disks as just one with the Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD) approach (officially called spanning). This software is the \u2018Hadoop Distributed File System\u2019 (HDFS) which creates a virtual view on top of the worker nodes individual storage components, this view can then be treated as a single virtual file spanning the cluster.", "Option (2) is simpler but comes with a minor degree of latency due to the transfer speed between the off-node data storage and worker nodes. This is the setup we use throughout the course.", "From here we learn more about Spark\u2019s architecture and APIs. Spark stores data in a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). We can create a random dataset, perform a simple calculation and collect the first 5 results like so:", "Alternatively, Spark provides a SQL support via ApacheSparkSQL. This wraps the RDD in a DataFrame, allowing relational queries. This is then interacted with using ApacheSparkSQL. An example of using this setup to query the standard deviation for the product size of a product population in dataframe products:", "We can still interact directly with the RDD even when using SQL queries, for example if we would like to pull all data from a column:", "This week is quite simple but useful nonetheless. We look at the four statistical moments and also covariance, covariance matrices and correlation. Finally we introduce multidimension vector spaces.", "During the first portion of the week we look at the four statistical moments:", "If you have any statistical background, these concepts you probably know. Embarrassingly I did not know that kurtosis was actually called \u2018kurtosis\u2019, but nonetheless they\u2019re all super easy concepts to understand and apply.", "Following this we lead into covariance and correlation, which I think are more interesting. We use these properties to help us understand the relationship between different columns.", "Correlation is simply a measure of dependency, if there is a strong positive relationship between two dimensions we will find a correlation value near +1, if there is a strong negative relationship, we find -1. For two completely independent dimensions we will find a correlation value of zero.", "To calculate the correlation we need to calculate the covariance for dimensions X, Y (see below) over the standard deviation for both dimensions.", "Something that I believe is very useful as it is something I have run into a few times before is the Correlation or Covariance Matrices. They both function in the same way, but one measures the correlation and the other covariance.", "In the correlation matrix above, we can see that dimension four has no correlation with any other dimensions. We can take this to mean that dimension four either contains a lot of useful information, or that it is completely irrelevant. To build a correlation matrix in Spark we can use the MLLib library.", "Once we finish the basic statistics in Spark videos we have one final section on multidimensional vector spaces, this is pretty small and straight-forward. This is followed by the second and final quiz for this week and the programming assignment. The programming assignment is easy but fun, implementing the statistical methods learned above into Spark.", "The final week starts off with a quick look at plotting with matplotlib. Matplotlib isn\u2019t built into to Spark, so we are pulling data from our RDD and then feeding it into matplotlib as usual. If you use Python already, this part will be super easy.", "Next is Dimensionality Reduction. Here we look at using the Principle Components Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the number of dimensions in our dataset (I\u2019m about to take a quick detour to explain PCA in ultra simple terms).", "We learn that PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset whilst retaining relationships between dimensions. Taking the plot above, we have a 3-dimensional vector space (R^n) that we want to fit into a 2-dimensional vector space (R^k). We want to find a surface onto which the 3D data can be mapped whilst minimizing the distance moved.", "Once we find a plane that minimizes the change in distance, we project the 3D points onto the new 2D plane, resulting in our dimensionality reduction. This is essentially finding the direction in which there is little variation and removing it. In reality we would often be dealing with high-dimensional vector spaces, but the reduction concept is the same.", "In the course Romeo (the instructor) points out that one of the key properties maintained by PCA is the ratios of distances between points, the notation of which is above. I think this is an interesting point and alongside the explanation above I think certainly helps improve my understanding of what PCA is actually doing.", "Following the PCA videos we have a quick quiz and a final programming assignment. Both are quite simple, I found this programming assignment the easiest as most of the difficulty in the previous assignments stemmed from a lack of experience with Spark, but by this point I felt much more comfortable.", "Okay so that is all for the first part of IBMs Advanced Data Science Specialization! Honestly I think the course is very easy but at the same time introduces Apache Spark very well.", "My only minor complaint at this point is that the programming assignments are possibly too abstracted, I would have liked to be setting up the RDDs and ApacheSparkSQL objects myself, but I think this is done to keep the introductory part of the specialization simple.", "The instructor Romeo is very good and I believe he is extremely talented, he seems to have a very strong ease of explaining everything. The content is direct and there is a strong background in theory to deepen the understanding of the tools being used.", "I completed the course in two weeks, whilst also incredibly busy at work. So it is quite brief, but I think it introduces Apache Spark well nonetheless.", "Overall, I am super happy with what I have learned and I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in the basics of cloud computing for data science. Let me know your thoughts!", "If you are interested in learning about Stanford University\u2019s Machine Learning MOOC, see here:", "Your home for data science.
