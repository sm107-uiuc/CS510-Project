This is really a hot topic for established companies and startups alike, since everybody wants to have a well functioning data science team, and the reporting line of data seems to be one of the unknowns in the equation. I believe that these discussions completely miss the point, and I\u2019ll try to explain why.", "First of all, the most important thing is to know what your company wants to achieve. Is your company expanding to newer cities? Opening new verticals? Are you focus on monetising your current user base?", "Once you know this, you need to understand the value are you going to add to your company from Data Science.", "The structure will be very dependent on the value you want to provide.", "There are multiple ways to structure a data science team. Data scientists can be on", "There\u2019s a whole continuum in between. You may have data scientists embedded on specific product units, and a a core analytics team working for the whole company. The bliss point will definitely depend on your company strategy, product structure and maturity.", "Reporting lines are somewhat independent from team structures mentioned above. You may have a central data science department reporting to the CTO, or distributed data scientists reporting to product managers, or data analysts reporting to the CFO, you may have a central data science team reporting to a CDO, or distributed data scienctists reporting to the CDO, or any configuration in between.", "Regardless of whether data reports to the CTO, CPO, or whoever, if your objective is to build a company where data science is a strategic value, data scientists should be close to the leadership team. If, for instance, data science is a supporting role, they can be reporting to a functional head.", "This is not exclusive of data. Strategically important sectors sit close to the top. Since cloud is important for Amazon, they have Andrew Jassy as part of the senior management, and that\u2019s since powertrain and batteries are crucial for Tesla, Andrew Baglino is part of their leadership team.", "Count the steps from your data scientists to the CEO. That\u2019s your proxy for the importance of data science at your company.", "Structures should help teams work more efficiently, reducing frictions, silos and facilitating communication. Here are a non-exhaustive list of examples that can help you out:", "Asking some data science managers and based upon personal experience, there are some recurring frictions with departments. Engineering comes top on the list. There are multiple reasons:", "Just to name a few. To avoid this, involve the other part on technical decisions that are relevant to them. Ask engineers how\u2019s best to deploy new models. Involve data scientists on engineering discussions of data structures, give client developers ownership and means implement high quality event tracking. You can have the best department structure and a world-class data science team, and be set for failure given those frictions. These bridges could be as simple as recurrent meetings that align data with external teams.", "Your company and product are going to iterate constantly, so you\u2019ll have to evolve accordingly. For that reason, take this structure as something dynamic, test different setups, ask your team how they\u2019re performing and tweak it accordingly.", "Your home for data science.
