These indicators analyze trends in historical data in order to forecast future price movements. But are they really effective?", "Before getting into the code and the results, let\u2019s dive into what types of indicators are there and what they aim to do. The primary indicators include Moving Averages, Oscillators, and Pivots.", "Moving Averages: The moving average (MA) is a simple technical indicator that smooths out historical pricing data by creating a regularly updated average price. The average is taken over a particular period of time, whether it be 30 minutes, 30 days, or any other time period the trader prefers. These often block out the noise in price movements and provide the trader with a general trend of how the security is moving.", "Oscillators: Oscillators are indicators often used to identify momentum trends, whose fluctuations are bounded by some upper and lower band. By identifying how securities have performed in the past under the same momentum, traders can make decisions depending on whether they believe the stock is over or undervalued.", "Pivots: The Pivot Indicators include information on support and resistance levels which assist traders to visualize where the security may bounce back or breakthrough. These indicators also help identify and confirm trades when used in conjunction with other analysis tools.", "Some of the most popular indicators include Moving Averages Crossovers (20, 50, and 200 days), Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Commodity Channel Index (CCI).", "So in order to answer this question, I set out to create a Python program that backtests these 5 most popular indicators for any security and time period. In order to save time and optimize the amount of information I can put in this article, I will only explain the structure behind the program and rather focus on the outputs. With that being said, please reach out to me if you have any questions at all!", "The link to the full code for this article can be found in this GitHub Gist.", "First off, we must import the packages we will use for the rest of the program. The primary packages include NumPy, Pandas, TaLib, and Yfinance. NumPy and Pandas assist in the data analysis while TaLib and Yfinance allow us to easily calculate the technical indicators and receive the historical pricing data. You can easily download any of these modules using PyPi, Pythons Package Manager!", "We can set up the stock and number of years with input statements so you don't have to change the code each time you run it in order to check other symbols/time periods. Lastly, we can set the signals list to the 5 indicators and set the other statistics we will acquire into empty lists.", "In this section of the code, we actually get into the backtesting! We can loop through the original list of signals we created in the beginning and set up each of the strategies.", "In this particular example, the short SMA is an average of 20 days while the long SMA is 50 days. We can create the variables position, counter, and percentChange in order to implement and track the strategy. Next, we can create our signals for buying (20 SMA > 50 SMA) and selling (50 SMA > 20 SMA) the security.", "Lastly, we can collect the statistics on how the strategy performed. The statistics include the number of trades, percent change, last buy price, last sell price, average gain and loss per trade, max gain and loss per trade, gain/loss ratio, and the success rate for the signals.", "Once all the signals are completed (just repeat this process with the buy and sell signals of the other indicators), we can create a Pandas DataFrame with the list of statistics we have acquired with the code below.", "In order to truly find out if a strategy is effective, we must also compare it to how the security performed on itself during the same period (Buy & Hold ). For example, if Bollinger Bands generated a 200% return but the security itself gained 250%, then it is evident we must either change the strategy or abandon it altogether.", "By now, we have a full DataFrame containing all the statistics on how the strategies performed over the set period of time and so its finally time to answer the question: Are Technical Indicators Effective?", "I know, I promised to give a concrete answer to how effective Technical Indicators are but the answer truly depends on a multitude of factors. Technical analysis is about probability and likelihoods, not guarantees. If an indicator works more often than not, even though it does not work all the time, it can still be effective at generating profits.", "In the majority of cases (about 78%) when I ran the code with hundreds of different tickers, the Buy & Hold was not the leading strategy in returns. However, the strategies that lead in returns varied greatly and so there was not one single indicator that performed exceptionally better than the others every time.", "Based on my results, there is still potential in using Technical Indicators in a trading strategy but it must consist of multiple indicators and have been thoroughly backtested for multiple tickers over a range of periods in order to consistently produce a profit.", "A true performant, reliable trading strategy is very hard to craft and you cannot rely on just one chart to tell you everything you need to know. And as a risk-aware individual, I personally find the best use of my time and effort to be constantly investing in index funds rather than timing the market.", "Moral of the story: make an informed decision for yourself now that you have access to the structure of how to backtest indicators in Python. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed!", "By the way, if you would like to backtest these same indicators without code, you can check out this website I created to help investors (it may take some time to initially load up because it is deployed on Heroku).", "Disclaimer: The material in this article is purely for educational purposes and should not be taken as professional investment advice. Invest at your own discretion.", "If you enjoyed this article, check out some of my other Python for Finance articles below!", "Your home for data science.
