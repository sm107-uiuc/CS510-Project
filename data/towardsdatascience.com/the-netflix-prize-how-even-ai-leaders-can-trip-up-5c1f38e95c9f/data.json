But that\u2019s only a small piece of how it uses AI. Like others, it uses AI & sophisticated analytics across the organisation.", "It\u2019s been at the leading edge of AI for many years. But in 2009 it inadvertently scored a high profile AI own-goal. This was the Netflix Competition, something they\u2019d run since 2006.", "The episode has become part of AI folklore, but the lessons are still relevant today. They\u2019re especially pertinent if you\u2019re new to AI, or complacent about the risks and pitfalls of AI in business.", "In 2006, Netflix still provided movies on DVD as well as online. Part of its success came from its sophisticated recommendation system, Cinematch. This suggested to customers what they might like to order next, based on viewer choices and ratings.", "Over the first 6 years of use, Cinematch had improved in its accuracy. But had reached a point where it was no longer getting substantially better.", "To grow the business further, Netflix decided it needed to further improve recommendations. It defined business success with a specific metric: the accuracy of its viewer recommendations.", "To improve this metric, it did three things:", "There were various conditions and details attached to the competition. But that was the essence of their plan to improve recommendation accuracy. So over a decade ago, a high profile use of AI to solve a problem critical to business growth.", "Teams of researchers, academics, and scientists from around the world entered the Netflix Prize competition. But few made significant progress against Netflix\u2019s own highly effective recommendation system. In 2007 around 20,000 teams entered, and double that in 2008.", "Of those, only 3 teams achieved results better than Cinematch in each year. But none did enough to trigger the top prize. There were, however, smaller prizes for progress. If you\u2019re interested in the maths and data science, check out Simon Funk\u2019s entry.", "Finally, in 2009, two teams not only beat Cinematch but beat it by the required 10%. They also met all the other Netflix Prize conditions. The teams went head-to-head in a sort of AI penalty shoot-out in September of that year.", "In the spirit of penalty shoot-outs, the win was remarkably close. The runners up, \u201cThe Ensemble\u201d, actually matched the result of the winners. But \u201cBellKor\u2019s Pragmatic Chaos\u201d took the Netflix Prize, because they submitted their results 20 minutes earlier!", "Being part of the movie business, Netflix followed up its success by announcing a sequel. And of course, they made it bigger and better. To quote their announcement, they would provide a new, more complex data set:", "\u201cThe new data set . . . will include, among other things, information about renters\u2019 ages, genders, ZIP codes, genre ratings and previously chosen movies.\u201d", "As before, Netflix would take stringent measures to protect customer data", "\u201cAs with the first Netflix Prize, all data provided is anonymous and cannot be associated with a specific Netflix member.\u201d", "Unfortunately, two US researchers had already scuppered the sequel by then. They\u2019d been able to identify Netflix users in the anonymised test data used for the first Netflix Prize. They did this by correlating it against other publicly available movie review data. In this case, the data came from the IMDb movie database.", "By the end of 2009, four Netflix users had filed a class-action lawsuit against Netflix. The following year regulatory pressure appeared, in the form of the FTC.", "The lawsuit was eventually settled and dismissed. But the damage was done, and the second Netflix Prize competition never took place.", "A couple of years later, the company announced the demise of the competition. It had decided not to implement the winning algorithm and had no plans to do so.", "From the outside, it appears plausible that the lawsuit would have been a factor in the decision. However, Netflix gave two other reasons instead, both of which are instructive:", "Some see this as a case study in how life can seem unfair. By many accounts, Netflix was diligent in its efforts to be responsible for its use and protection of customer data. It had also made many direct and indirect contributions to the AI community. And yet it ended up accused of illegally releasing customer data and potentially breaching fair trade laws.", "Data privacy advocates disagree of course. From their perspective, the right result prevailed.", "There are strong arguments in support of both positions.", "But the key lessons for business today are not really about who was right and wrong. Instead, there are three more unequivocal points to consider:", "This article is based on a piece first published on www.aiprescience.com", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "CEO of AI research & consulting firm AI Prescience.
