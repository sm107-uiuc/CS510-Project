Its library Pandas is the one you cannot, and more importantly, shouldn\u2019t avoid.", "While Pandas by itself isn\u2019t that difficult to learn, mainly due to the self-explanatory method names, having a cheat sheet is still worthy, especially if you want to code out something quickly. That\u2019s why today I want to put the focus on how I use Pandas to do Exploratory Data Analysis by providing you with the list of my most used methods and also a detailed explanation of those.", "I don\u2019t want to dwell too much with the intro, so I\u2019ll just quickly go over the dataset used and then we\u2019ll jump into the good stuff.", "There\u2019s no need to use complex datasets to demonstrate simple ideas, so with that in mind, I decided to use the Iris dataset. If you decide to follow along with the code you can find the dataset on this link.", "Here\u2019s how to import the Pandas library and load in the dataset:", "Okay, let\u2019s not waste any more time and see how the EDA process typically looks like, Pandas-wise.", "I decided to put those 3 into the same bucket because the main idea behind them is the same \u2014 and that\u2019s to see how the data looks like without visualizing it.", "Without any kind of doubt, I can say that these 3 methods are among the first one I use, with the focus on the last one, because of both head() and tail() might be misleading if you\u2019re dealing with sequential data.", "Anyhow, here\u2019s how to use them on our dataset:", "With the last one, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get the same results \u2014 due to random effect \u2014 nothing wrong there.", "There\u2019s not much more to say about these three methods, use them to get a first look at your data, but for nothing more.", "If there\u2019s one thing you do over and over again in the process of exploratory data analysis \u2014 that\u2019s performing a statistical summary for every (or almost every) attribute.", "It would be a quite tedious process without the right tools \u2014 but thankfully Pandas is here to do the heavy lifting for you. The describe() method will do a quick statistical summary for every numerical column, as shown below:", "As this is a Pandas DataFrame in a nutshell, there\u2019s no one forcing you to keep every statistical value. Here\u2019s how you\u2019d go about keeping only the mean, median, and standard deviation:", "Note how I\u2019m using the transpose operator to switch from columns to rows, and vice-versa.", "I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s no doubt about the purposes of these two methods after just reading their names, but nevertheless, they can prove to be worthy in the process of exploratory data analysis.", "I use them often after conducting a statistical summary of the dataset, to check if some attribute of interest contains extremes or is fairly static on the other hand.", "Let\u2019s see how we\u2019d go about finding the 5 observations with the smallest value of sepal_width:", "And on the other end of the spectrum, here\u2019s how to find 5 elements with the largest value of petal_width:", "And that\u2019s pretty much it \u2014 nothing more to say here.", "Missing values are a big part of data analysis, there\u2019s no doubt about it. It\u2019s very unlikely that every observation will be available at each point of time, and the reasons for it can be many \u2014 from some domain-specific reason to simple human error.", "A part of every Exploratory data analysis process is, therefore, testing for missing values and figuring out how to deal with them.", "Pandas library has you covered here also. We can check for missing values on entire DataFrame:", "Now the Iris dataset is completely free of missing values, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can explore further.", "Because of how Python evaluates True as 1 and False as 0 we can use the sum() function to get some concrete numbers instead of this DataFrame of booleans from above:", "Now, this is much more pleasant to look at. There\u2019s nothing stopping us from using the sum() function again, if we want to check for the total number of missing values in the entire dataset, rather than in particular column:", "If you\u2019re looking for a method capable of telling you how many observations are there for a single possible option of an attribute, look no further.", "The value_counts() method can do all of that for you, but also more with the option to account for missing values, or even to display results as a percentage.", "Now you wouldn\u2019t use this method on the entire DataFrame, but on a single attribute instead. Here\u2019s an example:", "Another important idea reveals here \u2014 it\u2019s best to use this method on a categorical attribute, that is if you care about the concise output. If you\u2019re not that lucky you can refer to methods like cut() for transforming continuous variables into categorical.", "If your attribute contains missing values, value_counts() won\u2019t account for them automatically \u2014 you need to specify that:", "Similarly, sometimes it\u2019s nice to get the percentages returned instead of plan integers \u2014 makes it easier to present results to someone:", "I hope this article will point you in the right direction when it comes to Python, Pandas, and Exploratory Data Analysis in general.", "Personally, I don\u2019t use many more methods in real projects, but the trick is to do proper data manipulation and transformation beforehand. Analysis itself then becomes trivial.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
