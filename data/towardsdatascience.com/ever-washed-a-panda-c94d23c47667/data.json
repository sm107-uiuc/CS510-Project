Starting with a great goal in mind can be a great motivator, but beware the dangers of skipping over one of the most important parts of any project: the data cleaning. It may not be flashy, you may not be saving the world, but in the words of one wiser than I:", "Really getting to know a dataset before rushing into predictions is the best way to form a healthy, lasting relationship.", "Trust me, data rewards us for slowing down to consider things from all angles. Let\u2019s ask some basic questions: When we look at our data what do we see? Should we be seeing that? What is each column\u2019s intended meaning? Are the values meant to be taken literally or are they categorical? How do the values in the column relate to the values in other columns? I know these might seem like ridiculously simple questions, but starting small can help you catch things you might otherwise miss if you were in a hurry. You might be surprised how simple questions can lead to more complicated ones.", "All right, it\u2019s time put on our raincoats, grab a sponge and a squeegee, and get a little dirty.", "For the purposes of this exercise, we\u2019ll say I\u2019m trying to predict game scores based on the available data.

First off, it looks like this csv file has it\u2019s own index column. Keeping both would be redundant, so let\u2019s get rid of ours by specifically calling the csv index column.", "2. What is each column\u2019s intended meaning? Are the values meant to be taken literally or are they categorical?", "We have two possible columns which include scores: score_phrase, which looks like text, and score, which appears numeric. In context, both of these columns seem to be representing categorical data. Let\u2019s take a look at their data types and values:", "So it looks like score_phrase has 11 different text values, which can easily be converted to 11 number rankings. score appears to be a number ranking system, going from 0 to 10. Now it\u2019s time to make a decision. Do I use score? score_phrase? or a mixture of the two? Let\u2019s get some more information before making a decision.", "It seems strange to include both a score and score_phrase column in the same dataset. I would hypothesize that score_phrase might be based on the scores from the score column, let\u2019s find out. Below I\u2019ll look up rows in the dataframe for Disaster, to see what the values in the score column are. I\u2019ll do the same for all the unique values of score_phrase.", "To be sure let\u2019s look at our results in a box plot with 0 representing Disaster and 10 representing Masterpiece:", "It looks like the values in the score column directly affect the score_phrase values, so we can do away with the score_phrase column altogether.", "Now let\u2019s take another look at our dataframe:", "It appears that the editors_choice column is also a binary yes or no column. Let\u2019s turn it into zeroes and ones to make it easier to work with.", "Now that we\u2019ve done the more obvious things, it\u2019s time to make more thoughtful decisions. What is useful information for making our predictions? The title? While titles are definitely important, I don\u2019t think they affect the ratings, only the discovery of the games. The URL? that\u2019s just a tool for people using the data set to learn more about each. What about the platform? Does the platform you release your game on effect your rating? I would say yes. Let\u2019s trim it down a little bit more.", "What about those different columns for year, month, and day? Would it be better to put those into a single datetime column? How should we treat the different values of the platform column? What about the genre? These are all great questions going forward, and it\u2019s important to ask and answer not just these, but even more questions about your dataset. Once you\u2019ve finally cleaned everything up and fully understand the data, then and only then should you proceed.", "Your home for data science.
