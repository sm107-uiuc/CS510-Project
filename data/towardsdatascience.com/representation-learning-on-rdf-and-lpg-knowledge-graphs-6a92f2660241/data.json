Language Modeling, Information Extraction, and even playing text RPGs with Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, KGs are already widely adopted in the industry, e.g., a line-up of works from the recent Knowledge Graph Conference (KGC)", "Traditionally, KGs are encoded as <subject, predicate, object> (RDF) triples, and many publicly available KGs like DBpedia and YAGO initially followed this paradigm backed by expressive logical formalisms (remember the times when DL referred to Description Logics ? \ud83d\udc75) and standards like RDF and OWL.", "Using triples, the above example describing which universities Albert Einstein attended can be encoded as two triples:", "Well, it looks okayish for simple applications but turns out our world is a bit more complex to fit everything into triples. For instance, do the two triples imply that Albert Einstein was educated at the two places simultaneously? Or they awarded him with the same degree?", "In fact, Einstein received a Bachelor\u2019s degree at ETH Zurich with a major in mathematics, whereas at the University of Zurich he obtained a doctoral degree with a major in physics.", "Can we have a mechanism to express facts in more detail?", "Yes! In the KG world, there are at least two ways to do that \u2014 RDF* Graphs and Labeled Property Graphs (LPG). Both of them allow instantiating each fact further by attaching auxiliary key-value (relation-entity) pairs to edges in a KG. And both of them are already supported by major vendors on the graph databases market \ud83d\udc4d.", "In the LPG world, both nodes and edges can naturally have key-value attributes. Neo4j is probably the biggest name in the LPG family. You can query LPGs with (Open)Cypher. A recent COVID-19 KG is available as a Neo4j dump.", "RDF* originally proposed by Olaf Hartig (his blog is a good starting source to get into RDF* and related tech) aims to alleviate many issues of the infamous RDF reification mechanism (check out this survey by Frey et al for a comprehensive overview of reification) while retaining reasoning capabilities pertaining to RDF graphs. Backed by solid theoretical foundations, RDF* provides a handful of ways to enrich triples with more details. You can query RDF* graphs with SPARQL* (an extension of SPARQL for working with RDF*). Apache Jena, RDF4J, N3.js, Blazegraph, AnzoGraph, Stardog, and GraphDB support RDF* and SPARQL*", "Our example in the RDF* syntax can look like this:", "What is a suitable term for such KGs? There was a small vocabulary gap until Rosso et al in their recent WWW\u201920 work suggested using \u201chyper-relational graph\u201d. Still, there is a common misuse of the term \u201chypergraph\u201d. We\u2019d like to advocate for \u201chyper-relational\u201d graphs as well. \ud83e\udd1d", "The main difference is in the representation of a fact. Hypergraphs assume there is one (named) hyper-edge unifying several entities:", "Looks like an n-ary relation, right? \ud83e\udd28 We have several problems here:", "2. Moreover, we also lose the auxiliary character of degrees and majors, i.e., they are intended to describe their main triples. For example, Bachelor and Mathematics are auxiliary wrt Albert Einstein and ETH Zurich and, hence, should be treated in this manner. A tuple of entities in a hyper-edge assumes equal importance of its elements.", "That said, in the following parts we\u2019ll adhere to hyper-relational approaches.", "In 2020, most of the open-domain KGs widely use hyper-relational facts. Wikidata and its Wikidata Statements model is a good example of a hyper-relational KG. Each fact in Wikidata is a Statement with the main triple and a set of auxiliary qualifiers \u2014 entity-relation pairs. With Wikidata statements our Albert Einstein example can be modeled as easy as following:", "In those statements, (academic_degree, Bachelor) and (academic_major, Mathematics) are qualifiers for the triple <Albert Einstein, educated_at, ETH Zurich>.", "It\u2019s important to notice that Wikidata (and generally the hyper-relational paradigm) does not separate between entities and predicates used exclusively in the main triples or qualifiers, i.e.,", "all predicates and entities can be used either in triple terms or qualifiers", "(albeit there can be some entities and relations seen only in qualifiers in the current Wikidata version). We will use this property in the following sections.", "As to other KGs, starting from 2018, new releases of DBpedia contain reified statements similar to those in Wikidata. YAGO 4 adopted RDF* encoding of the facts as well. \ud83d\ude4c", "What about Freebase? \ud83e\udd14 Well, in 2020 you should probably not practice necromancy \ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f as Freebase is no longer supported nor updated. However, Compound Value Types (CVT) nodes in Freebase do resemble reification of triples [but look more like n-ary relations]", "Our task here is to learn representations of hyper-relational graphs.", "By representations we refer to entity (node) and relation (typed edge) embeddings. The embeddings can then be used in downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, entity alignment, and many more that can be used in NLP, CV, and other AI areas. \ud83c\udf40", "The field of graph representation learning (GRL) is one of the fastest-growing \ud83d\ude80 areas of machine learning, there is a handful of articles (a series of posts by Michael Bronstein, reviews (mine, Sergey\u2019s) from ICLR\u201920 and NeurIPS\u201919 papers), books (by William Hamilton, by Ma and Tang), courses (CS224W, COMP 766, ESE 680), and even a GraphML Telegram channel (subscribe \ud83d\ude09) covering basic and advanced topics.", "In the encoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder is usually a GNN (graph neural net), and a decoder is a function of embeddings that returns a value or a vector pertaining to a certain downstream task, e.g., a probability of an entity being an object of a given <subject, predicate> pair.", "Encoders: a family of multi-relational GNN encoders like R-GCN (Schlichtkrull et al, ESWC 2018) and CompGCN (Vashishth et al, ICLR 2020) that extend the original Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm within a message passing framework.", "Decoders: actually, traditional KG embedding algorithms like TransE, ConvE, RotatE, etc are good examples of decoders for the link prediction task.

We then apply a permutation invariant aggregation function (sum, although we also probed multiplication) to pool an arbitrary number of qualifiers into a single vector and finally project it through a transformation matrix W_q.", "Since all entities and relations can be generally seen in main triples as well as qualifiers, W_q is intended to learn qualifier-specific representations of entities and relations.", "We still retain CompGCN components: phi_() is a composition function similar to phi_q(), but now it merges a node with an enriched edge representation.

Our main research question:", "Do qualifiers help to predict subjects and objects of hyper-relational facts?", "That is, given subject, predicate, and all qualifiers we predict the object or vice versa for a subject. For that, we linearize a given fact into a sequence as shown in the illustration and use a 2-layer Transformer with avg pooling and a final FC layer as a decoder.", "The Transformer also allows us to feed sequences of different lengths using padding tokens which are masked \ud83d\udc7a from the self-attention computations.", "For comparison, we applied decoder-only HINGE and 2-layer Transformer on the same task to measure if the StarE encoder brings any benefits there.", "Well, turns out it does! \ud83c\udf86", "How many qualifiers do you need to see the quality improve?
