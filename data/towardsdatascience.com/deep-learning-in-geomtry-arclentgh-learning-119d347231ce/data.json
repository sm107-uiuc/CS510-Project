For example, a handwritten signature involves the computation of the length along the curve (Ooi et al.). When one handles the challenge of length computation in real-life problems he faces several constraints such as additive noise, discretization error, and partial information. In this post, we review our work, a preprint is available online:", "In this current work, we address a fundamental question in the field of geometry where we aim to reconstruct a basic property using DNN. The simplest geometric object is a curve, and a simple metric to evaluate a curve is the length. There are many close form expressions for calculation of the length and other geometric properties in the classical literature (Kimmel, 2003). However, since we know the powerful functions of DNN, we are highly motivated to reconstruct the length of curve (arclength) property by designing a DNN. For simplicity, we focused on the two-dimensional Euclidean domain.", "So, before we dive into the machine learning formulation, let\u2019s briefly review the length property. The general equation of the Euclidean length of a 2D curve C is given by", "The main length\u2019s axioms are additivity, invariant, monotonic, and non-negativity. The length additives with respect to concatenation, invariant with respect to rotation and translation, it is monotone and by definition, the length of any curve is non-negative.", "In order to find the length of a continuous curve, it should be discretized. The discretization process involves error. For example, let\u2019s look at the blue curve. A rough discretization of this curve can lead to the orange discretized curve. Obviously, dividing the curve into many infinitesimal lines minimizes the discretization error.", "Among the discretization error, we can find additive noise, partial information, and many others that occur due to nonlinearity and derivatives involved in the length equation (1).", "So, how do we formulate it as a learning task?", "We tackled this problem in a supervised learning approach with a unique loss function that satisfies the length axioms. The resulted trained model was called ArcLengthNet. It obtains a 2D vector as an input, represents the planar Euclidean sampled curve, and outputs their respective length. We created a dataset with 20,000 examples to fully enable DNN training. This large amount of examples aimed to cover curve transformations and to satisfy different patterns. A general curve in our data is given by", "where R is a rotation matrix, T is a translation vector, a is amplitude, and phi is the phase.", "A unique loss function was designed:", "where s1, s2, and s3 are the input curves that hold the equality L(s1) = L(s2) + L(s3), O is the DNN output, k is the example index, lambda is a regularization parameter, and ij are the various DNN weights. Passing the examples through a model tunes the weights:", "The architecture: a simplified CNN-based architecture was designed. It includes a convolutional layer and two fully-connected layers with only one activation function. Each curve is represented by N = 200 points. This representation is inserted into a convolutional layer with a small kernel of size 3. It is processed into a fully connected layer that outputs only 10 weights through a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to another fully connected layer which finally outputs the length.", "The DNN was trained by passing many examples in small batches with a backpropagation method. The training process was carried out in batches of 200 examples for 100 epochs. The optimizer we used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum and weight decay.", "The model was well trained after 100 epochs. A holdout set was defined to test the performance of the architectures on unseen data. This set contains 5,000 examples that have not been used in the train set or test set. The ArcLengthNet obtained a minimum MSE of 0.17. The monotonic property was tested for the ArcLengthNet on this holdout set, where a linear relation was established between the true length and the ArcLengthNet:", "A learning-based approach to reconstruct the length of curves was presented. The power of deep neural networks to reconstruct the fundamental axioms was demonstrated. The results can be further used to improve handwritten signatures and reconstruct some more differential geometry properties and theorems.
