Such disruption brings many challenges for professionals and businesses. In this article, I will provide an introduction to one of the most commonly used machine learning methods, K-Means.", "Machine learning is a scientific method that utilizes statistical methods along with the computational power of machines to convert data to wisdom that humans or the machine itself can use for taking certain actions. \u201cIt is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\u201d (SaS)", "If you think ML is a new paradigm you should know that the name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. However, this came after a proposal by Alan Turing in 1950s in he replaced \u201cCan machines think?\u201d with \u201cCan machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\u201d, or in other words, \u201ccan machines learn?\u201d", "So, ML has been around for half a century. However, with the recent advancements in computational power of machines, and also the shear amount of data that we are generating, collecting and storing, ML has surfaced as the next big thing in many industries.", "There are many fields in ML, but we can name the three main fields as:", "Supervised Learning (SL): SL is when the ML model is built and trained using a set of inputs (predictors) and desired outputs (target). Many of regression (either simple or multi-) or classification models fall under this category.", "Unsupervised Learning (UL): UL is used when the target is not know and the objective is to infer patterns or trends in the data that can inform a decision, or sometimes covert the problem to a SL problem (Also known as Transfer Learning , TL). This article is focused on UL clustering, and specifically, K-Means method.", "Reinforcement Learning (RL): This paradigm is a more complex than SL and UL, however this article provides a simple, yet technical definition of RL. Generally, RL is concerned with how a \u201cagent\u201d (e.g. a model) takes actions in an environment and in each step attempts to to maximize a reward (e.g. an optimization function). A good example for RL is route optimization using genetic algorithm and brute-force (more on this in later articles).", "The graphic below by Abdul Wahid nicely show these main areas of ML.", "k-means clustering is a method from signal processing, with the objective of putting the observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to a cluster with the nearest mean. These clusters are also called Voronoi cells in mathematics.", "Before getting into the details of Python codes, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of K-Means clustering.", "The main input to the clustering algorithm is the number of clusters (herein called k). k determines the clustering mechanism, and how the clusters form. It could be challenging to come up with the number of clusters before you know which should belong to a cluster, and especially because you are dealing with an unsupervised learning problem.", "There are other unsupervised learning methods to determine the right number of clusters for a K-Means clustering method, including Hierarchical Clustering, but we are not getting into that topic in this article. Our assumption is that you know the number of clusters, or have a general sense of the right number of clusters. The best approach would be to do a couple of trial/errors to find the best number of clusters.", "Once you know the number of clusters, there are three different ways to assign the cluster centers:", "The latter selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. You can find more on this here.", "It should be noted that the initial cluster centers do have any effects on the final clustering results, for reasons that are explained next. Given the initial cluster centers, the algorithm repeats the following steps until it converges:", "One thing to keep in mind is that K-Means almost always converges, but is not guaranteed to find the most optimum solution, because it terminates the cycle at a local minimum and may not reach the global minimum state.", "Alright! Enough about the algorithm. Let\u2019s get to the exciting part which is the Python code.", "Since K-Means works based on the distance of data points to a cluster center, scaling of data to the same scale is critical to the accuracy of the results.", "We are going to use SciKit Learn library for this purpose. You can read the documentation for the K-Means clustering package here.", "To illustrate how this algorithm works, we are going to use the make_blob package in sklearn.datasets. The code snipper below will generate 5 clusters. We will not be using the cluster designations (y) here for our clustering.", "Let\u2019s visualize the clusters to see where they are.", "Looking at the blobs, we can see that we have three different \u201czones\u201d, consisting of 5 blobs:", "Let\u2019s see how K-Means clustering can handle this. We are going to look at different cluster numbers, between 1 and 10. The code is provided below, and the resulting graphs are put together in an animation below.", "The animated plot was made using Image.Io package. For more information on this refer to Johannes Huessy blog (Click Here).", "So you have done the clustering, but how good is this clustering, and how can you measure the performance of the algorithm?", "Inertia: We talked about one metric in the previous section, which is the within-cluster sum of squares of distances to the cluster center. This is called \u201cinertia\u201d. The algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimize the inertia, which can be recognized as a measure of how internally coherent clusters are.", "You can use the following code to get the inertia score for the clusters:", "The code below calculates the inertia score for the 10 different cluster numbers we did before, and saves them in a list that we use to plot (more on this later). The plot of inertial score vs the number of clusters is called the \u201cElbow Curve\u201d.", "Silhouette Score: Silhouette score is based on a combination of cluster Cohesion (how close points in a cluster are relative to each other) and Separation (how far the clusters are relative to each other).", "Silhouette score is between -1 (poor clustering) and +1 (excellent clustering).", "Now that we have the inertia and silhouetter scores, let\u2019s plot them and evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.", "You can see that the inertia score always drops when you increase the number of clusters. However, the elbow curve can tell you above 4 clusters, the change in the inertia was not significant. Now, let\u2019s look at the silhouette curve. You can see that the maximum score happens at 4 clusters (the higher the silhouette score, the better the clustering).", "Coupling the elbow curve with the silhouette score curve provides invaluable insight into the performance of K-Means.", "K-Means method has many use cases, from image vectorization to text document clustering. You can find some examples here.", "I hope you found this guide useful in understanding the K-Means clustering method using Python\u2019s SkLearn package.
