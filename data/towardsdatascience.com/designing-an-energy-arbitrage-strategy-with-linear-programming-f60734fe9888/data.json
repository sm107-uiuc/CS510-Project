To successfully execute any temporal arbitrage strategy, some amount of confidence in future prices is required, to be able to expect to make a profit. In the case of energy arbitrage, the constraints of the energy storage system must also be considered. For example, batteries have limited capacity, limited rate of charging, and are not 100% efficient in that not all of the energy used to charge a battery will be available later for discharge.", "The goal of this post is to illustrate how the mathematical optimization technique of linear programming can be used to design an operating strategy for a grid-connected battery with a given set of operational constraints, under the assumption of known future prices. All of this will be done using real-world energy price data and open source tools in Python. The Jupyter notebook is available here.", "The task is to formulate an operation strategy for a grid connected battery system, to perform energy arbitrage on the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) day-ahead market. What is the NYISO? According to their website,", "The NYISO is the New York Independent System Operator \u2014 the organization responsible for managing New York\u2019s electric grid and its competitive wholesale electric marketplace.", "The NYISO makes the next day\u2019s hourly energy prices available at 11am each day (NYISO 2019, references available at bottom of page). The battery system we design here will schedule the next 24 hours of battery operation (noon of the current day through the 11am hour of the next day) using this information. We will assume that after the daily price announcement from the NYISO, the next 36 hours of price information are available: the prices for the remaining 12 hours of the current day, as well as 24 hours worth of prices for the next day. Therefore the optimization time horizon will be 36 hours, to take advantage of all available future price information.", "Since the operational schedule will be repeated each day, the last 12 hours of the 36 hour strategy will always be ignored. This is because new price information will become available at 11am the following day, which we can take advantage of. However these \u201cextra 12 hours\u201d of data are not wasted; I determined in initial experiments that having a 36 hour time horizon creates a more profitable arbitrage strategy than shorter horizons. This makes intuitive sense, because the more future information we can incorporate into the arbitrage strategy, the more profitable it should be. You can experiment with different horizons using the code below, although the horizon is assumed to be at least 24 hours here. The plan can be visualized as follows:", "The battery is said to be a price taker, meaning its activities do not affect the price of energy. The price paid for power to charge the battery, and revenue from discharging, is the location based marginal price (LBMP), which takes in to account the system marginal price, congestion component, and marginal loss component (PJM Interconnection LLC). The goal is to maximize profit, given the day-ahead prices and the battery system\u2019s parameters.", "In this scenario, where future prices are known and the battery system is a price taker, the problem of designing an operational strategy can be solved by linear programming (Salles et al. 2017, Sioshansi et al. 2009, Wang and Zhang 2018). In brief summary, linear programming is a well-known technique for either maximizing or minimizing some objective. In this case, we want to maximize profit. As long as the mathematical function describing the objective, known as the objective function, as well as the constraints of the system, can all be described as linear combinations of the decision variables, which define the operational strategy, linear programming can be used to optimize the system.", "Loosely following the notation of Sioshansi et al. (2009), here we\u2019ll lay out the decision variables and add the contraints to a linear programming model in PuLP. Starting with the class definition in the cell after next, the markdown code snippets in this section should all be put together to define a class, which describes our battery system (see the notebook for confirmation). This model of the system will be useful to simulate battery operation, stepping through time at a daily increment.", "Before proceeding further let\u2019s import the packages needed for this exercise.", "Each day, a single optimization problem needs to be solved between 11am and 12pm, which will provide sufficient information to guide the battery\u2019s operation for the next 36 hours. To guide the battery\u2019s operation, we need to decide what the flow of energy will be for each discrete time step in the time horizon. Energy flows, also known as electrical power, can either be into or out of the battery. So we\u2019ll create two decision variables, c_t and d_t, as the charging and discharging power flows, respectively (kW), at time t, which will be an hourly time step. The rates of charge or discharge are continuous variables and are bounded to be within the operating limits of the battery, for all time steps:", "where \u03ba (kW) is the maximum charge and discharge power capacity, which we\u2019ll assume are equal here.", "We need to specify flow variables for each time step in the time horizon of optimization. PuLP provides a handy method dicts of the LpVariable class, which we can use to create charge and discharge flows for all time steps at once. We'll start defining a class that will hold all the information governing the operation of the battery. The input time_horizon is an integer specifiying the number of hours in the optimization horizon, assumed here to be at least 24, and the other inputs are as described above:", "After setting up all the decision variables, it\u2019s time to define the optimization problem that PuLP will solve for us. Our goal is to maximize profit P within the optimization time horizon, which can be defined as follows using charge flows and the price of energy:", "where p_t is the LBMP ($/MWh) at time t. In terms of units, because t is an hourly time step, it effectively cancels the per hour part of the units of the LBMP. The objective function is divided by 1000 to account for the discrepancy in units (MW/kW), so ultimately the objective of profit will be in units of dollars. We\u2019ll make this unit correction after running the simulation, so it won\u2019t be reflected in the code here.", "The objective function is specified by adding the decision variables to the model object in PuLP, multiplying each by the appropriate cost or revenue that would come from charging or discharging that amount of energy. This multiplication of decision variables by prices is accomplished using an LpAffineExpression. The prices are determined by the LBMP, which we'll select for the relevant time period when we run the simulation. For example, with a 36 hour time horizon, this would be noon the current day, through the 11pm hour the next day.", "Having defined the model and the objective, now we need to add the battery\u2019s operational constraints. The battery has limited capacity and so the optimization is subject to a battery storage constraint:", "where t_f = each hour from 1pm on the current day through 11pm the next day, s_i is the state of energy (kWh) of the battery at the start of the 36-hour optimization period and \u03b7 is the round-trip efficiency of the battery. This constraint requires the battery\u2019s state of energy (sum of initial state and hourly power flows) to be between zero, assuming the battery has complete depth of discharge capabilities, and the battery\u2019s discharge energy capacity, for each hour of the optimization horizon. In this constraint, the power flows (kW) are understood to be converted to units of energy (kWh) through multiplication by the one hour time step.", "In PuLP, constraints can be added to a model just like the objective function: using addition syntax. We can express these constraints by adding up the discharge flows using lpSum, and in the case of charge flows which need to be multiplied by efficiency, again an LpAffineExpression.", "Maximum daily discharged throughput \u03c4 (kWh) is also constrained, which limits the amount of energy that can flow through the battery in a given day. We set this up so that the first day of the time horizon is subject to a 24 hour constraint, and whatever portion beyond that is subject to a fractional constraint. For example, in our 36 hour horizon, the constraints would be:", "Now that we\u2019ve set up the model with an objective function and all constraints, we include methods to solve the problem, and report back the results, which are the optimal charge and discharge flows for each hour in the time horizon. As long as the problem we set up is feasible in terms of the constraints we\u2019ve indicated, linear programming should work in that it will find an optimal solution, that maximizes profit. However if not, we will return a message indicating this.", "This completes the Battery class. We are now ready to ingest the data and proceed to simulating battery operation.", "We obtain one year\u2019s worth of LBMPs, so we can simulate the battery\u2019s operation over this period of time. The data is available as LBMPs for several zones, at an hourly time step. Here we load the CSV files (one per day) and concatenate them on to a DataFrame. You can obtain these data from the git repo accompanying this blog post. The data were downloaded from here on May 2, 2020, as zipped directories of CSV files (Pricing Data, Day-Ahead Market (DAM) LBMP, Zonal P-2A).", "Loop through all the subdirectories, loading all the CSV files.", "Sanity checks on data.

We can check that all the constraints were satisfied, and analyze the financial impact of our system.", "Define power output with discharging as positive and charging as negative.", "This indicates that for most hours over the year, the power is close to zero. In other words, the battery is neither charging nor discharging. However, it is also common for the battery to be operating at the limits of its range [-100, 100] kW.", "The battery state of energy should be no less than zero, and no greater than the discharge energy capacity, at any time: [0, 200] kWh.", "Results indicate the battery is operating within the prescribed limits of state of energy.", "We\u2019ll analyze the following financial indicators:", "We\u2019ll also look at the total annual discharged throughput (kWh) later.

A plot of the LBMP throughout the year sheds some light on this:", "Changes in price enable the arbitrage strategy to make a profit. Generally, most of the larger price swings are during the summer months, probably reflecting increased demand due to air conditioning usage on hot summer days. But there are large price changes in November, December, and January. This may be due to tourism in New York City during the holiday season or cold weather that increases the demand for electricity for heating.", "We found that an energy arbitrage strategy for a grid-connected battery can be formulated using linear programming, assuming future prices are known over some time horizon. We showed that when operating under an illustrative set of system parameters and using real-world energy price data, such a system can generate an annual profit of $963.", "Further optimization for increased profit may be possible if prices are able to be accurately predicted beyond the 36 hour optimization horizon used here. The NYISO price determination involves a load forecasting model, that depends on economic and weather factors. It may be possible to include such factors in a price forecasting model to estimate future day-ahead market prices that are not yet public.
