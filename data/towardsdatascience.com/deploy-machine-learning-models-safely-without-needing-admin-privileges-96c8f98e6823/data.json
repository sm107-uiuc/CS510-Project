The machine learning project you spearheaded at work is complete. You\u2019ve spent months discussing business problems with stakeholders, translating business questions into data questions, acquiring and exploring data, cleaning said data when you saw what a mess it was, choosing an appropriate metric, and building and tuning a machine learning model that gives you great results. You\u2019re finished!", "Except\u2026 you don\u2019t work for a tech giant, your colleagues aren\u2019t programmers, and you\u2019re the only one who knows how to actually get predictions from the model you built. You probably don\u2019t want to want to spend the foreseeable future exporting and emailing CSV files, but you definitely can\u2019t set up your model and the associated personally identifiable information on a public-facing cloud-based service. It also goes without saying that you are not trusted with admin credentials, you\u2019re not allowed to have your own web server secured behind your organization\u2019s single sign on portal, and you there\u2019s no money in the budget for an enterprise solution.", "You began this project with the goal of helping your teammates do their jobs more efficiently, more effectively, and less expensively \u2014 but they need to actually use what you built for any of this to happen. This post will walk through how to ship a Dash app to your colleagues without needing admin credentials, and how to remove friction so they can easily use it.", "I use Poetry to create virtual environments and manage dependencies for my projects. It works well on Windows, and the documentation is great. Installing your exact dependencies on other computers is as easy as sharing your pyproject.toml file.", "The rest of this guide assumes you use Poetry, too.", "Dash, in combination with Plotly, makes it easy to create web apps with interactive visualizations to explore and export results of machine learning models.", "As an example, I built a web app that allows end users to control a number of inputs to the model and export the results. Users can change: fiscal years to model, the decision threshold for binary classification models, and minimum and maximum giving/sales thresholds. The app also shows where people are on a scatter map and allows end users to select people to export by geography. Each figure in the app updates instantly whenever anything in the control box is changed.", "The end product makes it easy for non-technical people to get results from machine learning models and use the results in their own workflows.", "Details of how to build a Dash app are beyond the scope of this post, but I will explain how I did it in a future post.", "Unfortunately, there\u2019s no getting around the initial time investment of guiding your coworkers through installing Python and making sure the path variables are set correctly. But you only need to do this step once, and I promise you that it\u2019s worthwhile.", "A crucial aspect of deploying web apps to non-technical users is reducing the friction involved in launching the product. End users don\u2019t want to remember the commands required to launch the app, and frankly they shouldn\u2019t have to. Launching Dash apps can thankfully be automated by writing a batch script (a file with the suffix .bat)with three lines of code. Copy these commands into a new Notepad file:", "Replace path\\to\\app_script.py with the path from the project\u2019s root directory to the script that launches your Dash app. Save this file in the root directory of your project, and name it something like dashboard.bat.", "This script first opens the default Dash app URL in a new tab of your default web browser, and then runs the Python script containing the Dash app. This means that the web browser will say that the website is unavailable until the Flask server that powers Dash is up and running. Once the server is up (which could take 5\u201310 seconds), users should refresh the browser to load the app.", "Double-click on the batch script you just made to ensure that it works. This file will be your team\u2019s entry point to the app.", "There is some flexibility in this step, depending on how many people are developing the app, how many people you are shipping the app to and how often you plan on updating it. If you\u2019re not the only developer, are sharing with a large team, or will have frequent updates, you\u2019d likely prefer a more automated approach.", "However, I\u2019m the only developer, I\u2019m sharing my web app with five people, and will probably not have more than a few updates per year. I decided to copy the project (which includes Python files, saved XGBoost models, and data files to use with the models) to a Google Drive folder, though any file-sharing service will work similarly.", "The folder\u2019s contents might look something like this:", "Share the folder with all the relevant people, and ask them to download the contents. It might be nice to add a note saying that you\u2019ll walk them through installation soon \ud83d\ude01", "Installing Python and creating virtual environments on Windows computers used to be an exercise in patience (and troubleshooting), but the process has gotten much easier since Microsoft added Python to the Microsoft Store.", "Once your colleagues have Poetry installed, they can download all the dependencies required for your project by using your pyproject.toml file.", "Since your colleagues have all downloaded the files that you shared, it\u2019s time to install your app\u2019s dependencies.", "Your app is now ready to use! Have everyone check that it works by double-clicking on dashboard.bat.", "This approach allows you to send updates to your team pretty painlessly. As long as you don\u2019t introduce new dependencies or change the Python script that launches your Dash app, updating the app is as easy as replacing the project folder with a new version. The batch script will still work, and the dependencies are already installed.", "If you do change the entry point of your Dash app or add dependencies to your app, follow the appropriate steps above for Poetry and/or the batch script.", "This post walks through how to ship machine learning models, in the form of a Dash app, to end users on Windows computers without needing admin credentials.", "There is a decent amount of upfront investment required, especially if you lead a number of people through these steps over Zoom, but consider it an investment in both your future schedule and your team\u2019s effectiveness. End users will be able use machine learning models you spent a long time creating, and you won\u2019t need to handle every request personally.", "Feel free to leave comments below \u2014 I would love to hear about alternative deployment methods you\u2019ve used, or thoughts on anything else in this post.
