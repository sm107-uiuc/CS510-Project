Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Currently, the technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis.", "The goal here is to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how severe the condition may be. We shall be achieving this by building a Convolutional neural network model that can automatically look at a patient\u2019s eye image and estimate the severity of blindness in the patient. This process of automation can reduce a lot of time thereby screening the process of treating diabetic retinopathy at a large scale.", "We are given 3200 eye images and their corresponding severity scale which is one of [0,1,2,3,4]. This data is to be used for training the model and prediction is to be done on the test data.", "Sample eye images in the dataset are below \u2014", "Quadratic weighted kappa measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores assigned by the human rater and the predicted scores.", "To understand this metric, we need to understand the concept of Cohen\u2019s kappa (wikipedia \u2014 link). This metric accounts for the agreement that occurs by chance apart from the agreement that we observe from the Confusion matrix. We can understand this using a simple example \u2014", "Suppose we want to calculate cohen\u2019s kappa from the agreement table below which is basically a confusion matrix. As we can see from the table below, out of total 50 observations, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 raters agree on (20 yes+ 15 no) = 35 observations. So, observed agreement is P(o) = 35/50 = 0.7", "We need to also find what proportion of ratings are due to random chance and not due to an actual agreement between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. As we can see, \u2018A\u2019 said yes 25/50 = 0.5 times, \u2018B\u2019 said yes 30/50 = 0.6 times. So the probability that both of them would say \u2018yes\u2019 simultaneously at random is 0.5*0.6 = 0.3. Similarly, the probability that both of them would say \u2018no\u2019 simultaneously at random is 0.5*0.4 = 0.2. Thus, the probability of random agreement is 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5. Let us call this P(e).", "So, Cohens kappa would be 0.4 (formula below).", "The value we got is 0.4, we can interpret this using the table below. You can read more on interpretation about this metric here in this blog \u2014 https://towardsdatascience.com/inter-rater-agreement-kappas-69cd8b91ff75.", "A value of 0.4 would mean we have a fair/moderate agreement.", "We can extend the same concept when it comes to multi-classes and also introducing the concept of weights here. The intuition behind introducing weights is that they are ordinal variables, which means an agreement between classes \u20181\u2019 and \u20182\u2019 is better than classes \u20181\u2019 and \u20183\u2019, because they are nearer in the ordinal scale. In our blindness severity case, output is ordinal (which is blindness severity, 0 representing no blindness, 4 representing highest). To account for this, Weights in quadratic scale are introduced. The more closer the ordinal classes, the higher are their weights. Here is the link to the blog post that explains this concept very well \u2014 https://medium.com/x8-the-ai-community/kappa-coefficient-for-dummies-84d98b6f13ee.", "As we can see, R1 and R4 have weight of 0.44 (because they are 3 ordinal classes apart compared to R1 and R2 which has weight of 0.94 because they are closer). These weights are multipled by the corresponding probabilities in calculations of probabilities of observed and random chances.", "As we can see, there is class imbalance in the training data-set with most cases having value of \u20180\u2019 and least in \u20181\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 classes.", "These are basically eye retina images taken using fundus photography. As we can see, images contain artifacts, some of them are out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed etc. Also, some of the images have low brightness and low lightning conditions thus making it difficult to assess the difference between the images.", "Below is a sample retina image of an eye that would contain diabetic retinopathy.

In Gaussian Blur operation, the image is convolved with a Gaussian filter which is a low-pass filter that removes the high-frequency components .", "This brilliantly written kernel (link) introduces the idea of circular cropping from gray scale images. Implementing the same in the code section below :-", "As we can see, we are much more clearly able to see the distinctive patterns in the imgaes now.Here are the image processing applied on 15 image samples.", "After applying the above operations, we need to save the new images in the folder that can be used later. The original images are each of around 3 MB, the entire images folder occupies 20 GB space. We can reduce this by resizing images. Using multi core threading / Multi processing, we can achieve this task under a minute. We can use ThreadPool with 6 cores (since I have 8 core CPU) to achieve this and an image size of (512x512) to achive this (IMG_SIZE).", "In order to understand if the images are seperable in the respective classes (blindness severity), We can first use TSNE to visualize the same in 2-dimensions. We can first convert the RGB scale images to Gray scale images and then flatten the images out to generate a vector representation which can be used as a feature representation of that image.", "Perplexity is the hyperparameter that needs to be tuned to get good results. After the iterations, We can use TSNE plot for perplexity = 40.", "As we can see from the above plot, class \u20180\u2019 is somewhat seperable from other classes whereas the distinction between the other classes is still quite vague.", "This is one of the most used procedure to generate robustness in the data by creating additional images from the dataset to make it generalize well on new data with rotation flips, cropping, padding etc. using the keras ImageDataGenerator class", "Above code generates sample images obtained after applying the augmentations \u2014", "One of the Research paper\u2019s found on arXiv.org \u2014 research paper link gets 54th rank out of 2943 (Top 1%) involves a detailed approach of Multi Task learning to solve this problem statement.

This way it can use single Model and since first layers would anyway learn similar features, this architecture is implemented to reduce training time (instead of training 3 seperate models). For the Encoder part, we could use any Existing CNN architecture \u2014 ResNet50, EfficientNetB4, EfficientNetB5 (and ensemble these).", "The code implementation for the above architecture is below (in keras) \u2014", "We need to create a custom ImageDataGenerator function since we have 3 outputs (reference \u2014 link).

Below are the results obtained when implemented on some of them (only Model architecture is changed, other parameters are kept same).", "As we can see, the Training Loss is failing to reduce in the Main Training stage. One of the ways we could deal with this is by changing the optimizer from Adam to Rectified Adam optimizer. (More on RAdam here \u2014 https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/10/07/is-rectified-adam-actually-better-than-adam/). Also, we could experiment with SGD (Momentum) optimizers along with Weight Decay methods, more Learning Rate Schedulers to check for model performance improvements.", "Additionally, we could also use some more regularization on the Models to help train the model better \u2014 some techniques could involve Label smoothing (to add a noise to target labels) \u2014 this would allow the model to generalize better and prevent over-fitting .
