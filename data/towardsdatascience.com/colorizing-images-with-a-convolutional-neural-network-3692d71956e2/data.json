They\u2019re works of art, with a skilled person painstakingly coloring in each part of a black and white photo, adding skin tones, backgrounds, and more. They\u2019ve been popular since the dawn of photography, and are still made today \u2014 the only difference is that the artist today uses Photoshop instead of a paintbrush.", "Hand-colored photos are beautiful, but making them is slow work. You have to make decisions about the colors to add in, have the painting skills to place them into the original photo, etc. Even with modern tools, hiring an artist to colorize a single historical photo costs between $300 and $500.", "Enter Convolutional Neural Networks. In many cases, the colors in an image are unique \u2014 the exact color of a person\u2019s clothing, the perfect shade of green for a tree, etc. are lost forever the second a black and white photo is taken. In other cases, though, colors are predictable \u2014 surprisingly so. Skies are usually blue (or could plausibly be blue), greenery is green, people\u2019s skin is skin colored, water is blueish, clothes usually aren\u2019t garish or crazy colors, etc.", "Because color is more predictable than you\u2019d think, it\u2019s almost more tractable using Machine Learning than you might initially think. This means you can actually use a Convolutional Neural Network to colorize historical black and white photos.", "Colorful Image Colorization is an algorithm which uses a CNN to analyze the colors across a set of color images, and their black and white versions. Training data is easy to obtain here \u2014 any color image can be changed to grayscale, and then paired with its color version to make an easy training example. The algorithm uses several feed-forward passes to ultimately take in a grayscale image, and in the words of the algorithm's creators, \u201challucinate\u201d a plausible (though not necessarily correct) set of colors to fill into the image.", "Colorful Image Colorization was trained on over 1 million images. Its creators report that when the results were shown to humans in a \u201ccolorization Turing test\u201d, people believed the colors were real 32% of the time. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but remember, this task was even harder than just plausibly colorizing a historical image. People in the Turing test didn\u2019t just believe the image they were seeing was a well-executed hand colorization \u2014 rather, they believed the image really was a color image. Doing this was a machine from a grayscale original \u2014 even 32% of the time \u2014 is quite an accomplishment.", "Some pretty remarkable emergent properties bubble up in the algorithm\u2019s results. Given a grayscale historical image with a Coca Cola logo, for example, it correctly colors the logo Coca Cola red \u2014 presumably from seeing thousands of training images with red Coca Cola logos. Importantly, the algorithm was never taught what a Coca Cola logo is \u2014 through the magic of CNNs, it figured this out from looking at lots of training data.", "When I first started testing Colorful Image Colorization on grayscale images, my first react was unease, bordering on disgust. As a professional photographer, color is hugely important, and a big part of my work is getting the colors in an image exactly right, choosing subjects based on their vibrant colors, etc. The idea that so much of color was pre-determined \u2014 enough so that a machine could guess at the colors in a scene and get it approximately right \u2014 was disturbing and a little depressing. Was color really an interesting element of a composition, or was it something that could be filled in later as an afterthought by a hallucinating computer program?", "This perspective certainly has plenty of historical precedent. Famed documentary photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson \u2014 best known for his photos of Gandhi and intimate street portraits of people around the world \u2014 summed it up quite succinctly to his contemporary William Eggleston: \u201cWilliam, color is bullshit.\u201d And Ansel Adams \u2014 perhaps the best known American photographer of the 20th century \u2014 was deeply skeptical of color throughout his career. It\u2019s deliciously ironic that the creators of Colorful Image Colorization chose to demonstrate their process by colorizing some of Adams\u2019 images in their first paper about the algorithm.", "So is all of color predetermined? Can we release a brilliant new compression algorithm, where cameras take their photos in grayscale, and a CNN like Colorful Image Colorization fills the colors in later in the cloud? Is historical black and white photography dead? Should we throw out Adams\u2019 glass plates and replace them with brilliantly colorful prints of his landscapes created by a machine?", "Not so fast. Like many systems built on Convolutional Neural Networks, Colorful Image Colorization produces some remarkable results, but it struggles with edge cases. And thankfully, the world of visual arts is full of edge cases.", "The images where Colorful Image Colorization does best are those with predictable compositions \u2014 a blue sky above, some scenery in the midground, perhaps a nice obvious tree for good measure, and some water in the foreground that it can make blue. Lots of vacation snapshots turn out great with the algorithm. In a sense, it does best on \u201caverage\u201d images \u2014 those whose compositions and colors don\u2019t deviate much from the average composition and average colors of the 1 million images on which it was trained.", "For images with different compositions, novel objects, and unconventional colors, though, the algorithm struggles. Cities, murals, colorful markets, images with lots of non-sky negative space \u2014 on these images, Colorful Image Colorization falls flat.", "In a sense, then, the algorithm is actually a pretty good indicator of the uniqueness of an image. If your image looks pretty good after colorization by the algorithm, it\u2019s probably a fairly \u201caverage\u201d image in terms of composition and color \u2014 it doesn\u2019t deviate much from the millions of images on which the system was trained. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the image is bad \u2014 plenty of compositionally average images are commercial gold mines or depict a significant person or place. Sometimes an average image is good, especially when you want your composition and color choices to get out of the way and not interfere with the image\u2019s documentary content.", "But if you create an image which \u201csurprises\u201d Colorful Image Colorization \u2014 yielding weird or inaccurate results \u2014 pat yourself on the back. You\u2019ve created something which deviates from the average enough to fool the algorithm. In short, you\u2019ve created something artistically unique.", "For me, this redeems the artistic process around color. If you want an image that follows visual norms, it\u2019s good to run it through Colorful Image Colorization and see that even a computer can guess at its colors. But it\u2019s also comforting to see that unique or visually different work can fool the algorithm \u2014 it\u2019s proof that not all of color is predetermined, and a human artist has the ability to be surprising.", "So beyond a neat Machine Learning party trick or a tool for validating your artistic choices, does Colorful Image Colorization have value?", "Absolutely. On certain historical photos \u2014 especially portraits \u2014 the algorithm yields results which are extremely believable, and lend a depth and vibrance to images which would otherwise be flatter and less alive. For many of these portraits, the photographer would likely have used color film had it been available, so colorizing the images really amounts to filling in details they probably would have included had they been able.", "And in some cases, the algorithm\u2019s hallucinations are art in and of themselves. Running classic images like Into the Jaws of Death (which shows American soldiers disembarking into a wall of gunfire during the D Day invasion in Normandy) yield haunting dreamscapes where the color builds upon and enhances the original composition.", "Despite its power, Colorful Image Colorization does have blind spots. While the colors it hallucinates are plausible, they\u2018re not always historically accurate \u2014 the Pan Am logo in the image at the top of this article looks great in red, for example, but it was actually blue.", "Also, likely as a result of being trained on lots of historical photos which had sepia tones rather than true color, it tends towards rendering historical photos in muted shades of yellow and tan. One interesting experiment would be to train the algorithm on a set of historical images which really were shot in color \u2014 like a large archive of Kodachrome slides \u2014 and then see how this new version does on colorizing historical images. A CNN which could fill in Kodachrome-like colors would be fantastic for working with historical images, and could yield some really engaging results on images shot today.", "Ultimately, Colorful Image Colorization is a compelling example of the interesting synergies that can happen when two very different fields \u2014 Machine Learning and the arts \u2014 come together. You wouldn\u2019t expect that a neural network for guessing colors could prompt existential questions about composition, subject choice, and the uniqueness of photographic works. Nor would you think that it could reignite a dialog with art history perspectives \u2014 like those of Cartier-Bresson and Adams \u2014 which are over half a century old. But look at the results of Colorful Image Colorization, and these questions come up.", "As Machine Learning impacts more industries, I hope that visual artists \u2014 and all artists, really \u2014 start to engage with the questions that these technologies raise, both about society and about the artistic process itself. Machine Learning needs the perspectives of artists, creatives, and other thinkers from across society if it\u2019s going to continue to grow. But at the same time, Machine Learning can give something back, showing new ways to look at artistic work or even new ways to create it. Systems like Colorful Image Colorization show that when it comes to Machine Learning and the arts, the dialog goes both ways.", "P.S.: First, you should get my posts in your inbox. Do that here!
