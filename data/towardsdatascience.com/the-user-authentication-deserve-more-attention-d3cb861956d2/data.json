I\u2019m myself, why I should prove it two times?", "Moreover, with the upcoming security threat, I\u2019m also curious about where I\u2019m typing my passwords\u2014security matters for me.", "I remember the first timid attempts at creating SSO (Single Sign-On) solutions in the 2000s. We had many handcrafted tools, using cookies, redirect, and other tricks for getting the job complete. Every company had to reinvent the wheel.", "This age ended when OAuth (and then OAuth2) become the standard and helps to create SSO scenarios and authentication sharing with ease.", "Well, this was a big step forward, but it is not the end. The Oauth2 protocol solves only one part of the problem: we still need to code for implementing the authentication system.", "Coding is wonderful but requires time and costs. We cannot reinvent the wheel each time. That\u2019s why I wrote an article about finding a standard solution for identity access management (IAM) \u2014 and you should read it!", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution. You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "I can understand if you are entering two different services, from two different providers, like Gmail and Outlook\u2026 you need to enter other credentials. That\u2019s the only option. But what if the tools come from the same company? Think about that as a customer, but also as an employer, fighting with the thousand of B2B tools you use every day. ERP, CRM, Time tracking, mail, and you need to enter different credentials.", "I\u2019m tired. This is the most common feeling of a typical user.", "In most companies is still usual to have multiple vertical application, each one of them lives in its own scope. Somebody call them Silos. Where are fighting for destroing silos isolation using data integration, but we still have to enter our password twice.", "And passwords may be different from system to system, with different policies. So you can have the old ERP where you had the same password from 1985, or the new CRM that asks you to change the password every week, forbidding to use any memorizable word and asking to use numbers, mixed uppercase-lowercase characters, and maybe also an emoticon inside.", "I\u2019m sure you hate this situation like me, so you will feel a little bit better reading this article to the end.", "You will find a practical solution to all these problems and to the other issues not related to user experience (yes, the pain of the user is just the tip of the iceberg).", "Identity and access management (IAM) is a platform where you can implement authentication processes and policies. This piece of technology lets you manage all the users in a single place and saves IT managers sleep.", "The IAM is the architectural component that allows allocation to know who is who.", "In the figure below, you can see that IAM act as a central access point that interacts with users database, implements security standard.", "Thinking about authentication, the primary pain I have is about the user experience. Insert the passwords many times sucks. We already told that. But this is the less important point, thinking as an IT manager.", "We need to expand our pain points to all the fields of IT: governance, maintenance, but with a particular focus on security.", "So, the central area of improvement are:", "In simple words an IAM is a software that centralizes all the authorization issues in only one place, solving them all.", "The good news is that the market gives us a lot of software solutions that already implement the best security standard and all common features. Moreover, they integrate out of the box with the existing tools used by the enterprises. Let\u2019s see in the next paragraph how this is possible.", "Many people in business thought that tools like this are suitable only for startups or small companies.", "They fear the cost of changing the status quo of the company, maybe touching legacy systems. Basically, they ask \u201cWhy I should change something that works?\u201d I always fear this way of thinking because it prevents me from catching new opportunities, but I understand \u2014 but not approve \u2014 the fear of a change.", "What I want to tell the people who are scared by adding an IAM into the company infrastructure, is that there won't be any breaking change. It is a progressive enhancement of the infrastructure. A well done IAM project integrates with the existing tools and doesn\u2019t move users' databases if not needed.", "Your used data can be left where are, just exposing their usage to the new application.", "If I didn\u2019t already convince you, look at Active Directory. Well, it is an IAM, just activating the ADFS module.", "Each respectable IAM integrates with the most used user sources, like Active Directory, RDBMS databases, LDAP, and external API.", "The translation of this point in a non-technical idiom is that you can leave your users into Active Directory or the ERP. Still, you can enable other applications to use them in an SSO behaviour.", "This leads, progressively, to a unique user database where it is easy to implement security policies.", "Basing on your needs, you can choose an on-premise or online solution. The best online vertical application is Auth0. It comes out of the box with all the features you can desire and comes with a rich free tier that suits well in most of the small-medium use cases. Auth0 has a lot of examples of integration on the most common programming language and integrates with a lot of user sources (included Active Directory!). If you want to stay in the cloud, but you prefer to use a service from your public cloud vendor, each mega vendor like Microsoft, Google Cloud, IBM, or AWS Identity are right solutions. I tested many public vendor services, and they offer, more or less, the same features at a comparable price. Anyway, if you prefer to stay on-prem, Keycloak is the right tool for you. It is a free, opensource IAM Solution, and Red Hat supports it. Keycloak is as a pluggable opensource software, and you can extend it adapting to your need. Of course, with this solution, you will lose the cloud benefits, but with some PaaS solution or Cloud Kubernetes solution, you can reduce the maintenance costs and get the benefit of a hosted solution.", "With the emerging security issues and user expectations, we cannot entrust custom solutions. User identity is a too much important topic for failing. Moreover, it is the crucial point of the architecture and performance are in the first place. Using standard solutions, better if based on the cloud, helps to reduce the effort and ensure quality standards. The integration with IAM to the user database is usually painless, and you can integrate gradually with the existing application.", "Your home for data science.
