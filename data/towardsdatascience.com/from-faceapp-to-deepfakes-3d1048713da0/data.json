Both artists used self-portraiture to explore the performance of identity, often referencing other media. Sherman became known for her series Untitled Film Stills, in which she portrayed B-movie actresses. Morimura is known for recreating famous historical artworks, inserting himself as the subject. Both put in a lot of work to transform themselves, blurring the line between myth and reality.", "Now, thanks to developments in artificial intelligence (AI), anyone with a smartphone can shape-shift or insert themselves (or someone else) into another scene.", "When FaceApp went viral in 2017, it took me a while to finally try to see what the fuss was about. Swapping faces and seeing what I might look like in a few decades didn\u2019t do much for me. But then I dropped in Grant Wood\u2019s iconic painting American Gothic. I cannot tell you how much joy I got out of seeing that farmer grinning back at me.", "Mug Life is another app that leverages neural networks and deep learning. It ups the game by turning still images into 3D animations. I had much more fun with this one, though I never used it on a picture of myself.", "I did, however, drop some photos of myself into the Meitu app after having a conversation with someone about what we\u2019d look like as anime characters. This app made my stomach turn in a way the others didn\u2019t. The company promotes itself as \u201c a pioneer in mobile beauty experiences\u201d that uses \u201cpatented facial recognition and machine learning algorithms to map each user\u2019s unique facial features.\u201d Settings in the app make it clear what beauty means to Meitu: slimmer faces, bigger eyes, lighter skin free of freckles or birthmarks, and makeup.", "Meitu raises several issues. On a personal note, I was concerned that people who know me saw the picture above and said, with all seriousness, \u201cYou look really good in that photo!\u201d But there are also questions about data privacy. There\u2019s the whole skin-lightening issue. FaceApp\u2019s \u201chot\u201d filter did this too, though apparently as a defect rather than a feature. The chief executive apologized, saying \u201cIt is an unfortunate side-effect of the underlying neural network caused by the training set bias, not intended behaviour.\u201d Replicating bias within something like FaceApp may not have much impact on the world at large. But these same \u201cunfortunate side-effects\u201d come into play in other applications of AI, including lending decisions and predictive policing.", "Let\u2019s rein it back in here. The apps named so far are used primarily for entertainment, with people generating memes and selfies for social media. The images fill feeds alongside sponsored ads, brand ambassadors, and influencers. Influencers like Lil Miquela, a bot who has starred in ad campaigns, been featured on magazine covers, released singles on Spotify, and was recently hired as the Arts Editor for Dazed magazine.", "The rise of virtual influencers like Miquela brings possibilities that are exciting to some and terrifying to others. Companies can hire models who are easy to control to push their products. Quantum Capture CEO Morgan Young predicts celebrities may begin using CGI doubles: \u201cThere\u2019s a really interesting revenue model built around that, wherein you might not get access to the talent themselves, but you might get access to their digital avatar, and the actual human being will make money off of the use of their avatar.\u201d", "These avatars raise plenty of other issues, including questions about appropriation and who benefits (financially and otherwise). Regardless, we\u2019re facing a future where the lines between human and AI will only be increasingly blurred.", "The same technologies used to power apps like Mug Life and create avatars have already helped create such convincing facsimiles that people have not been able to distinguish what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not. Apparently, even Carrie Fisher thought her appearance in Rogue One was thanks to old footage rather than a CGI production.", "While great for the entertainment industry, Jordan Peele highlighted the potential dangers of \u201cdeepfakes\u201d in his video where former U.S. president Obama appears to call Donald Trump \u201ca total and complete dipshit.\u201d The video may have gone viral because many people found it funny, but the concern is real.", "Deepfakes have already been used to try to harass and humiliate women through fake porn videos. The term actually comes from the username of a Reddit user who was creating these videos by building generative adversarial networks (GANs) using TensorFlow. Now, intelligence officials are talking about the possibility of Vladimir Putin using fake videos to influence the 2020 presidential elections. More research is being done on deepfakes as a threat to democracy and national security, as well as how to detect them.", "On a personal level, I feel torn. I appreciate the possibilities that these technologies open up for performance and play. I\u2019m as interested in the algorithms as what they can produce. But I also worry about the wide-ranging implications of how they can be used, by whom, and with what (un)intended consequences.", "Thanks for reading!
