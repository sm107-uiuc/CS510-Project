When you\u2019re doing data work just for yourself, think about why you\u2019re doing it and what will change depending on what you see. If you have a clear answer, you\u2019ll also see the decisions. If you\u2019re truly not making decisions, then the data science subfield you want is analytics, not statistics. Analytics may use hypothesis testing equations, but does not actually test hypotheses.

Let\u2019s drill down into two main things that people incorrectly(!) believed they got from those p-values. Firstly:", "vi) How much data did Bo use?", "It\u2019s a myth that p-values tell you about sample sizes. There are many paths to a low p-value, including convenient or obviously-violated assumptions. If the only thing you know about a test is its p-value, you know nothing about the test.", "If the only thing you know about a test is its p-value, you know nothing about the test.", "To make a point, I intentionally generated Option C and D\u2019s p-values in a perverse manner. I used only two datapoints to generate p-value = 0.0032 and then I added one more datapoint to get p-value = 0.1753. It\u2019s almost as if I anticipated that people would make this very common statistical thinking error. Yay, trick questions!", "Nope, low p-values don\u2019t mean lots of data.", "vii) What statistical conclusion can we make from the test?", "Folks, who is this \u201cwe\u201d you keep commenting about?", "One of recurring themes in the comments was allusion to a mythical \u201cwe\u201d learning something.

Bo is in charge here!", "Statistical hypothesis testing is a tool for making reasonable decisions under uncertainty. You pick the settings, you put in some data, and you get a suggested action. If someone else prefers to use different \u2014 yet also valid \u2014 assumptions or settings, they might get a different result. Both will be correct.", "\u201cWe\u201d should think before we try to foist our opinions on those who don\u2019t want them.", "The only entity potentially learning something is the decision-maker(s), yet many of the comments seemed not to realize this.

It\u2019s impractical, inefficient, and impinges unnecessarily on freedom. \u201cWe\u201d are not going to choose the flavor of my next espresso treat.", "Since we know that Bo\u2019s hypothesis test is valid for decision-making, here are some additional items that must be true:", "5. The hypotheses were set up in the right order, starting with the default action.", "(See my article Never start with a hypothesis for details.)", "6. The significance level was set in stone BEFORE any data or p-values were examined.", "No self-respecting decision theorist would condone a decision approach that is wide open to confirmation bias, so the test must have been performed in a correct manner from that perspective as well.", "If you allow yourself to move the goalposts after the ball has landed, you\u2019re doing it wrong. The significance level must be set in advance!", "If you allow yourself to move the goalposts after the ball has landed, you\u2019re doing it wrong. This means that whatever the significance level was, Bo committed to it early in the project.", "7. A significance level of 0.05 is the default for teaching, so it\u2019s often the default setting in statistical software.", "Teachers often prefer to sweep distracting details under the rug in order to focus on the new concepts they\u2019re trying to introduce. Defaults are handy for reducing cognitive burden, so students are asked to assume significance level = 0.05 unless told otherwise. One day I might write about the fascinating and arbitrary history of why it\u2019s 5% and not some other number (the story involves a famous man with a big beard, an ambitious textbook, copyright law, and agriculture).", "8. The beauty of the classical hypothesis testing framework is the way it lets you control your decision quality and risk of making mistakes.", "What most people don\u2019t realize is that statistical hypothesis testing is a personalized decision-making framework that gives you three dials. You set any two of them, the third clicks into place automatically, then you put in data and get a suggested action as output. Here are the three dials:", "All of these things are in balance. Lower significance and higher power refer to better control over Type I and Type II errors respectively. (I\u2019ve defined all these jargon terms for you in my article \u201cStatistics for people in a hurry.\u201d) You can ask for a procedure that makes both of these errors very unlikely\u2026 but at a price: lots more data. The required sample size budget dial may set itself on an exorbitant number. Too expensive? Increase your significance level or decrease your power requirements.", "If you\u2019ve come to the land of p-values and confidence intervals, you\u2019d better be here for a certain way of controlling quality and risk.", "Your ability to pick the quality of your decision-making is pretty much *the* point of classical statistical inference. The reason you\u2019re not choosing a Bayesian approach (which doesn\u2019t use p-values, significance, or confidence intervals) is that you want to control the risk of being wrong. If you don\u2019t care about this, go Bayesian.", "Now let me tell you what I see when I look at what most people do with classical statistical inference.", "I see a powerful framework with three dials. One (sample size) is often set with a shrug, meaning you end up in one of two bad extremes: overpaying for data or wasting your whole project. One is usually ignored (power) and one (significance level) is set to 0.05 because that\u2019s what people remember from school. I can\u2019t facepalm hard enough. Talk about missing the whole point!", "I can\u2019t facepalm hard enough. Talk about missing the whole point!", "To use the framework correctly, the decision-maker(s) should thoughtfully the significance level every time.", "How should they set it? If people show enough interest, I\u2019ll write a separate article about that. In the meantime, it\u2019s vital that you understand that whoever is responsible for making the decision should pick the decisions settings.", "Whatever you choose\u2026 choose it thoughtfully.", "When I\u2019ve been in charge, I\u2019ve used significance levels above 0.1753 and below 0.0032. I\u2019ve used 0.05 and 0.08 too\u2026 and a whole bunch of others. It always depended on what was at stake and what quality the decision needed to be made at.", "The significance level is allowed to be whatever the decision-maker is comfortable with.", "Comments were wrong in two ways when they said that Bo would reject / not reject the null hypothesis with those Option D & C p-values \u201calmost surely.\u201d Firstly, you don\u2019t know anything about the decision or the quality the decision-maker intends to make it at, so don\u2019t be too sure of that. Secondly, \u201calmost surely\u201d is a technical term from measure theory which you\u2019ve almost surely used incorrectly, probably because you didn\u2019t know that your stats profs were making a private joke during lectures. A better way to say what you meant would be that a decision-maker using \u201cconventional\u201d settings would make certain conclusions, which brings me to\u2026", "viii) Does Bo give a damn about convention?", "This one is thorny. If Bo is making a decision with *full* authority, then no; Bo shouldn\u2019t give a damn about convention and should use decision tools however Bo sees fit. There\u2019s always more than one reasonable way to approach decision-making. However, since you don\u2019t know whether Bo is the decision-maker, you can\u2019t really make assumptions here. When decision-making custodians act on behalf of society (as in the case of a government\u2019s approval process for new medication), then tradition dictates much of their decision criteria and they do have to follow convention because they can\u2019t ask society to participate directly each time. If the decision-makers are fully involved in the decision, then following convention is usually a sign of laziness. (Admittedly, sometimes laziness is efficient.)", "When you see Option B (significance level = 0.05), you don\u2019t know whether the decision-maker(s) chose it thoughtfully, whether they picked it because it\u2019s what all the lemmings pick, or whether someone didn\u2019t bother to adjust the software settings. That\u2019s less info than Option A, which at least tells you that the significance level for testing was almost surely set on purpose.", "A lot of comments led themselves astray on the topic of convention. Following convention is only wise under certain circumstances.", "If you\u2019re doing something naughty with a hypothesis test, you\u2019re not testing a hypothesis correctly.", "Option A (significance level = 0.08) would tell you that the decision setup is unconventional, but it\u2019s ignorant to assume that an unconventional choice is sneaky in some way. (In fact, those of you who thought it meant Bo was up to no good (e.g. \u201calpha-hacking\u201d) missed all the implications of the word \u201ccorrectly\u201d and clue #6 above. If you\u2019re doing something naughty with a hypothesis test, you\u2019re not testing a hypothesis correctly.)", "In fact, an unconventional choice like 0.08 is more likely to signal that Bo is an expert who understands the tradeoffs between data budget, power, and significance. But we don\u2019t know that for sure.", "Here\u2019s what each of the options in the trick question actually told us:", "A) The significance level was set on purpose. Someone had to have thought at least a little bit about it before choosing it, since it\u2019s different from the default setting.B) The significance level happens to be the same as the teaching and software default setting. It may or may not have been set to 5% thoughtfully.C) Not much.D) Not much.", "Which is why the winner is Option A.", "A small postscript for those whose thinking went down the \u201ceffect sizes\u201d track:", "9. \u201cTesting a hypothesis\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cusing hypothesis testing math for EDA\u201d so effect sizes shouldn\u2019t come into the discussion.", "The appropriate effect size for taking action should already have been incorporated into the way Bo phrased the null hypothesis.", "If you know everything about the decision-maker\u2019s decision setup and assumptions (you don\u2019t!), you can infer something about how unlikely the null hypothesis world is to generate data at least as extreme as what Bo observed.", "If you know the significance level and the p-value together (you don\u2019t!), you can infer whether the decision-maker found the data surprising enough to change their mind and switch away from their default action.", "When you find out that someone else\u2019s p-value is \u201clow enough\u201d, all you really learn is \u201cthe decision-maker was surprised by something.\u201d", "If you don\u2019t have information about the test\u2019s hypotheses and assumptions, one p-value is as useless as another.", "Unfortunately, you don\u2019t know what \u201clow enough\u201d is, so you don\u2019t even know if Bo was surprised into action. Without all those other bits of information, one p-value is as useless as another. Both C & D were intentional red herrings, intended as a wake-up call to those who make the mistake of taking p-values at face value. (For an explanation, see my article Why are p-values like needles?)", "The best thing about statistical hypothesis testing is that it gives you a way to control your Type I and Type II error probabilities, balancing them against your data budget. (See my article Statistics for People in a Hurry if you need a refresher.)", "If you don\u2019t bother to thoughtfully set your tolerance for the risk of making the worst kind of mistake available in this framework \u2014 the Type I error \u2014 then you\u2019ve missed the key part of the whole exercise.
