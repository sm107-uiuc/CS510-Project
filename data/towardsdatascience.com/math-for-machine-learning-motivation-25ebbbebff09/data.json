I hope you are staying safe and sane during this pandemic (amongst other unprecedented situations happening all over the world right now). This is going to be my very first post on Medium, so I\u2019ll keep it light (i.e. no real in-depth technical discussion or Math problems) and short.", "A little bit about me: I\u2019m a 2nd year MS in CS student at Columbia University, focusing on Applied ML/NLP. I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia and I was previously an ML Engineer at Bukalapak Indonesia, working mostly on NLP projects to enhance its Search and Question Answering systems.", "Here is a funny (in my opinion) meme to start off:", "As titled, this post will talk about the importance of understanding the math behind this somewhat overhyped field so that you don\u2019t become the one that jumps over important fundamentals like the kid above. This post is geared towards people who are fairly new to the field, e.g. just shifting from other fields, so that you (hopefully) are motivated to dig into the math for ML by the time you finish reading this post. I won\u2019t quote any reference for this post, it\u2019s all going to be my own opinions (which I hope you will somewhat agree with), based on personal experiences.", "If you come from one or more of these backgrounds (Comp Sci, Math, Stat, Operation Research) or if you\u2019re working on ML, you must realize that working on ML is becoming fairly easy nowadays. A lot of tools, each serves its own specific purpose, are readily available (Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch to name a few). Few lines of code will give you the ability to create some fancy stuff (predictive model, chatbot, object detector, etc.). More tools are coming and do it make us even less motivated to dive into the math?", "The answer is YES and NO (I like to give fuzzy answers for your reference).", "The answer is YES if you\u2019re a passive user and you want to stay passive. By being a passive user, I mean you use the packages without trying to understand the math, or at least the logic, behind those magic packages. This basically applies to almost every field in Computer Science, in fact, even to Engineering in general. One funny example I could think of is why Indonesia imports so many useful goods while having the raw material. We never learn, do we?", "Back to the topic, the answer is NO if you belong to one of these tribes:", "I think this is the big question, but believe me, the answer is fairly simple. Although the proper answer should be something more thorough, I would like to mention only these two for simplicity:", "This is, I guess, what most of you would expect. Of course, you have to master all those distribution stuff (random variable, expectation, plug-in principle, MLE, bias, etc.), including the legendary Bayesian inference (prior distribution, posterior distribution, Bayes estimate, conjugate prior, etc.). However, I want to emphasize that some of you (in regards to your career goal) might not need to actually study this topic in-depth, high-level understanding should suffice. The people I know that need to have a decent understanding of this topic are those who work as a (proper) Data Scientist or as a Quant Engineer.", "Data Scientist, of course, needs to know ProbStat in-depth as they, day to day, define the right metric for the problem, design and execute experiments/simulations (this includes defining the right sample) and ultimately define which action to take based on the result of some testing scheme, e.g. A/B testing. Quant Engineers, for those of you who are not familiar with, are those who develop and implement complex mathematical models that financial firms use to make decisions about risk management, investment, and pricing. In Indonesia, this kind of job might not be as popular. But, I believe there are actually some of them, although they might go under different names. In fact, I think actuarial jobs could be classified as Quant jobs. I have an acquaintance who is an actuary and he just simply masters this field of math. Every time I have a question/problem set regarding ProbStat, he could always solve it in minutes, which I find very amusing.", "This is, I guess, what fewer of you would expect. But, believe me, if you come from a Comp Sci background like me (and not Math), you will probably fancy this topic more than ProbStat. I\u2019ll touch that in a bit.", "Since this topic is very broad, I guess you are questioning which LinAlg & Calc exactly is relevant for ML. Hence, below I present you with some of the most important topics that you need to comprehend (or at least know about it in a nutshell), sorted from what I reckon the most important:", "If the above topics don\u2019t sound familiar to you, it\u2019s perfectly fine. When I was first starting my journey at Columbia, I struggled a lot to meet the prerequisites for the Machine Learning course (COMS W 4771). The Prof was Daniel Hsu, which was an amazing lecturer and theoretical ML researcher, go look him up (https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/daniel-j-hsu)! It probably took me around a month to really be comfortable following the lecture as I needed to catch up with the prerequisites while concurrently being in the course.", "That being said, the above topics play very important roles in how you see Machine Learning. Machine Learning is often said to be \u201cglorified Statistics\u201d. Not that I disagree, in fact, I somewhat agree. But, I feel like LinAlg & Calc are less emphasized for ML compared to ProbStat. I would even argue that LinAlg & Calc contribute more to the advancement of Machine Learning (or Deep Learning specifically) nowadays. An example would be the Optimization Algorithm which leads to the resurgence of Deep Learning. Optimization Algorithm (such as SGD) makes computation far lighter while still trying to be accurate up until a certain degree (i.e. trying to get the best local minimum if you recall the concept). Thus, I prefer to say that Machine Learning is \u201cglorified Maths\u201d if that makes any sense to you.", "In relation to practical works, I also want to point out that LinAlg & Calc is miles more important, particularly to make computation as efficient as possible while preserving correctness to some degree. Let\u2019s not talk about ML and instead talk about mere matrix multiplication. Noobs like me would certainly do it in cubic time. For folks who are familiar with algorithms, they might know and implement some more efficient methods such as the Strassen algorithm which does it a little bit faster than cubic time (n to the power of 2.8 to be exact, n being the size of the input).", "From that simple example, I believe you could follow where I\u2019m heading. There are just so many problems regarding numerical computations out there. Part (or most I should say) of them is solved by Numpy, a Python package built to optimize numerical operations. Numpy is then used by the bigger guys like Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. This is just mere numerical computation which is probably on the lowest level of the Machine Learning hierarchy (this, I made up myself, so please don\u2019t quote me on this one). Problems such as :", "are on the higher hierarchy (again, I just made this up). There are just so many things to look into and the solution usually goes around LinAlg & Calc.", "If you aspire to become a (proper) ML Engineer, which I also aspire to be, where you build an efficient ML-related code for your products (either by carefully choosing the right package and algorithm or even when you go hardcore and write the algorithm from scratch, yikes), then you should consider learning about LinAlg & Calc topics that I mention above. I guess an intermediate level of understanding should suffice, measured by these factors (again, I made this up):", "If you have a lot of free time and want to dive even deeper until you have an advanced level of understanding, you should go for it. At that level, you should be able to write proofs or derive solutions by hand for convoluted problems (e.g. proving that a certain Optimization Algorithm could give a solution for a particular problem within a certain number of steps with an error no more than a certain epsilon). But, that is on a-whole-nother level and I don\u2019t see myself to be able to be somewhere near that in the near future. Usually, folks who have a PhD in Machine Learning or relevant fields (Maths, Stats, Physics) are the ones you could always rely on to do jobs on that level.", "I hope the explanation above is clear and easy to follow for folks who have Comp Sci and/or Math background. My apologies for folks outside those backgrounds because I need to use many technical terms, otherwise I think the depth of this article would be too shallow.", "I think that would be all for now. Over the course of this last 3\u20134 months of 2020, I hope I could create more posts, preferably some more technical ones, should I have the time and resources to do so. Kindly let me know in the comment section below what topics would you like to see regarding Math for Machine Learning!", "I imagine I could even go to talk about some ML problem sets from the coursework I\u2019ve taken at Columbia, which should be interesting to share for you who are interested to see the examples of math often involved in ML (and how rigorous they are for f***\u2019s sake) or for those of you who are planning to take some graduate-level courses around ML in the future. In the meantime, stay safe, and do care for others!", "Your home for data science.
