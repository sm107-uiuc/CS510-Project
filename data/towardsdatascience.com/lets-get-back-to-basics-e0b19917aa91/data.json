Sure, every company is \u2014 in a way. But another trend has followed on the heels of that one, and this one is even more broadly applicable: Every company is becoming a data company. Heck, every organization is becoming a data organization! The benefits to becoming data driven are clear; obviously, if you can make decisions based on data, and measure the impact of those decisions, it\u2019s a much more effective and efficient approach than the guesswork or gut-feeling that used to drive so much of business. So it\u2019s no surprise that there is a strong trend in the market to become data driven, in part because cloud technologies and the growing usage of SaaS make data more accessible than ever.", "But not so fast. I\u2019m also seeing that while there\u2019s more appetite than ever to be data-driven, it\u2019s harder than ever to be good at it. In fact, I\u2019d say there\u2019s actually an opposite trend around the fundamentals of data (accuracy, quality, reliability, governance, access, protection, security) \u2014 these are all extremely challenging to get right, and getting worse to manage.", "But here\u2019s the kicker: Not only do these trends exist simultaneously, they actually reenforce each other. Meaning, the more you try to become data-driven (trend up), the harder it is to get the fundamentals right (trend down). And the less reliable the data is, the less seriously organizations take their data efforts\u2026 and the negative cycle continues.", "What can we do about this? To start, I think it\u2019s helpful to think about how we got here. There are a number of reasons for this inverse relationship between data appetite and data success. For one, data has been layered on as the superficial icing on the cake \u2014 not the cake itself \u2014 with a focus on artificial intelligence, dashboards and the UI side of data instead of reimagining the structure to begin with. In addition, and perhaps relatedly, data tends to be a fragmented objective across the organization.", "It\u2019ll take changing both those realities to ensure that we aren\u2019t cannibalizing our own efforts by working with unreliable data. In many ways, it amounts to getting back to basics with a mindset shift:", "Why is it that our standard for reliability is so high for everything we do in business \u2014 it\u2019s part of what encourages this data driven trend in the first place! \u2014 but somehow we\u2019ve come to accept the fact that our data is unreliable? I continue to be perplexed by this every day. If you\u2019re feeling the same \u2014 what have you seen that helps organizations turn the tide on this paradox?", "Your home for data science.
