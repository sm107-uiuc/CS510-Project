Ordinarily to develop a machine learning model, and to deploy that model to a state where it can be operationally used, requires deep knowledge of programming and a good understanding of the algorithms behind it.", "This limits the use of machine learning to a small group of people and also, therefore, limits the number of problems that can be solved.", "Fortunately, over the last couple of years, a number of libraries and tools have sprung up that reduce the amount of code needed for model development or in some cases eliminate it completely. This has opened up the potential for non-data scientists such as analysts to leverage the power of machine learning and additionally allows data scientists to prototype models faster.", "Here are some of my favourite low code tools for machine learning.", "PyCaret is a Python wrapper around popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and XGBoost. It enables a model to be developed to a deployable state with just a few lines of code.", "Pycaret can be installed via pip. For more detailed installation instructions see the PyCaret documentation.", "PyCaret has a repository of public datasets which can be installed directly using the pycaret.datasets module. The full list can be found here but for the purposes of this tutorial, we will use a really simple dataset to solve a classification task called the \u201cwine\u201d dataset.", "The PyCaret library contains a suite of modules to solve all common machine learning problems which include:", "To create a classification model we need to use the pycaret.classification module. Creating a model is extremely simple. We simply call the create_model() function which takes a Model ID as a parameter. A full list of supported models and their corresponding ID\u2019s can be found here. Or you can run the following code after importing the appropriate module to view the list of available models.", "Prior to calling create_model() you first need to call the setup() function to specificy the appropriate parameters for your machine learning experiment. Here you can specify such things as the size of the test train split and whether to implement cross-validation as part of the experiment.", "The create_model() function will automatically infer data types and handle those using a default method. When you run create_model() you will receive the following output that shows the inferred data types.", "PyCaret will use a default set of preprocessing techniques to handle things like categorical variables and impute missing values. However, if you need a more bespoke solution for your data you can specify these as a parameter in the model setup. In the below example I have changed the numeric_imputation parameter to use median.", "Once you are happy with the parameters the model is using you hit enter and the model will finalise and display a grid of performance results.", "PyCaret additionally has a plot_model() function which displays a graphical representation of the model performance.", "This tutorial has just shown the basics of model training with the PyCaret library. There are many more functions and modules that deliver a full low-code machine learning solution including feature engineering, model tuning, persistence and deployment.", "In 2018 Google released a new tool called BigQuery ML. BigQuery is Google\u2019s cloud data warehouse solution and is designed to give data analysts and scientists fast access to large quantities of data. BigQuery ML is a tool that enables machine learning models to be developed directly from the BigQuery data warehouse using only SQL.", "Since it\u2019s release BigQueryML has evolved to include support for most common machine learning tasks including classification, regression and clustering. You can even import your own Tensforflow models for use within the tool.", "From my own experience, BigQueryML is an extremely useful tool for speeding up model prototyping and is also viable to use as a production-based system to solve simple problems.", "To give a brief introduction to the tool I will use a data set known as the adult\u2019s income data set to illustrate how to build and evaluate a logistic regression classification model in BigQueryML.", "The dataset can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and I am downloading as a CSV file using the following Python code.", "Here is a script to download the data and export as a CSV file.", "If you don\u2019t already have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account you can create one here. When you initially sign up you will get $300 free credit which is more than enough to try out the following examples.", "Once on GCP navigate to the BigQuery web UI from the drop-down menu. If this is your first time using GCP you will need to create a project and get set up with BigQuery. The Google quickstart guide gives a good overview here.", "The CSV file that I downloaded earlier can be directly uploaded into GCP to create a table.", "You can inspect the data in the table by clicking on the table name in the sidebar and selecting preview. This is what the adults\u2019 data looks like now it is in BigQuery.", "To train a model on this data we simply write a SQL query which selects everything (*) from the table, renames the target variable (income) to label and adds the logic to create a logistic regression model named \u2018adults_log_reg\u2019.", "For all the model options see the documentation here.", "If we click on the model which will now appear in the sidebar alongside your data table you can see an evaluation of the training performance.", "Now we can use the model to make predictions using the ML.PREDICT function.", "Popular deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow notoriously have a steep learning curve and it can be difficult for a beginner or non-data scientist to get up and running with it. The fastai library provides a high level API that allows you to train a neural network in just a few simple lines of code.", "Fastai works with Pytorch so you need to install both libraries before you can use it.", "The fastai library has modules for working with both structured data and unstructured data such as text or images. For this tutorial we will use the fastai.tabular.all module to solve the classification task for the wine data set we used earlier.", "Similarly to PyCaret fastai will perform preprocessing for non-numeric data types via an embedding layer. To prepare the data we use the TabularDataLoaders helper function. Here we specificy the name of the dataframe, the data types of the columns and the preprocessing steps we want the model to perform.", "To train the neural network we simply use the tabular_learner() function as shown below.", "The performance metrics are displayed after running this code.", "To use the model to make predictions you can simply use learn.predict(df.iloc[0]) .", "The explore the fastai library further see the documentation here.", "I send out a monthly newsletter if you would like to join please sign up via this link.
