The language is incredibly flexible in the first place\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The Julia programming language is a young, up-and-coming language that takes brilliant approaches to solving problems with modern programming. The language is incredibly flexible in the first place, and the addition of a very strong methodology behind all of the standard software that comes with the language out of the box makes it an even smoother language to do. This idea can be felt in a lot of ways, such as Julia\u2019s preemptive approach to virtual environments and dependencies, which makes managing dependencies in the language for your projects an absolute breeze, regardless of the size of your team.", "A rather new and cutting-edge feature that is still in beta from Julia computing is the new Julia Hub website. If you\u2019d like to take a look at the site in its current state, you can check it out here:", "Whenever a Julia package is registered, the pull requests to add the package to the Julia General registry is completely automated and done by the Registrator.jl bot, which is already very convenient. Whenever packages are added to the Julia General registry, they are also added to the lump of data that is accessible by from the JuliaHub website.", "Sometimes it can be hard to find great packages to do a specific job. JuliaHub blows this old-fashioned problem out of the water with its own package browser that allows one to browse packages by name, discipline, or capabilities. This allows for the easy discovering of new and exciting technology, and keeps lifelong learners on their toes waiting for the next awesome library they might run into.", "Furthermore, from the package\u2019s page, you can find out a lot more about it! For instance, you could read descriptions, visit the Github page, and even view the documentation. Taking things a step further, you can take an overview of all of the dependencies for a specific project, contributors, the README.md, and even the other packages that depend on it. Just take a look at the Lathe.jl page on JuliaHub:", "Needless to say, this is pretty awesome! Being able to access all of this information in one place is pretty convenient. As a programmer, the only other thing that you might want is the documentation for the package you are viewing.", "In the past, I have talked about Documenter.jl, which is a Julia package that extracts the doc-strings from your code and puts it into beautiful HTML5 templates that are deploy-able, searchable, and completely automated to create. If you would like to learn more about Documenter.jl and how to use it, you can check out that article, here:", "This automated documentation takes an entirely new and brilliant approach on the JuliaHub website. That\u2019s right, the Documenter web-based documentation is automatically generated, and even better \u2014 hosted by JuliaHub for free. This is a revolutionary idea to create consistent, automated and easy documentation for every library in one language all available easily in one single place. No more Googling to find the documentation that you need, now you can find it all in one place in the same exact format!", "JuliaHub is an interesting and gravitating approach to solving many of the problems that documentation and package information have in the modern day. Although JuliaHub might be in beta, and relatively immature, it is clear that it is shaping up to be a great tool for developers and aspiring software-engineers alike. Not only that, but it is certainly making it a lot easier to approach new pieces of software by comfortably putting the information on each package conveniently in one place.", "Since I started using JuliaHub, I have also found myself picking up packages at a rapid pace. A simple and inclusive environment like the one at JuliaHub with a slough of packages with all the details at your fingertips provides a nearly perfect environment to facilitate exploration and learning \u2014 which is something that I appreciate, being a big fan of knowledge \u2014 especially when it comes to computers and furthermore; Julia.", "Your home for data science.
