To continue to challenge myself, I\u2019ve decided to put the results of my efforts before the eyes of the data science community.", "This is the third and final post:", "Part 1: (which can be found here) explore and cleanse a dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithmsPart 2: (which can be found here) apply various Product Recommendation models with the recommenderlab R packagePart 3: implement the best performing model in a Shiny Web Application", "In the course of the research I carried out for this project I came across several pieces of work, all of which provided great inspiration and insight for my Shiny Application. A special mention goes to Jekaterina Novikova, PhD for her Movie Recommender System , and Prof. Michael Hahsler, who created a Joke Recommender. They used the MovieLens and the Jester dataset respectively, which come as default with recommenderlab.", "However, both authors employed recommenderlab as the engine for their Shiny App, which famously requires a long time to calculate predictions on large datasets. The solution adopted by Jekaterina to make calculations more manageable was to take a sample of the dataset to reduce the size of the rating matrix. However, this may prove detrimental to prediction accuracy.", "Fortunately, I came across this brilliant Kaggle kernel by Philipp Spachtholz, who not only carried out a salient analysis on a non-Kaggle dataset but, crucially for me, also build a Shiny-based Book Recommender system using a much faster collaborative filtering code.", "Philipp drew his inspiration from this blog-post by SmartCat Consulting, which describes how to use an Improved Collaborative Filtering code and all the associated functions contained in the companion Github repository. In particular, the repository includes the simililarity_measures.R functions for calculating similarity matrices, and the cf_algorithm.R file with the collaborative filtering algorithm and prediction function.", "In this final part of the project, I will describe how I used these functions in my Shiny implementation.", "In this section I am using the retail dataset from Part 2 to prepare the data files needed for the Shiny App. Note that in Part 2 I have carried out the extra formatting step of removing those orders that contained the same item more than once.", "For the app deployment I need to create 2 data files: past_orders_matrix and item_list.", "past_orders_matrix is a user-item sparse matrix containing the history of past orders. This is needed in the Shiny server.R file for all the calculations.", "I save the file for use in the app.", "item_list is a list of all the products available to purchase. This will feed in the Shiny ui.R file to make the products list available for selection.", "I save the list for use in the app.", "To show how the Improved Collaborative Filtering works, I am fitting the best performing model found in Part 2, the item-based CF, on the same made-up order. I am also doing the same using recommenderlab to compare the performance of the two approaches.", "First, I re-create the made-up order using the same 6 randomly selected products.", "Next, I to put new_order in a user_item matrix format.", "Then, I add the new_order to the past_orders_matrix as its first entry.", "Now, I need to set a number of parameters required by the Improved CF to work.", "I load the algorithm implementations and similarity calculations.", "And finally I can fit the item-based CF model with the Improved CF and check the runtime.", "Let\u2019s now run the item-based CF model with recommenderlab and compare performances.", "The speed gain is around 20 times and is consistent with what Philipp Spachtholz witnessed in his work. This is rather promising for the Shiny App!", "For the App deployment I went for a Proof of Concept approach. My focus has been on speed of execution and on getting right all the calculations shown in this article to power the server side of the App. This reflects on what is currently a minimalist User Interface, which simply features product selection and a Complete Your Purchase action button.", "Here\u2019s a link to the Product Recommender for your peruse.", "I will continue to work on the User Interface to add features that improve customer experience and make it more of a final product.", "Here are a few ideas I\u2019m toying with at the moment:", "I have genuinely enjoyed working on this Market Basket Analysis project. Recommendation systems are a fascinating field of research with real-world applications and I feel that I\u2019ve just scratched the surface on this subject.", "I have also really appreciated learning the ropes of Shiny App development, which turned out to be more straightforward that I initially thought: reactivity is a key concept to get your head around and it forces you to think in terms of User Interface and Server being two sides of the same coin.", "The main consideration for me is that the potential is massive: even small companies with an online presence can benefit from implementing the most basic of recommendation system. With only a few lines of code one can improve customer experience, promote customer loyalty and boost sales.", "The full R code can be found on my GitHub profile", "Your home for data science.
