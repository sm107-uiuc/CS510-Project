Would we be able to apply one of the main AI Algorithms to our Brain? Yup, you read it right!", "What controls each of our thoughts, behaviors or arguments?", "Indeed, neurons. Infinite neural circuits that work perfectly. But how do these neurons behave and conform so as not to make a mistake? Imagine that you are running, the first time you will fall, but little by little you will be taking faster steps until you achieve your first race.", "So who do we blame for falling in the beginning? That neuron! or maybe that one? How is the brain capable of learning through our mistakes?", "Dr. Geoffrey Hilton, the godfather of Deep Learning, among other great privileged minds, argued that behind this mechanism is a Deep Learning core algorithm that operates in the same way inside the brain.", "If you want to learn more, go visit oscargarciaramos.com", "In case you have never heard of this concept before. At a very high level, this concept is based on the idea of \u200b\u200blearning from mistakes and get better at doing a specific thing. It would be a way of \u201cblaming\u201d the neuron connections in our network for their errors in order to progressively improve the desired output.", "Although this statement has not yet been verified and even rejected by some neuroscientists as \u201cbiologically impossible\u201d, the fact that Deep learning techniques and neuroscience are increasingly intertwined, evokes many \u201cghosts from the past\u201d. But also, new challenges in understanding our brain.", "AI, for its part, will surprisingly become a way of understanding the mystery of how we learn as humans.", "The dogma of learning according to neuroscience is based on \u201cfire together, wire together\u201d. What does it mean? When we want to learn to do a new thing, the neurons connect to each other through synapses creating a network, which is refined slowly and will allow us to learn to do a new task, like running.", "A neural network is made up of different individuals, or neurons, that only interact with their neighbors. In other words, a single neuron only receives information from its upstream partner, and delegates or transmits that information to its downstream ones. What does the strength or resistance of these connections depend on? On the \u201csynaptic weights\u201d. A simile would be a strong or weak handshake. As you know, depending on the person to whom you shake hands, not always a strong handshake is the most ideal. The main point of learning is based on \u201cadjusting\u201d or balancing the weights of all our handshakes so we get our desired result.", "Now, imagine that all the neurons and their neighbors decide to vote for the \u201cmayor\u201d of the community. However, his opponent comes out. Who voted badly and how can the network solve it as a whole? We have to \u201cblame\u201d someone so we drive the result towards something better. That\u2019s our \u201clearning process\u201d. But to learn, we will have to \u201cadjust\u201d the weights and even before we have to know which connections to adjust first.", "Back in 1986, Hilton, David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams discovered that information travels through different neural layers and if we observe how far the obtained output is from the one expected, it is possible to mathematically compute an error signal. This signal can be transmitted through the neural layers, each receiving a new signal error based on its upper layers.", "Imagine a soccer match. There\u2019re four players in the small area and the last one fails and does not score. What will the coach do?. He will start from the last player who touched the ball and will judge \u201chow guilty\u201d he/she was not to finally score and will go backwards judging who needs an adjustment \u201cin his boots\u201d, that is, he will change their \u201csynaptic weight\u201d.", "The players return to the area, that is, we compute the same problem again, and \u2026 Goooaaaal! We made it! The backprop adjustments have taken effect, the network will take as reference the new synaptic weights and will continue learning.", "Backprop in combination with other algorithms have become the dominant technique in areas such as facial recognition, automatic text transcription or even AI gaming victories like Go or Poker.", "However, and for now at least, the idea of \u200b\u200bbackprop-like signals in the brain remains conjecture.", "One of the strongest reasons is that AI networks are not, in general, configured like biological ones and, therefore, we cannot extrapolate the backprop to them.", "Basically, our brain is not able to go back and change the synaptic weights. The biological neurons do not work like this. They can change their connections through more inputs or other types of regulation like hormones or chemical transmitters, but it was considered \u201cimpossible\u201d to use the same physical branches and synapses for direct and feedback signals without confusing biologial neurons.", "But, if we get to apply the theory to our brain we could develop a new layer that links biological learning to Artificial Intelligence.", "Did you find this article useful?", "Feel free to leave a comment or share this post.
