They also come up in job interviews and academic exams.", "A biased predictor is eccentric, i.e. its predictions are consistently off. No matter how well it\u2019s trained, it just doesn\u2019t get it. Generally, such a predictor is too simple for the problem at hand. It under-fits the data, no matter how rich.", "A high-variance predictor is, in a sense, the opposite. It often arises when one tries to fix bias and over-compensates. One\u2019s gone from a model that is too simple \u2014 i.e., biased \u2014 to one that is too complex \u2014 i.e. has high variance. It over-fits the data.", "Somewhere between these two is the \u201csweet spot\u201d \u2014 the best predictor. Often this is not easy to find. A data scientist can help. That\u2019s another story \u2026", "The input is a temperature in (say) Fahrenheit. We want it classified comfortable or not. The training set may capture the judgments of a single person or a group.", "As noted elsewhere, this problem is not linearly separable. Simply put, the correct solution should behave as", "It\u2019s clear we need two thresholds, one to distinguish too low from just right, one to distinguish just rightfrom too high.", "What if we are limited to use only one? Such as when our classifier is only capable of learning linear decision boundaries. No training set \u2014 no matter how rich \u2014 will help. We just can\u2019t get the middle predicted comfortable and the two extremes predicted uncomfortable.", "What if we had domain knowledge. That is, we knew the characteristics of the problem. Here that it needs two thresholds. We could work out a good solution.", "We\u2019ll suppose we don\u2019t have such domain knowledge. Said another way, we want a generic solution.", "We\u2019ll consider a single nearest neighbors approach because it can learn nonlinear decision boundaries and is simple to describe. We\u2019ll describe it specialized to our problem. For two reasons: (i) further clarity and (ii) convenient for discussing its variance.", "Now suppose the algorithm is trained on the following data set. Each temperature was labeled \u2014 C or U \u2014 by 10 people.", "This algorithm would label 45 as C, 50 and 55 as U, and 60 as C. This doesn\u2019t seem right. 50 and 55 are deemed uncomfortable. We expect 45 should also be.", "What is going on here? We have only 10 labelers. It\u2019s plausible that \u201chalf of them labeling 45 as C\u201d is noise. With many more labelings, this fraction might well drop to below 0.5.", "Another way to look at this is that the model\u2019s predictions have high variance. Think this way. Imagine a different set of 10 people labeling the data. Train on this new set. The prediction at 45 is unlikely to be off. This would be too much of a coincidence. That said, there very well could be some temperature on which the prediction is off.", "So, as we\u2019ve seen in our example, a high variance predictor is susceptible to learning the noise in the training set. Noise doesn\u2019t repeat itself. Next time we train it, it will learn noise on a different input. From the point of view of a user, who only uses it as a black-box predictor, the predictions aren\u2019t consistent across training runs.", "So how do we fix this algorithmically . That is, without asking for additional labeling (which incurs a cost). We smooth the data, either during pre-processing, or as part of the algorithm. Below we opt for the latter. We replace single nearest neighbor by three. For simplicity, ignoring computational efficiency considerations, we describe it in the form below:", "We have a more robust classifier. Each prediction will be based on a labeled sample of size 30 \u2014 three times more than we had from our single nearest neighbor classifier. Compared to the single threshold classifier, this one is less biased. It is inherently still capable of learning non-linear decision boundaries.", "Of course, precisely how accurate this new classifier is compared to the previous two is an empirical question. This involves a precise comparison of the combined effects of bias and variance of each classifier. In short, it needs a suitable train-test empirical evaluation. That\u2019s another story.", "Your home for data science.
