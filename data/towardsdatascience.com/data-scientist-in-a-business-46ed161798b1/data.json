Also, in pursuit of being precise in the world that isn\u2019t, there are attempts to clearly define data analyst, statistician, data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, developer, data architect or other related roles, and even to stratify into different levels within them. Then there is a discussion around the importance of data science focused educational degrees (or advanced STEM degrees in general), the number of which appears to be growing quickly. Hence, it gets confusing rather fast.", "Are we trying to be precise in the world that is not?", "While the diverse perspectives are extremely important for learning more about the profession, as well as for identifying potential areas of improvement, here is why I think the definitional efforts themselves are a Sisyphean task:", "So where do we go from here? Let\u2019s look at this classic diagram:", "How many people do you know who possess in-depth expertise across all three major areas? Imagine working in the business \u2014 Sales, Operations, Client Service, Executive Management, Marketing etc. \u2014 for several (or many?) years and then (or before, or at the same time) gaining equivalent expertise in Math and Computer Science. No wonder that the genuine representatives of the subset called \u201cData Science\u201d are often compared to a unicorn, the frequency of which is possibly not unlike that of unicorns in the startup scene. You can get a more detailed overview of the data science skills in this article. While this data science triumvirate of expertise is aspirational yet hard to nail down (how do you know when you are an expert across the three?), this may help explain why data science often works best as a team sport\u2026 I mean, science (in the companies that can afford an entire team).", "OK, so is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Yes, a pragmatic one.", "Instead of a precise definition of what makes a data science practitioner in a business, I believe a better way is to consider three fundamental pillars:", "Often, business understanding and experience is overlooked, simply assumed or just briefly mentioned in advice on becoming a data scientist, yet it is a big part of what makes an effective practitioner. Data science for business exists to solve real problems where data is integral to the discovery and/or solutions. There are three aspects to this expertise:", "This is a tough ask of anyone \u2014 and especially when working in large firms with hierarchical or specialized structures. While the business ABCs can be quickly learned on the job and in school, the deeper intuition comes with experience. There are many benefits to such learning, from not having the executives waste time explaining the basics to the ability to identify and organize relevant data, spot and solve problems that business truly cares about, and convert what may be technical language into the business speak. In addition, the business perspective helps with prioritization, where sometimes getting to the 90% of the result with 10% of the effort may be sufficient before moving on to the next project. There is more discussion about this in The Third Wave Data Scientist article.", "\u201c\u2026I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but as a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise.\u201d", "Jake VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook", "However, without the next \u2014 technical \u2014 pillar, business will fail to appreciate what can and cannot be accomplished with data science, what value can be extracted, and how to move towards (almost) objective, anecdote-neutralizing, and data-driven reality.", "This pillar is about being able to implement data-enabled solutions needed by the business, one of the early major examples being observed in Moneyball. Chances are, if you search online along the lines of \u201chow to become a data scientist\u201d or \u201cwhat is a data scientist\u201d, you will mostly get articles focused on the technical side of the role. And there appears to be an immense spectrum to learn.", "To help sort things out, I would split the technical side into two perspectives: an underfit (core, will apply to most if not all of data science jobs in businesses, but may not address all of the specific company\u2019s needs, especially if the company is advanced in data science applications) and an overfit one (adapted to the specific firm\u2019s needs and the data science team setup, hence hard to predict prior to being employed at the firm).", "Here is what I believe the \u201cunderfit\u201d perspective contains:", "One might say that despite being \u201cunderfit\u201d this still seems like a lot. I agree \u2014 data science is an interdisciplinary and rather complex field \u2014 but I think this knowledge is very achievable. The training resources are plentiful and often affordable, especially at the beginner to intermediate levels \u2014 one only needs time and desire to study and practice. In addition, the peer support (e.g. Stackoverflow and Stackexchange) and specialized websites (links to a few of them are in this article) allow getting answers to a variety of questions that may have been too specific to be covered in whatever training one may have undertaken. I believe that despite being \u201cunderfit\u201d, the technical know-how coupled with the business expertise is an outstanding background for any data scientist.", "OK, so what goes under the \u201coverfit\u201d perspective? The answer is \u2014 everything else (probability weighted) that could be linked to the broadest data science understanding, and that\u2019s where I think a lot of variability in data scientist definitions sets in. For example, one may or may not need to:", "Over time, some of the above may no longer be a \u201cmaybe\u201d. Needless to say, learning and continuously practicing all of them (and more) in addition to the business and technical fundamentals is hardly realistic for a single person despite being aspirational. Having personal interest in some of the areas or anticipating demand from one\u2019s business could be a good way to start chipping away at this broad spectrum of knowledge. In some ways, working in data science is akin to being in a graduate school: you know there is always something more to learn, you feel like you are always behind, but time is limited hence you have to pick your battles and just deal with it.", "However, despite the time and effort required to advance this skill set, it is important to not lose sight of the first \u2014 Business \u2014 pillar. Otherwise, there is a risk of the team being perceived as a niche data-cruncher that always needs to be told what to do and what business problems to solve.", "You can be a successful business person and have a solid technical background, but there are some personality traits that glue it all together and are likely to further amplify your success as a data scientist:", "In conclusion, while it is hard to singularly define a data scientist role or path for the reasons mentioned above, the focus on the business and \u201cunderfit\u201d technical background could be a great foundation for any career in the field \u2014 recognizing that whether it is viewed as sufficient by different firms will vary.", "Last but not least, considering that data science is evolving so rapidly and undergoing somewhat of a paradigm shift, I would highly recommend reading Thomas Kuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific Revolutions. This is a book that never gets old.", "Your home for data science.
