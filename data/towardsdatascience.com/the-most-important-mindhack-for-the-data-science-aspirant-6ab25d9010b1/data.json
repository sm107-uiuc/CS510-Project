It\u2019s simple, but works. You are amazed by how much you have learnt while working on it. Now, you wish to share your work to the rest of the world. So, you begin writing a blog. Soon, you realise that your project is not decorated enough to be \u201cblog-worthy\u201d.", "You could have always written a \u201cHow to do X\u201d or a \u201cBuild X with Y\u201d article. But, you prefer to not add onto the redundancy of certain content on the internet. You think about posting your project on LinkedIn. After all, its the network that could help you increase your professional contacts.", "Then you think of the projects you have seen on your LinkedIn feed over the past few days. Each being scarier than its predecessor. Once again you realise that your project is not ready to go onto a platform, especially one with so many complex projects ruling the likes and shares.", "At this point, some of you might save your code files into Github, with or without documentation. If you prefer to keep the code files in your local system, I pray you don\u2019t delete them by mistake during a routine desktop cleanup. I was stupid enough to do it.", "After a few weeks, you forget all about the project. Life moves on. You start learning new things. You build more projects, but do not discuss about your work with anybody. You are literally the Bruce Wayne of beginner data science projects. This is no doubt the road riddled with convenience. But convenience is a very poor catalyst to improvement.", "The less convenient pathway would be to discuss your work with others, communicate your efforts with them, help them understand your work, understand their feedback and improve upon what you already know.", "If you would be taking away only one statement from this article, I want it to be this \u2014 \u201cIn order to improve as a student of the data world, realise that everybody around you is an able mentor\u201d.", "When you are a beginner, each project serves you the ability to learn something new. Hence, these projects deserve your care and undivided attention. The more you understand what you have done and why you have done it, the easier it is to explain to another.", "Data science is largely about generating value for your stakeholders. It is not what you make. It is what value you provide people with.", "If you have spent at least a few hours on your project, it goes without saying that you will need to spend more on it to refine it. If it is something you have been working on for the college assignments, it should not be done for only the evaluations. You could, if you didn\u2019t prefer learning from it.", "A couple of ways to do justice to the work you put in are to", "In a world where online courses alone will not help, projects are the most important components of the beginner\u2019s toolkit. However if not utilised well, even the best tools can fail.", "Data science is largely about generating value for your stakeholders. It is not what you make. It is what value you provide people with.", "Most of us have grown up with the adage, \u201cSharing is caring\u201d. I still remember how I used to use that as a phrase to eat from my classmates\u2019 lunchboxes! However, as a data science beginner it is important to share your work as it provides an opportunity to discuss. A discussion can lead to you seeing the project from angles that you never had before.", "Yet, the thought of sharing eludes the beginner. As beginners, we all feel that we are too new to share our project. A few of the very common questions that arise in our minds are", "Firstly, how will you know whether your project is good until someone gives you their feedback? It is definitely important to be self-reliant and self-evaluate. But, in the data world you build things to help people. So, in order to understand whether you have hit the mark or not, you need to talk to people.", "And why would people \u201crip you apart\u201d? And even if they do, why should it bother a beginner who has nothing to lose? Every step we take is a new learning chance. If fear starts to govern the rate of our improvement, mastery is a far cry away.", "Finally, if your pet project is sensitive and you don\u2019t want it to be \u201cpublic\u201d yet, that is all right. But, if there is the slightest possibility to discuss about it with people you trust, you must do it. A fresh perspective is always going to help.", "Okay, so how do we share? Do we put a link to our work on a portfolio? Or tweet about the project? Or send the link to a friend and ask for a review? In my honest opinion, there is no universal answer. However, I can provide you with a framework that I have found to be extremely useful when making your pet project \u201cpublic\u201d. I call it the \u201cEmbrace The Storm\u201d pyramid.", "The nomenclature stems from the understanding that asking for feedback on something always generates a storm of fear, doubt and hope inside our minds.", "There are essentially three levels of asking for feedback on your pet projects. As you ascend the pyramid, the amount of criticism you get increases. On descending it, the amount of honest positive reviews increase. All the levels are of equal importance. It completely depends on your project as to what level is needed for valuable feedback.", "The smallest group of the three. This includes your friends or professors who you converse with on a daily basis or atleast a couple of times in a week. These people know you and are aware of the work you have put into your project.", "Advantage : They give you the most honest positive reviews. For example, if they like what they see, they will whole-heartedly appreciate it. They are proud of your work and will not hold back praise where it is due.", "Disadvantage : They criticise the least. Most of them do not point out the negatives because they don\u2019t think that would sit well with you. However, if you tell them about how important criticism is for you, some of them might help you out with it.", "This includes the people who you would have come across a few times at the college or the workplace. You are not close with them, but you both do realise the importance either of you gives to your work. This can include mutual friends who you don\u2019t know much or professors in the department who have never taught you but have known you.", "Advantage : They lie in the middle of the pyramid and hence provide a reasonably good amount of critical feedback as well as praise for your efforts.", "Disadvantage : You do not know these people very well. So, it does become a bit difficult to trust their opinions. I once had someone tell me they \u201cloved\u201d my project. However, he had not even run my code yet. Oops.", "These people might not even know about your existence. It includes everybody in the whole wide world who you don\u2019t know. If specificity is what you demand of me, I would say professors who you have never met but work in your domain. Data scientists across the world. The data science community on social media. And the list goes on.", "Advantage : They give you the most critical feedback. And much of these are of great quality and can help you improve your work significantly. They do not hold back from showing you the areas of improvement.", "Disadvantage : They don\u2019t really have the time to laud you for your efforts because time is money. If they have time to respond, they will make sure it is worth it. Having said that, many of them might not respond as they are usually busy people and are under no obligation to respond to you.", "Now, you will not need to write a blog or a post on LinkedIn if you dwell in Level I. It could happen over lunch. Your peers need not understand data, all they need to understand is your idea and its importance. They need not even be coders. The discussion and the ideas you get will amaze you. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Try it out and feel it for yourself.", "An email or a routine chat/meet-over-coffee could help with Level II feedback. If its too formal for you, a 10\u201315 minute conversation could also provide some very important feedback.", "Emails still hold true for Level III. And if you are lucky enough to get a meeting with your idol, that sounds great! However, much of interaction on Level III is going to be through social media. So, here is where you might need a blog post or an article. Use it wisely and sparingly. You will definitely be judged by your content.", "The bottom line here is that \u201cYou do not need to think that a blog post or an article is the only way to let your project be known and get feedback\u201d. If you want to improve, even the people you see on a daily basis can be important teachers, even if they know little about data. After all, a key part of data science is communication.", "In order to improve as a student of the data world, realise that everybody around you is an able mentor.", "Your home for data science.
