The approach takes the predicted points for the upcoming game, probability that the player takes penalties, corners, or free kicks, a coefficient for the player\u2019s aerial threat from the past 4 seasons, the likelihood of their team scoring 2 or more goals, and blends all of those in a normalized way into a final captain_choice coefficient. The coefficient is then discounted by an opponent_resistance score, based on the player\u2019s next opponents adjusted FDR and normalized score for defensive strength this season. Example of what the Pandas DF looks like below:", "Based on that formula, here is the list of the Top15 recommended captains for this GW. Lots of good options there, so not an easy choice by all means. If you want to play it safe, seems like KDB, Kane, Fernandes, Son, Salah and Vardy are some of the obvious choices, with Chris Wood interestingly coming up as the top choice, so if you have him and you feel adventurous enough to make him captain, this could be a nice differential play.", "Given the rain of goals last gameweek, the Top100 players in the world had a very juicy week, with average score > 100, which happens very rarely historically, with the top player scoring a whooping 144pts!!!", "We used this data to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "These stats make sense as most of the top players are trying to capitalize on offensive midfielders and strikers with the 3\u20134\u20133 formation.", "We had all of our teams score above average, with the highest team getting 76pts. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t pick the best captain on our top team, where Werner underperformed expectations. Had we picked the obvious choice \u2014 Salah- we could have gotten 87pts.", "We also participate in the FanTeam version of the FPL, where we fortunately went with Salah as captain, and that paid off, giving two of our teams pretty solid scores.", "Since we added a lot of new stats to our Algorithm this year, this Blog will evolve to have more stats and graphs and less text over time. Let\u2019s start with the Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like West Ham, Arsenal, Southampton, Man Utd and Leeds have some tough games coming up, so our Algorithm might not be picking players from those teams. CHE, TOT, CRY, MCI, and WOL seem to have more easy schedules over the next three weeks.", "We will try to stack up on players from teams that have a higher than 50 % chance of winning such as TOT, CHE, LIV, LEI, MCI, and MUN. We should try not to have too many defensive players from ARS, SOU, WHU, FUL, NEW, EVE, or AVL.", "Teams with higher probability to draw, especially when the game is combined with high odds for Under 2.5, might be good for selecting defensive players because if the game ends 0:0, that will result in lots of bonus points. Combined with the Under/Over Graph below, we can identify the following games with higher probability of at least one clean sheet \u2014 WBA-BUR, CRY-BHA, and SHU-FUL.", "Inversely, we might want to have more attacking players from games with high odds for Over 2.5 such as MCI-ARS, EVE-LIV, CHE-SOU, LEI-AVL, and TOT-WHU. Again, the odds from last week played out pretty well as most games predicted had over 2.5 goals!", "These will be updated later in the week as referee assignments have not been announced yet.", "On top of the referee probability to give penalty, let\u2019s also look at what teams have been given the most penalties over the last 5 seasons, to see where we get the highest combined probabilities. From the graph below we can conclude that LEI, CRY, MCI, MUN, and TOT are most likely to get a penalty.", "To help your choice of set piece takers please see the list below which is more or less up-to-date with a couple of doubtful predictions:", "Before we run our final team selector, let\u2019s take into account the predicted starting 11 for each team.", "Pay attention to the doubtful player names on the right and also the the most recent injury news updates below:", "It\u2019s time for the crown jewel of this year\u2019s improved Algorithm \u2014 the predicted player stats. After we layer in all the FDR, bookie coefficient, ref starts, projected lineups and injuries, there are two major metrics that we take into consideration when tuning our Team Optimizer for the next n-gameweeks team selection \u2014 predicted total points and expected value (ROI). Below are the stats for each metric, also broken down by position.", "As you can see there is a large number of options we can choose from for each position, so we will be plugging a lot of the stats above into an Optimization Function in Python, which will output the team with the highest expected total points, given our budget constraints and other metrics that go into our decision making process. Some of the preliminary filters, applied before the Team Selector Code kicks in, include:", "Most used formation by Top100 players last week was 3\u20134\u20133, so we will present optimized team for that formation. As you can see below, the model first looks at parameters that tells it if it should optimize towards full squad of 15 players, or towards a specific formation with 11 key players and 4 cheap fillers. For the fillers, it first looks at preferred formation and uses that to decide how many fillers to get per position. The model then subtracts the total amount spent on the 4 fillers from our initial budget and spends the leftover budget on the key 11 players, given the optimization function and model constraints.", "Example1: Optimize towards max expected points", "Example2: Optimize towards max Expected Value (ROI)", "We will always use our top scoring team from last week, and try to do maximum of 1\u20132 transfers. This week, however, we decided to play our Wildcard, because of the international break and the possibility of lots of players coming back injured or with COVID-19. We also wanted to shift budgets away from expensive defenders, towards cheaper defenders and more expensive offensive players, given the absolute avalanche of goals and very few clean sheets that we\u2019re seeing this season. So, this is what our team currently looks like, but we will monitor the news closely and might make lots of last minute rotations based on injury updates coming out Thu-Fri.", "The way the season has been going, we recommend shifting away from expensive defenders and trying to just have three mid-range defenders and stack lots of chips in midfield and offense, since it has been raining goals so far this season, and there is no indication that things might be slowing down anytime soon.
