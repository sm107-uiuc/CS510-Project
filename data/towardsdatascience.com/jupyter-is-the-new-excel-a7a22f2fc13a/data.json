You are an expert in pivot tables, formulae, charts or even VBA and PowerQuery. You can crunch a solution quickly but before you know it, your spreadsheet expands in tens of tabs, thousands of rows and spaghetti VBA \u2014 so its readability and maintenance goes right out the window. And when you dare to press F9 to refresh the results, you can grab a cuppa and still wait a bit more (if your computer has not crashed in between)!", "\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Sounds familiar? You are probably nodding fervently.", "As useful as it can be, for delivering real insight from data, spreadsheets simply won\u2019t provide all of the answers you seek.

The former come up with trading ideas and the latter translate those ideas into executable code. When as a trader you are also a proficient coder, this segregation is no longer required, which gives you a competitive advantage: not only Banks look to optimise their costs and hence you can survive a redundancy, but also you can put your own trading models to action and use this time-advantage to your benefit. Being able to automate mundane tasks is so liberating and coding in fact is so creative!", "It is pretty much a generational thing too, as more junior traders come already equipped with coding skills from uni, so if you want to maintain your employability you need to get involved.", "\u2014 see what I\u2019ve done there? \ud83d\ude04", "So what is the solution to those traders and financial professionals who find Excel limiting (if not outdated)?", "Learn Python and use Jupyter Notebooks as a container!", "Python is reasonably easy to learn and very versatile and hence there is an increased uptake within the financial community.
