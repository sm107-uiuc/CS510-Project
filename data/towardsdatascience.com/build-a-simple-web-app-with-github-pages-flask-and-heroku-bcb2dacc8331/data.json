Whether I\u2019m working on complex projects at an enterprise scale or doing mundane chores at home, I find myself fantasizing about automated solutions that elegantly and efficiently manage my workflows. Since many of us are WFH due to COVID-19 proliferation, where professional and personal responsibilities collide to convolute our daily work, there is no better time than NOW to automate tasks and deploy those solutions to the web. Let\u2019s start with something simple!", "Like many of you stuck at home, I\u2019ve been desperately trying to keep up-to-date on all things COVID-19. A barrage of empirical news articles and creative coping mechanisms flies through my inbox and news feed. A common thread? Patience is running thin! Being quarantined with our loved ones (or worse, in solitary) exacerbates those little pet-peeves and grudges that we could normally shrug off. And something that rubs everyone in my household the wrong way is weekly meal prepping.", "For the sanity of everyone involved, I decided to democratize weekly meal prepping and simplify the process. Instead of spending WAY too much time on weekends traversing the internet, choosing recipes from any number of popular online repositories, arguing/bargaining with my lovely but picky family, comparing the ingredients/instructions to maximize time and dollars\u2026", "\u2026 we now simply aggregate our favorite recipes in an easy-to-use, responsive online application hosted by GitHub Pages and deployed via Flask and Heroku. It\u2019s super straightforward and can be creatively applied to any number of arduous tasks that you and your quarantine companions quarrel over. Take a look at the finished product:", "BeautifulSoup and Splinter make it easy for us to iterate through web pages and extract the data we need. Every website has a DOM, which is a tree whose structure is defined by the nesting of tags. Beautiful Soup looks through this tree and then converts it into a specialized object equipped with powerful methods for traversing and searching the HTML for attributes, text, etc. Splinter is an open source tool for testing web applications using Python. It lets you automate browser actions, such as visiting URLs and interacting with their items.", "Half Baked Harvest is one of my favorite places for healthy, delicious recipes. Take a peek at the code below for iterating through the website to extract relevant bits of data like ingredients, instructions, image and more!", "We can easily replicate this for other recipe websites by inspecting the HTML. For the application I built, I scraped recipes from several other recipe repositories to create a custom database of recipe data stored in JSON format.", "After scraping all this wonderful recipe data, we need some way to extract only the relevant information. We could use basic comparison operators to check for search terms in the text, but what\u2019s the fun in that? Plus, there are some serious limitations to simply checking if a recipe title contains \u201cchicken\u201d.", "Instead, we can build a search engine to return recipes ordered by relevance. Using a bit of math, we can utilize scikit-learn to cleanse, tokenize, and build a weighted matrix to relate an input search term to a string of text.", "There are many ways to use this powerful tool! We could get creative and return only the recipes where the cosine similarity exceeds a particular threshold. Depending on the size of our recipe database, we might want to return all relevant recipes as a parsed array and then iterate through using another search term. For this app, I simply return all recipes that have a search term similarity > 0 and let my random function select one.", "Even though we\u2019re able to use python to grab recipes and return relevant options based on a search term, this functionality is not yet consumable by my tech-illiterate family. I need to use a simple interface that requests a search term and displays the recipe image, ingredients and instructions. We\u2019ll pivot to HTML and JavaScript to do the heavy lifting.", "Disclaimer: I have a lot of respect for web developers! There are some really great open-source, front-end frameworks for building responsive websites that get you up and running fast. I prefer Bootstrap and D3 for efficient deployment.", "GitHub has an amazing website hosting service called GitHub Pages. You can check out my repository below that uses GitHub Pages for building HTML (with embedded styling) and JavaScript to display recipe data.", "What next? We have all this wonderful recipe data in JSON format, a search engine written in python to help us extract relevant options, and a simple website that\u2019s easy enough for my family to use. To get these components to interact with one another, we need to use an Application Programming Interface. A web API allows for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet.", "Let\u2019s welcome Flask to the party!!! Flask maps HTTP requests to Python functions, allowing us run specific code based on endpoints. When we connect to the Flask server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/, Flask checks if there is a match between the path provided and a defined function. We\u2019ll use Flask to process an input search query as a given endpoint to run the search engine functions we defined earlier.", "For example, we could make send\u2026", "\u2026 for flask to process \u201cchicken\u201d as a parameter for the return_relevant_recipes() function. Brilliant!", "Finally, we need to deploy the API to Heroku using Gunicorn so we don\u2019t need to rely on localhost resources for users to access the search engine functions. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages we used in this project. I really like this tutorial for quickly setting up the necessary requirements (Procfile, requirements.txt, git connection, etc.) we\u2019ll need to deploy to Heroku. Gunicorn is a high performance web server that can run Flask apps in a production environment.", "Once you deploy the API effectively, you\u2019ll update the JavaScript code to send a search term as an endpoint to https://reciperfect.herokuapp.com instead of your localhost. It\u2019s that simple.", "This article outlines the necessary components to automating arduous tasks with several popular open-source tools and frameworks. Get creative! Weekly meal prepping was a seriously prickly chore before my family converted to using my app, and we haven\u2019t looked back! When we get bored with the current recipes, all I need to do is scrape some more. You could use this outline to automate any number of mundane chores to make life in COVID-19 just a little bit easier.", "My public repo can be found here.
