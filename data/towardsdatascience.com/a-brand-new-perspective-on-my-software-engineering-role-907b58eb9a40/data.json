What a fantastic read. I had no idea a book about the least exciting part of my job could be so riveting. I gained an entirely new perspective on my career as a software engineer and IT in general.", "This book is essential to everyone in Information Technology regardless of your role. To create value at any level in the organizational hierarchy, it\u2019s important to understand why upper management is doing the things they are doing.", "This book gives you a holistic understanding of IT operations. It puts you in the mind of somebody responsible for making the decisions that will directly impact your day to day life no matter who you are.", "This article is from the perspective of somebody who has only been in the industry and apart of a large organization for a relatively short amount of time. \u201cFresh eyes\u201d if you will.", "They don\u2019t teach you any of this at school. Why? I have no idea. But the lessons you will find in this book will not only help you survive but thrive in the IT world.", "Gene Kim takes you on an emotional journey from feature discussion with the business to deploying code to production to the chaos that ensues when it all inevitably goes wrong. Complete with the blood, sweat, and tears that come from each of the different personalities and egos you encounter along the way.", "First, I\u2019ll give you a brief overview of the plot in case you are unfamiliar.", "Bill Palmer is a midrange IT manager at a large automotive parts company. He likes his team, his level of responsibility, the simple challenges of his day to day work, the work-life balance. He\u2019s happy.", "Suddenly, his boss and his boss\u2019s boss get fired as the company is starting to struggle. There is now a vacancy for the head of IT. The CEO comes to him, saying if he doesn\u2019t fill the role, not only the IT department, but the entire company could be in grave danger.", "Bill, a former US Marine, feels it his duty to save the company and reluctantly takes the job.", "He had no idea what he was about to step into as he is now forced to build the IT department from the ground up.", "Below are some of the lessons I learned throughout this book.", "When Bill is struggling to understand what is going wrong within his organization, he is taken under the wing of what appears, at first, to be an eccentric mad-man but ends up being a voice of reason (represented by a character named Eric). He explains that Bill doesn\u2019t truly understand what work is. Furthermore, Bill doesn\u2019t understand that there are four types of work. What are these four types of work?", "Business Projects: This is work that is revenue-generating or strategic to the company. As far as priorities are concerned, this sits at the top. The goal is to make the customer happy or grow the business, and that is what these projects aim to do.", "Internal Projects (IT Operation Work): Work to help deliver business projects more efficiently and make your team more productive. In other words, to increase the Business Project throughput.", "Changes: Changes, more specifically, scheduling changes and implementing changes, are a necessary part of stabilizing all aspects of your IT operations as well as moving your business forward. Depending on the change management system you have, this can either run smoothly or be an absolute nightmare and take valuable time away from your top resources.", "Unplanned (Firefighting): The most dangerous type of work. This work is what stops the other three types of work from getting done. When any resource spends time working on an issue (environment outage, database failure, firewall issues, etc.), this is less time they have to work on the company\u2019s top priorities. Too much of this, or not handling it correctly, can be disruptive to your business.", "Thinking about how this relates to me, I realized that every piece of \u201cwork\u201d I have ever done has fallen into one of these four categories.", "Recognizing this, it puts into perspective why I have spent so much time working on the things I have. As a relatively new member of the team, much of my time is spent dealing with unplanned work and changes.", "Why? So our top resources (most experienced developers, subject matter experts) can spend time working on the top priorities of the business \u2014 the projects that generate revenue. Our company is at a standstill when they are working on unplanned work.", "This sheds some light on why the food chain is structured the way it is. This serves as motivation for me to become one of the top performers. So I can spend less time working on the last two types of work (changes and unplanned work) and more time on moving the company forward with the first two types of work (business and internal projects).", "In any technology stack and application, there is going to be one person who houses the majority of the knowledge and experience. This person is represented by a character named Brent. When things start to head the wrong direction, who knows how to fix everything? Brent.", "This exemplifies the importance of documentation, knowledge transfers, and training the rest of the team. It also stresses how crucial it is that this resource is managed correctly. The more time Brent spends on fixing an outage in IST2 (or any arbitrary unplanned work), the less time can spend on developing the primary functionality for the Phoenix Project (the company\u2019s top priority). If the proper training is given to the rest of the team, they can take care of the outage, and Brent can continue to work on the tasks that will result in the company generating revenue.", "I feel the need for Brent every single day. Since I am inexperienced in the tech stack, there are so many questions I have for Brent.", "Brent is a precious resource to the company, but Brent can\u2019t do his job if he has a developer asking him a question every 30 seconds. Questions he has answered a thousand times already.", "How can I minimize the level of my dependency on Brent? I can start by writing down every single thing he tells me and store these answers in a repository somewhere in an easily accessible, centralized place.", "Documentation that the rest of the team has access to. This not only helps me in the future but helps other members of the team who will one day have the same questions I do.", "It\u2019s a little extra work for me right now to save a plethora of work in the future.", "After seeing a birds-eye view of how taking up Brent\u2019s time can bottleneck the rest of the operation, it almost feels selfish to not be more proactive in my communications with him.", "An important lesson in IT operations, but an even more important life lesson. The following quote is something that we should never forget as we are continually working to grow:", "\u201cRepetition creates habits and habits are what enable mastery. Whether you\u2019re talking about sports training, learning a musical instrument, or training in the Special Forces, nothing is more to mastery than practice and drills. Studies have shown that practicing five minutes daily is better than practicing once a week for three hours.\u201d", "If we want to teach or learn something or apply a new practice, it\u2019s about constant improvement. Consistency is the key to building anything. Gene Kim reinforces the point:", "It almost doesn\u2019t matter what you improve, as long as you are improving something. Why? if you are not improving, entropy guarantees you are actually getting worse.", "I loved this section on how, over time, we can implement change and grow. It left me feeling inspired and hopeful for the future.", "No matter what your job title is, the lessons you will learn from The Phoenix Project are paramount to your growth as an IT professional.", "Please leave a comment if you would like to discuss any further. This is a topic I would love to hear some feedback on, more specifically, how this book has helped you get to where you want to be in your career.", "Your home for data science.
