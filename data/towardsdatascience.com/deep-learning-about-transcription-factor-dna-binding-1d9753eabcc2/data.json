Every trait, characteristic, bad mutations passed down from your great great great grandfather but somehow skipped a couple of generations before you (yay for hereditary statistics).", "We don\u2019t even know what half of it means.", "(half is most likely an overestimate).", "It\u2019s like trying to learn a coding language that can code biological life. All you know is that the bits are the four base pairs: A, C, T, G.", "With so-called \u201cclassical data,\u201d we\u2019ve entered a stage of frenzied excitement trying to build machine learning models to draw patterns from it. Now, what if we used machines to try to make sense of genomic data?", "What if we tried to use machine learning to unlock the secrets of gene expression?", "Every action or characteristic we possess can be ultimately boiled down to a combination of certain genes turned on and off. Gene expression controls pretty much everything in our bodies. What functions our cells carry out. The color of your hair. It also determines when, how, or if you have a deadly disease. We could be able to hack our selves. Eradicate disease. Boost our health. Alter our features.", "If gene expression were a film then transcription factors (TF), a type of protein, would be the director. What genes turn on and off is determined by transcription factors binding to regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers etc.) \u2014 and this differs across cell-types.", "Let\u2019s break this down even further.", "Transcription factors direct transcription \u2014 the copying of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. Think of the messenger RNA as a mailman. It delivers information (genetic code) from the DNA to the ribosomes to be translated into proteins.", "Therefore TFs control which information is copied and turned into proteins \u2014 affecting what functions a cell carries out or characteristics it possesses.", "Okay, cool. But there are literally tons and tons of different variants out there. How do we know if a TF will bind to a certain DNA sequence? or if another TF will bind to the same DNA sequence? Or how well the TF will bind to that sequence?", "Wait\u2026 aren\u2019t there also like hundreds of different TFs too? How in the world are we supposed to predict that? Guess and check?", "But don\u2019t worry, we aren\u2019t going to be doing the guessing and checking from now on\u2026 we\u2019ll get machine learning to do it for us \ud83d\ude09", "Based on past deep learning attempts to predict TF-DNA interaction, such as DeepSEA, I wanted to see if I could build my own algorithm that could predict how likely a given transcription factor will bind to a certain DNA sequence. However, I wanted to take this a step further and quantify this value.", "How do you quantify transcription-factor binding to DNA? \u201cVery well\u201d or \u201cnot very much\u201d are probably not the best labels.", "And ChIP-seq comes to the rescue!", "ChIP-seq stands for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays combined with next-generation sequencing. If you have no idea what this means, here\u2019s a refresher.", "Basically, ChIP sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful method for identifying genome-wide DNA binding sites for transcription factors and other proteins. It tells us where on the DNA the TF will bind to.", "Now, the peak regions are the black/colored parts on the graph that essentially mean there is a lot of gene expression in that specific area. Each peak has a signal value (the number of sequence reads that come from that genomic location).", "The signal value quantifies how well the TF will bind to the DNA.", "If we compare ChIP-seq peak regions of diseased and non-diseased cells, we can determine the genetic variants that cause or contribute to that disease!", "Another way we can use it is to determine how gene expressions change from cell type to cell type \u2014 this could give us a huge insight into how we can differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells!", "What if we could predict, given a specific genetic sequence, the signal value for a specific transcription factor?", "Input: raw DNA sequence (with no prior knowledge on variants)", "The machine is going to learn this through deep learning.", "So today, we\u2019re going to be applying a convolutional neural network algorithm. You\u2019ve seen them excel at image classification, but now see them excel at genomic data analysis. If images are just a matrix of numbers technically genomic data is just a matrix of A, T, C, and Gs. And they\u2019re excellent at pattern recognition.", "First, raw DNA sequences are inputted into the model. Each input sequence is converted into a one-hot matrix with 4 rows and 300 columns. The 4 rows represent the four base pairs (A, C, T, G) while the sequences are 300 b.p. (nucleotides) long.", "Because DNA is a double helix, and TFs can recognize either strand of DNA at a given location, the model is fed both the forward sequence and the reverse complementary sequence.", "Again, because the TFs can recognize either strand of DNA at a given location, convolutional layers for both sequences share the same set of filters. Using the architecture proposed by DeFine, the architecture looks something like this:", "Now let's go back to how we preprocessed the data. (I know, everyone\u2019s favOURIte part about machine learning).", "The awesome ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project compiled an opensource database of many cell lines with all kinds of sequencing.", "They have a couple of cell lines that have ChIP-seq and whole genome sequencing. I will be using the K562 cell line (with 79 transcription factors). The whole genome-sequencing comes from here. The reference genome is GRCh37. Note: the model must be trained separately on each transcription factor.", "To prepare the data for training, the peak regions (signal values) of each transcription factor were extracted from peak calling results. So now we have the signal values of the TF for each region that shows gene activity.", "Finally, to help with data augmentation we do a final step:", "Lastly, the data was split 70% for training, 15% for validation and tuning the hyperparameters and 15% for testing.", "With this model, a simple percentage accuracy would not cut it. We\u2019re going to bring in some statistical correlation measurements!", "This model will be evaluated based on both the Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman correlation coefficient. They both measure how two numbers are associated with each other. The higher the correlation = the stronger the relationship between the two! Here\u2019s a link for a quick recap of the two terms.", "The code behind this project will be posted on my GitHub soon, stay tuned!", "If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at the following:", "[1] M.
