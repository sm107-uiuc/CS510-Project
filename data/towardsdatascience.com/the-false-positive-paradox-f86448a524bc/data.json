About a year later, the same tragedy happened to her second child. A month later, Clark was arrested. The charge? Double murder.", "During the Clark trial, her defense lawyers argued that both children died of SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome. The exact cause of SIDS is still not known to this day, but it is associated with defects in the part of the infant\u2019s brain that controls breathing during sleep. Sleeping on the stomach or side, for instance, have been shown to increase the risk of SIDS.", "Now, what was the prosecution\u2019s strategy? There was no evidence whatsoever, nor were there any witnesses of the infant\u2019s deaths. The only evidence provided was a statistic. An expert hired by the prosecution, paediatrician Roy Meadow, estimated that the SIDS rate for a family like Clark\u2019s was around 1/8,500. The probability of Clark\u2019s innocence was, therefore, according to Meadow, the square of that number, or around 1/70,000,000. That number was apparently enough evidence for the jury, who found Clark guilty.", "There were a number of problems with the prosecutor\u2019s argument. First, even assuming that the real SIDS rate in a family like Clark\u2019s is as low as 1/8,500 (which is probably an underestimate), then the probability of 2 deaths in the same family is only the square of that number under the assumption that the two deaths are uncorrelated. But it is not clear if this assumption is true. If SIDS is caused by a certain gene, for instance, then both children will likely be affected by that gene. The prosecution failed to prove that assumption, and therefore the number of 1/70,000,000 cannot be taken at face value. The true probability is probably much higher.", "There is another, more severe, error in the prosecutor\u2019s argument, an error that is so common in the courtroom that it obtained its own name: the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy. Let\u2019s say we believe the assumption that the true probability of 2 SIDS deaths in a family like Clark\u2019s is 1/70,000,000. However, this number is not, as the prosecutors argued, the probability of Clark\u2019s innocence, given the two deaths. Instead, it is the probability of the evidence (the two deaths), given Clark\u2019s innocence, and this is a crucial distinction.", "If we want to compute the relevant statistic, the probability of Clark\u2019s innocence given the two deaths, here is one way to do it: take a base population of all families with two children who both died. For what fraction of that base population did the two children die of natural causes? That number turns out to be around 2/3. In other words, the probability that Clark is a murderer is only 33%, which tells a completely different story than the statistic quoted by the prosecution. As Geoffrey Wansell put it,", "\u201cWhat utter, felonious, irresponsible nonsense. This was one of the great miscarriages of justice in modern British legal history.\u201d", "After spending 3 years in prison, Clark\u2019s lawyers were able to win an appeal, but only because they discovered that the prosecution had withheld evidence pointing to the natural death of her second child. Clark, who had to deal not only with the loss of two children but also with a draining legal battle, developed serious psychiatric problems. She died in March 2007 in her own home from alcohol poisoning. A miscarriage of justice, indeed.", "In the OJ Simpson murder trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson was violent toward his wife. The defense argued that of all women that are subject to domestic violence, only 1/2,500 are murdered, and therefore the evidence that Simpson was violent toward his wife was irrelevant.", "This flawed argument is again the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy, but this time on the side of the defense. The relevant statistic is this: given that a woman was subject to domestic violence and was murdered, how likely was the murderer her domestic partner? That figure is a lot higher, approximately about 90%, according to author Gerd Gigerenzer. Professor Harry Crane from Rutgers University calculates an even higher probability of 97%.", "Nevertheless, OJ was found not guilty by the jury. Years later, he wrote the book If I Did It, in which he described how he would have committed the murder. To this day, it is not clear who murdered his wife.", "In The Drunkard\u2019s Walk, physicist Leonard Mlodinov tells the story of when a life insurance company denied to insure him after taking a blood test, which was part of the application process. Puzzled by the result, he took an HIV test on a hunch, which came back positive. His doctor told him that the chances were 999 out of 1,000 that we would be dead within a decade. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d, he added.", "However, as Mlodinow explains, his doctor had made a severe mistake. The probability of a false positive \u2014 a positive HIV test if the blood is not infected with the HIV virus \u2014 is around 1/1,000. But that number does not mean that Mlodinow is infected with a probability of 999/1,000, as the doctor concluded. In order to see what is going on, consider a sample size of 10,000 heterosexual, non-IV-drug-abusing white male Americans. Let\u2019s say that 1 in those 10,000 will truly be infected with the HIV virus. If all 10,000 take an HIV test, then that one person will test positive, but so will about 10 more people who are in fact not infected with the virus. Thus, the probability of being HIV positive, given a positive test result, is really 1/11, or around 9%. This is the number that his doctor should have reported. Needless to say, Mlodinow is well and alive today.", "In his book, Mlodinow also mentions the example of mammograms. Suppose that the false positive rate for mammograms \u2014 indicating breast cancer if there really is none \u2014 is 7%, and the true breast cancer rate is 0.8%. Then, doing the same math as above, the probability of having breast cancer given a positive test result is 80/780, or around 10%. However, as Mlodinow explains, when American physicians were asked this question as part of a research study, the vast majority of them estimated the probability to be around 75%.", "Or consider the problem of drug testing in athletes. In 1996, Mary Decker Slaney, a word-campion runner, was trying to make a comeback in the U.S. Olympic trial in Atlanta, when she tested positive for doping with testosterone, which effectively ended her career. However, the false-positive rate in such a test can be as high as 1%. Suppose that 10% of athletes are actually doping, and a test would catch 50% of abusers. Then, if 1,000 athletes get tested, around 50 dopers in that sample would get caught. But out of the non-dopers in the sample, around 9 would test positive as well! Then, the probability that the athlete is truly guilty is just 50/59 = 85%, or around the same probability of throwing six with a die. Mlodinow points out,", "\u201cThat certainly leaves room for reasonable doubt, and, more important, indicates that to perform mass testing (90,000 athletes have their urine tested annually) and make judgements based on such a procedure means to condemn a large number of innocent people.\u201d", "Clarks wrongful imprisonment, Mlodinov\u2019s positive HIV test and his doctor\u2019s reaction, and Slaney\u2019s ruined running career all show how easily and routinely people are misled by the wrong statistic. These are not isolated cases: in the aftermath of the Clark case, for instance, two other women convicted of murdering their children, Donna Anthony and Angela Cannings, were able to have their convictions overturned and were released from prison.", "The deeper problem here is a lack of statistical literacy in our society. Statistical literacy, the capability to make sense of statistics summarizing raw data, is a crucial skill not only in the courtroom or in the medical profession, but also in our daily lives. In 2010, the Royal Statistical Society launched a 10-year campaign to promote statistical literacy, the getstats program. The sad truth is that in a society that lacks statistical literacy, people can too easily get away with deceiving decision makers with misleading statistics. As John Pullinger, National Statistician for the U.K. puts it,", "\u201cIn the data rich world\u2026 those nations, governments, businesses and individuals who use the power of numbers will prosper. Those who \u2018get stats\u2019 will get on. Those who do not, will get left behind.\u201d", "If you liked this article, also check out these:", "Your home for data science.
