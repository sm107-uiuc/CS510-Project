As last year, I decided to thinking over what has happened and what can we expect, in my opinion, regarding Data Science for 2020.", "I\u2019ve never expected my last year\u2019s reflection post to have so many reads. From the feedback, people found it interesting and without further due, let\u2019s dive into this year\u2019s thoughts and keep the forum open!", "In 2019, we began to see machine learning solutions being applied to conservative (and much more regulated) fields, like healthcare \u2014 and, now, taken seriously!", "One of the most interesting Kaggle challenges I\u2019ve noticed this year was the identification of Pneumothorax disease in chest x-rays. In essence, a collapsed lung leading to severe breathing difficulties. It can be a very difficult and subtle condition to identify. This would be just another Kaggle challenge like any other, but now it included the participation of the actual institutions that study this condition. I\u2019m sure these machine learning algorithms could have been handy for me four years ago\u2026 A system like this was already approved by FDA.", "The main outcome of this step is not just to help affected individuals, but also, the remarkable participation of the higher hierarchy entities \u2014 the decision makers \u2014to enable the use of these kind of technologies in areas that were before very wary on embracing these technologies. As many data scientists know, this is usually one of the most difficult bottlenecks to overcome in new projects.", "Another example, not just from 2019, is the use of data science to identify drug-supplemental interactions (supp.ai). If you know combination, you can have an idea of the magnitude of what we\u2019re talking about.", "As users become more concerned about the handling and the ownership of their data, engineers and data scientists have to find ways to satisfy these new user requirements. Countless data breaches (you can take a look at this impressive 2019\u2019s summary) can be mitigated if companies do not actually own the user data for their business needs.", "Already introduced a couple of years ago, Federated Learning has become a hot topic regarding data privacy. In essence,", "Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model with training data distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. [Google AI]", "It might not be the silver bullet, but it may help software engineers and data scientists to architect systems following privacy by design. We can see this as an opportunity to use less data, while still being able to create products that are useful.", "Doing more with less (data). Kind of counter intuitive for DATA Science, right? Yes, it may be. But trust will be a key topic in 2020. How do you make sure users trust software companies with their data? For example, using Federated Learning to train prediction models for mobile keyboards without uploading sensitive typing data to servers (Hard, et al., 2018).", "If Federated Learning is a new concept for you, or you wish to understand it a little bit better, I totally recommend starting with this fantastic comic. You can even start creating your own first system with the open source framework Tensorflow Federated!", "One of the biggest headlines in November 2019 was related with Apple / Goldman Sachs credit card (most likely) gender discrimination. Users noticed that it seemed to offer smaller lines of credit to women than to men. Even if it all started with a viral tweet from David Heinemeier Hansson, it reminded us the same old problem of fully automated machine decisions: what were the main drivers that leaded to the final decision? Nobody explained so far, and it is difficult to get help from a human nowadays.", "As scary as it may seem, data scientists know that not including gender as an input of the model does not mean you cannot be accused of gender discrimination. Now read the official tweet from Goldman Sachs... With these kind of responses, you can see the current ingenuity persisting in some companies when using new pieces of technology. It is important to remember that,", "[This is the risk that] modern algorithms will result in \u201cproxy discrimination.\u201d Proxy discrimination is a particularly pernicious subset of disparate impact. Like all forms of disparate impact, it involves a facially-neutral practice that disproportionately harms members of a protected class. [Proxy Discrimination in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data]", "We should always keep in mind that sophisticated models trained on biased data can learn discriminatory patterns, which leads to skewed decisions. And these models can find proxies that lead to discrimination, even if you don\u2019t actually include the actual features you think may have historical biases.", "As a path forward, bias discrimination will continue to be one of the main topics, and unfortunately we\u2019ll see many more headlines like this, before companies take this issue seriously. Data scientists can help by performing exemplary exploratory data analysis, making sure the data is representative of the whole population, and exploring new architectures that can identify and mitigate these biases.", "When I switched to the data science field five years ago, the question \u2014 What programming language should I focus on [for data science]? \u2014 was a really difficult one to answer. As the years go by, with the massive growth of Python, it has become easier to answer. As stated in Stack Overflow\u2019s annual developer survey, released in April 2019:", "Python, the fastest-growing major programming language, has risen in the ranks of programming languages in our survey yet again, edging out Java this year and standing as the second most loved language (behind Rust).", "It is not just Stack Overflow, other websites also mention Python as one of the best bets you can do if you\u2019re planning to start programming, having a huge supporting community on your side, or making a quick prototype. And the last aspect is usually the most relevant for data scientists nowadays. It is difficult to have any other programming language helping data scientists more.", "Recall that Data Science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods (this gets back to 1996 with Hayashi!). I like to add to it \u201cas fast as possible\u201d. That\u2019s where Python fits in.", "I believe Python enabled the huge growth of Data Science (or is it the other way around?). If this is still a dubious decision for you, just go make some research to find out.", "Focus in 2020! As so many new articles get published everyday \u2014 by the end of 2018 it was already around ~100 ML papers per day were published on arXiv.org (yes, they are not peer reviewed, but even though\u2026) \u2014 focus must be something you add to your goals.", "As the idea of data scientist unicorn (fortunately) vanishes, the concept of specialization in data science has matured. Like the first split in a Decision Tree (sorry about that\u2026), you can go two ways:", "It does not mean the two paths never cross, but you should pursue one of them. If you want to enter into more detail, you can even find more specific job names as I mentioned last year.", "At the end of the day, what will be more important is to get things done! Remember you don\u2019t have to create things from scratch to make great things. Build on top of other great open source tools such as Tensorflow Extended or PyTorch. Both tools enable you to overcome many initial banging head on the wall moments.", "2019 was a crazy rollercoaster ride\u2026 Having joined Google NYC was one of the loops for me. Have a great 2020!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "SW Engineer & Data Science Manager @Google.
