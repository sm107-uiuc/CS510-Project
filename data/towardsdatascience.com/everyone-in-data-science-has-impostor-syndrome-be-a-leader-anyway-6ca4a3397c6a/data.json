Only compare the person you are today to the person you were the day before.\u201d\u2015 Unknown Author", "I was having a casual conversation with an former employee about her current position. In a round about way we ended up talking about leadership. What brought the common conversation to an almost cartoonist screeching double-take moment was when she told me that I was the best leader in our organization, she said there was some good ones, but I was the only \u201cgreat one\u201d she knew of.", "Two thoughts immediately came to me. First this was incredibly humbling and kind. And two, she is wrong \u2014 or at the very least, there is no way she is being honest.", "It\u2019s this second thought that often creeps up in the back of our heads. We\u2019ve given it a name \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d because it makes us feel as though we are only pretending to be what other expect of us, or see in us. We believe that at any moment we are going to be found out for the frauds we are.", "This article is not about the background of impostor syndrome, where it comes from, what causes it, how to cure it \u2014 because there are so many great articles written about that already.", "What I want to talk about is how we need to do our jobs as leaders without letting impostor syndrome sabotage us. Based on my experience, this doesn\u2019t have to be debilitating, and can actually be channeled positively.", "My experiences with it are much like other people\u2019s experiences. If I take some time to think about where I am, I feel often like I am going to be \u201cfound out\u201d at any moment and everyone will realize that I am not cut out for the job or position that I have. At certain times, I get into my own head and start to have doubts.", "This has been especially true recently as I found myself leading a data science team while I was simultaneously learning the basics of coding and machine learning. My own situation has been a great reminder though, as I see the self-doubt and irrational guilt of newer (and seasoned) many data scientists who are comparing themselves to mythical unicorns. Quietly lamenting that they don\u2019t know enough coding, or enough high-level statistics, or their data visualizations aren\u2019t all four-dimensional and interactive!", "\u201cWho am I to make these decisions?!\u201d \u201cWhat will happen to everyone who counts on me when I don\u2019t have the right answer, or more likely \u2014 when I give the wrong answer?\u201d or \u201cIt is only a mater of time before they realize their mistake in trusting me with this.\u201d", "As these doubts creep in, they cause anxiety and sometimes fear depending on the gravity of the situation. If you let this get to you it can cause havoc in your life and stifle your ability to be an effective leader.", "Why? Because if you give in to the fear of being inadequate, it can go one of two ways. The first response is that you become increasingly more concerned with your reputation, being \u201csmart enough\u201d, having the \u201cright answer\u201d, and needing to be consulted or in charge of making every decision.", "This can be poison to a team and an organization. My least favorite way that this manifests itself is what I refer to as \u201cinformation hoarding\u201d. In information hoarding, people see their power tied up into what they know or their control of important information in an organization. This can look like people not willing to share their code (or defensive about why they made certain decisions), in other areas they seemingly irrationally defend their analysis conclusions, without fully explaining their methodology.", "They end up trying to control who knows what, and it can be very detrimental. In a leader, they don\u2019t train or empower their employees because they are worried they will know more than them. As a colleague, they will be untrustworthy because they are not accurately informing you about their part of the organization.", "In both scenarios they are being more detrimental to the organization than their information adds value. Typically, they believe that the key to their usefulness and their reputation is tied to this information. This insight makes it clear what is really going on: self-doubt and insecurity.", "The second response is decidedly more positive. The same fear of the knowledge gap can lead you to identify areas you need to learn more about in your team. It can push you to spend more time talking to the team, asking deep questions about their work as you attempt to understand it more. Or you could seek outside learning which will inevitably bring outside perspective and value to the group.", "This response is borne from the same emotional impulses, but your decision to act on it differently is the key to channeling it into a positive direction.", "Another area of impostor syndrome is that you likely don\u2019t feel confident about making some of the decisions you need to make. Good. Once you are in a position of authority, you should feel the weight of certain decisions. You should second-guess your gut responses to them. This becomes more true the higher up in the chain you go, as you move farther away from the front-line work of the organization.", "Again, recognize this but push through this discomfort. That is why you are in this position\u2026not because you have all the answers, but so that someone else doesn\u2019t have to make the decisions instead.", "Your impostor syndrome can be your ally here too. Instead of pretending to know the right answers, lean on those that do. These are typically the same people who are bringing you the decision.", "Ask pointed follow-up questions about the choices. Ask about the pro and cons of the options. Ask them what they recommend. And ask them who else would have the opposite opinion. The answer is usually somewhere in this conversation.", "Build on this with your perspective on the organization from your point of view. Then make the decision. You won\u2019t always be right. But in many situations an answer that ends up being wrong is better than an answer never given either. (Plus, you learn a lot from these kinds of mistakes!)", "Fear doesn\u2019t have to be paralyzing. The good thing about the endless stream of articles, books, and social media posts about impostor syndrome\u2026is the fact that seemingly everyone experiences it from time to time.", "The other thing that I enjoy about impostor syndrome is that it drives me to show up and do my very best each and every day. When I fear that I am not good enough, I make the decision to strive to be better each day.", "To do this, I set specific goals for myself. They are seemingly small things but even the act of working towards them can reset your attitude away from the negative consequences of impostor syndrome. My list is simple:", "A strategy that helps me achieve these are journaling each day before bed to inspect areas where I fell short or encountered someone who did something I could aspire towards. If I don\u2019t have time to journal, even taking ten minutes to recount the day to yourself and highlight areas can be helpful.", "In these instances if you try to think about the situations from someone\u2019s perspective other than your own, it can help break you out of your own self-absorbed narrative to try to see how your actions impacted others more objectively.", "Additionally, each day I add one small item to my list of data science skills I need to learn. Then I either find a project to work on in my off hours, or a small practice session on my lunch break where I can break it down into simple steps to help me better understand what my team is doing.", "It is the fear of being found out that pushes me to be better. Because it isn\u2019t my family, strangers on social media, or readers of my stories that cause my anxiety of not being good enough. It is the people on my team, those that count on me to do my job and help give them purpose, direction, opportunities, and hopefully gratitude when they are at work.", "I think this is key though\u2026channel your impostor syndrome into pushing you to be better than you were yesterday. Take the lesson of humility that impostor syndrome imposes to be open to learning at any time and from anyone on your team.", "\u201cFor it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.\u201d -Epictetus, Discourses, Book II", "Your home for data science.
