Assuming this is true, we can\u2019t use the past to predict the future, because all movements occur as a result of new information. More likely than not, human behavioral effects are contributing to inefficiencies in the markets, although developed markets with faster price discovery have tightened this inefficiency.", "A market anomaly is any visible effect that wouldn\u2019t occur if the EMH was true. There are countless of possible anomalies, some with more research backing than others. Calendar related effects are well studied, some of these include:", "If any of these anomalies hold, why? It may be related to when institutions re-balance their portfolio. Payday might have an effect, increasing the selling close to payday, while increasing the selling closely after. There can be tax related reasons to why an investor wants to buy or sell at the end of the year. In Norway, you can receive a tax reduction based on losses in the stock market and pay a tax on the gains. Since this is calculated on the 31. of December, it is beneficial to sell the losers before the end of the year, receiving the tax benefits sooner, and sell the winners in the new year, allowing you to wait a year with the tax payment. If any of these effects are big enough to create a profitable anomaly is another question, which should be studied further.", "We will use the daily stock prices from the Oslo stock exchange index (OSEBX) to explore possible seasonal trends in Python. Comparing returns over each weekday, monthly returns, as well as the day of the month. We use daily close, so the returns will be the percentage change in price from the close the day before until the close for the current day. If we find anomalies, can this be used to our advantage?", "The data is downloaded from the website of the Oslo Stock Exchange:", "We then load the data into a pandas DataFrame after importing appropriate libraries. The data includes daily closes back to 1996. This is not the longest series, but a longer time frame is not always better when dealing with financial time series. Any anomaly occurring 50 years ago would probably have vanished by now.", "Plot the price series for the entire period", "Expand the DataFrame to include weekday, month, and year.", "First, we want to explore the possibility of a trend in the return depending on the day of the week. To calculate the mean, group by the weekday column and calculate the mean. Then reorder to index by Monday through Friday.", "Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays have all similar returns on average, while Wednesdays have close to zero, and Fridays have a higher return. Let\u2019s plot it in two different ways to see the distribution a little better. First let\u2019s see the weekday averages by themselves, then use a scatter plot to see how the returns for each weekday are distributed.", "Now calculate the volatility and count the number of observations for each weekday", "Since the market has been increasing by over 800% in this period we would expect the average daily return to be positive for each weekday and have approximately the same return. Monday is a bit special since it comes right after the weekend, which means that the risk from the weekend is carried over through Monday, hence it should have 3 days worth of risk. Overnight risk exposes investors to events in international markets, suggesting there would be more selling on Fridays which would drive prices down. Since the market went up over time in this period, we should also expect to see a higher return from Friday closing to the Monday closing price, and also a higher volatility. However, the opposite is happening. Monday have higher volatility as expected, but not a higher return. One possible reason might be people\u2019s moods close to the weekend, where an increases optimism leads to more buying, but I\u2019m not confident in this at all.", "To account for the longer period between Friday and Monday than the rest of the week, a more accurate analysis would look at the return from the opening to the close for each day instead.", "Now we want to test whether or not the average return for each weekday is statistically significantly different from the average return over all the days using a t-test. Let \u03bc\u1d62 be the mean of all returns with weekday i. Define the null hypothesis to be that \u03bc\u1d62 is the same as the grand mean, i.e the average daily return over all days:", "The p-value for Friday is 0.0696, which corresponds to a confidence of 93.04%. Although this wouldn\u2019t pass as significant in most practical cases, it would be interesting to look into the mechanisms and see if there is something behind this, but it might just be noise. Running 5 tests we only have a ~70% probability of not seeing a p-value below 0.0696 (0.9304\u2075 = 0.6972\u2026).", "Let\u2019s compare from year to year. Is the pattern consistent?", "Friday only beats the other days in 7 of the 24 years. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, minus some public holidays, I would like to see the \u201cFriday effect\u201d be more consistent.", "Second in our analysis will be to compare the monthly returns. Is the return better in some months than others?", "The remaining code is similar, but you can find the full notebook at my github.", "Almost like a wave-like distribution. January doesn\u2019t seem to be very high though, while December performs well. Perhaps the Santa Claus rally drive up prices in December? The Halloween effect would seem profitable on the historic data, as the only negative returns occur from June to September.", "How about the distribution for each month?", "Expect for a few months experiencing large drops, the volatility for each month appear similar. Let\u2019s see the monthly return year by year", "~1% average monthly return. Let\u2019s test each month\u2019s performance relative to the average using a t-test. By running 12 tests, note that we should require a lower p-value for rejecting the null. Using a critical value of 0.05 and assuming the null is true, the probability that we reject the null on at least one test is actually 1-0.95\u00b9\u00b2~46%. In order to be 95% to have no false rejections we actually need individual p-values of ~0.004.", "April has the lowest p-value with 0.0297, and December has 0.0538. The rest of the months have non-significant values. But as mentioned. 0.0297 is not really low enough to be significant when we have this many tests.", "An obvious flaw with the monthly return analysis is the lack of samples. We only have 24 observations, one for each year. Using a longer time frame could be interesting, but paradigms change, and if a market anomaly becomes well known, it will quickly be exploited and removed. As markets become more efficient it becomes more difficult to find such patterns.", "Finally, let\u2019s look at the day of the month.", "After running t tests on all 31 days, the three days with the lowest p-values are:", "By testing 31 days we expect that on average at least one of the tests will reject the null hypothesis, which it does.", "We observe a slight U-shape in returns. With days at the beginning and end of the month having a little higher return than the intra-month days. The plot over all years doesn\u2019t seem to have very consistent patterns, making me less confident in the predictive abilities of the U-shape.", "A problem with looking through anomalies is that we will always find some pattern, even tested significantly if we look hard enough. If we, however, use quantitative methods to find some possible anomaly, we can look further into the mechanisms to determine if the pattern has some merit. Better yet, first, find some interesting artifact about the market, and then run a quantitative test to determine its validity. This was an interesting exercise, but only that. I wouldn\u2019t suggest using this as a basis for a strategy due to the limited significance, and large variations causing a weekday or month to have returns derived from unrelated events.", "If you have a question feel free to leave a message.", "Your home for data science.
