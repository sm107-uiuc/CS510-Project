By the end of the article, we should be able to understand many state-of-the-art papers in the field of Artificial Intelligence, like the original paper for Alpha Go Zero. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Convolutional Neural Network are two fundamental concepts we should be familiar with before we can understand how Alpha Go works. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, concepts like Decision Tree, State Machine, Reinforcement Learning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search are explained in Understanding AlphaGo: how AI thinks and learns (Fundamentals).", "The purpose of this article is to make people understand how Alpha Go works, but it might also raise people\u2019s interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence, which has too much information to include in a single Medium article. We are about to go into materials that are a bit more advanced, so be prepared for something that might be a bit harder to understand. I will try my best to explain these concepts in the simplest way I can.", "\u201cIt was the worst possible time, Everyone else was doing something different.\u201d", "\u2014 Bengio, co-director of the CIFAR program", "In 1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts created computational models based on math algorithms called Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) to describe how neurons might work. Simulations of neural networks were possible until computers became more advanced in the 1950s.", "Before the 2000s it was considered one of the worst areas of research. LeCun and Hinton variously mentioned how in this period their papers were routinely rejected from being published due to their subject being neural networks. Artificial Neuron was considered useless as a single one of it cannot even solve the XOR logic.", "The research was funded by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). With continuous hard work from all the researchers in the field, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton won the ImageNet competition in 2012 with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a model first created by Yann LeCun in 1998. Deep Neural Networks were in almost every single paper thereafter.", "There were other reasons why neural networks succeed so well after a long time since it was created. First of all those models heavily depends on the computational powers, as our computers have become more advanced throughout the years, they eventually became more feasible. More importantly, in order to train such advanced models adequately, it would require a huge amount of data. A large amount of data was generated daily after the internet became popular with the consumers, along with social media, eCommerce and mobile devices which adds more opportunities for everyone to create tons of digital data. These new technologies also created the demand for applications in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).", "There are two opposing beliefs in the field of Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Connectionism vs. Symbolism. Connectionism believes that the approach of cognitive science in the hopes of explaining intelligent behavior. Symbolism, on the other hand, relies on reasonings based on mathematical and logical operations. While many mathematical models succeeded in their given tasks, there is also an adequate amount of researches showing that approaches based on cognitive science do accelerate the learning process of Artificial Neural Networks.", "The term \u201cDeep Learning\u201d is a field involving Deep Neural Networks, meaning Artificial Neural Networks with one or more hidden layers. An Artificial Neural Network is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consists of connected layers of Artificial Neurons. These Artificial Neurons are also called \u201cPerceptrons\u201d and thus Artificial Neural Networks are sometimes called Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP). The values will be fed into the Input Layer, which is the first layer of the network, and the result will come out from the Output Layer, which is the last layer.", "We can think of Multi-layered Perceptrons as a voting scheme, in order to come out with a decision, each of the Perceptron in the input layer sends a weighted vote to Perceptrons in the next layer, and the next layer\u2026 until the vote is finalized in the perceptrons in the output layer. The activation functions are generally so steep in the middle to ensure the activation values lie in either end so that binary decision values are approximated. Here is a place where we can visualize how an Artificial Neural Network classifies data.", "In each of the layers, there are numbers of Perceptrons connected with each other. The mechanism between the Perceptrons can be defined by the following terms:", "There are several types of activation functions. Sigmoid Function (\u03c3), often related to Learning Curves, is the most basic one. Each activation function has its specialties. Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) is the most popular one.", "Each Perceptron will propagate its value into Perceptrons in the proceeding layer, and eventually, arrive at the output layer. This process is called Forward Propagation.", "Forward Propagation is based on Weights, Biases and the Activation Function, but what determines these values? Activation Function is selected beforehand, but for a large neural network, it would be impossible to manually select the appropriate Weights and Biases.", "In the field of Machine Learning, the models are supposed to \u201clearn\u201d from the data on its own, this learning process is also called \u201ctraining\u201d. Usually, the data is split into 2 different sets \u2014 the Training Set and the Test Set. The Training Set is used to \u201ctrain\u201d the model into a more mature state, and then the performance will be evaluated by the Test Set.", "There are many different methods to \u201ctrain\u201d an Artificial Neural Network, but the most popular one is with Back Propagation.", "Before Back Propagation, the Weights and Biases of the neural network are usually initialized randomly, in Normal Distribution. The neural network will then perform a Forward Propagation. Since the Weights and Biases are initialized at random, the result of the first Forward Propagation is usually way off. A Cost Function is then used to calculate the difference between the expected result and the output of the neural network. After the difference is calculated, it will be used to adjust the Weight and Biases of the previous layer. The process propagates backward in layers, and thus it is called \u201cBack Propagation\u201d.", "Here is a more formal tutorial on Back Propagation, as it requires some advanced math to explain. An explanation of Neural Networks and code examples can be found here, where the author uses matrix operations to simulate a neural network in Python.", "In order to process graphical data with better efficiency, Yann LeCun invented the Convolutional Neural Network in 1989. The network takes count of the spacial information on a 2D array. Convolutional Neural Network is also great for analyzing other 2D data where spacial information matters, which includes a chessboard.", "Convolutional Neural Networks are constructed with 3 types of layers \u2014 Convolutional Layers, Pooling Layers, and Fully Connected Layers. These layers with different shape and sizes will have different performance on different subjects. Research on Convolutional Neural Networks usually involves adjusting those layers and their compositions to optimize performance on target data sets.", "Convolutional Layer usually appears as the first layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. These types of layers will scan through the source layer with a filter, and put the sum into the destination layer. Some filters are good at detecting edges and some are good in other tasks, more details on different kinds of convolutional filters and their applications in Computer Vision can be found here.", "Pooling Layer iterate through the source layer and selects a specific value inside the bounded region. The value is typically maximum, minimum, average within the region. Reducing information into a smaller size is also called \u201cdownsampling\u201d.", "Fully Connected Layer is essentially a Multi-layer Perceptron, which is sometimes called \u201csoftmax\u201d and essentially does something called \u201cweighted sum\u201d.", "Convolutional Neural Network is most often used in the field of Computer Vision, which impacts many fields such as eCommerce, FinTech, Game Artificial Intelligence, Cancer Detection, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, WildFire Detection and many more.

Since Medium does not support subscript for most letters, subscripts are represented by letters inside brackets after \u201c_\u201d similar to LaTeX.", "Alpha Go Zero is trained entirely through self-play and only uses 1 Convolutional Neural Network, different from the original Alpha Go which requires 2 Convolutional Neural Networks and borrows information from professional human play.", "Alpha Go Zero takes the game board as raw input to the Convolutional Neural Network. The network then outputs a vector v and a scalar p. Monte Carlo Tree is then used to compute the Search Probability \u03c0, which is used to determine the move for the next stage of the game. In the end, a winner z is determined by the rule of the game and is used to train the model with reinforcement learning.", "And by now we have just learned how Alpha Go Zero works!!!

Before Machine Learning all the AI are hard-coded to behave the way we expect them to. Machine Learning allows the AI to improve themself independently and sometimes yields unexpected behaviors. Researchers have observed gradually increasing intelligent behaviors in AI Agents by putting them into environments and reward them with certain rules. This can be fascinating while scary to think about.", "Researches inside game environments are like math and physics. By itself, such research may be only curious to know about and fun to try out, but lacks any solid values. However, they will provide a necessary foundation for other, more applied science and engineering.
