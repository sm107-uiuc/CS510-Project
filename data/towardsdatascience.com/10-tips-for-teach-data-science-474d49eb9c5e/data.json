With so many application domains and encompassing subdomains, no one class or series of classes can ever hope to cover the world of data science. Additionally, I want to highlight that everything here is simply my view of the data science world \u2014 a world I have studied, but only recently been emersed in.", "With that being said, I still believe there are a number of useful suggestions that can help supplement student learning in the classroom when it comes to data science. As I transition from classroom learning to the business world, I can\u2019t help but notice the disconnect between the two and how this gap could be mitigated. Below are 10 tips that I believe will not only further enhance the data science learning experience, but also help to prepare individuals for careers in data science.", "One of the first things you learn in computer science is that variables should be appropriately and succinctly named. A name too long is inefficient to type and makes code clunky. A name too short may not be representative enough of the variable\u2019s contents. There seems to be some sort of middle ground sweet spot, but how do you find it. My advice for the best naming practice is to create the shortest name possible, such that a person other than yourself (with limited to no knowledge of the code or project) can accurately tell what the variable represents.", "While the worst examples of poor naming can cause the developer themselves to forget what a variable represents, most times disobeying the rules of the name game will make things confusing for others. Poor variable assignment effects can also be seen outside the environment of one\u2019s code too. Databases often contain a plethora of examples of poor attribute naming, containing unexplained acronyms, excessive_use_of_underscores, etc. Sometimes these tactics are necessary, as variables can represent rather complex ideas and figures. However, when these practices are utilized, it is important to document these areas of confusion, so that future users or editors of the code/database (including yourself), will not be lost.", "Variable assignment is only one potential source of confusion when coding or developing a data science project. Due to the fact that certain code blocks can become rather convoluted, commenting is usually seen as a way to explain some of the intricacies. However, oftentimes comments are randomly strewn throughout code here and there and used as short term reminders for the developer, rather than designed for users or other editors of the code later on. Having readable and clean code is arguably just as important as having code that will run smoothly and therefore should be highly stressed to students. The way I see it, the more one explains what is happening within their code, the longer they can expect that code to be used in practice. If only you yourself can understand how it works then it is more likely to die once you commence working on it.", "As explained by the title of this tip, not all commenting and explaining needs to be done within the code. It is commonplace to see people develop READMEs, text files containing useful information about the program. While I consistently wrote these as an undergraduate, I didn\u2019t feel as though they were emphasized enough. One practice I have seen to reinforce the importance of clean and explained code is to allow students to review each other's code. Not only will this allow students to comprehend how important it is for an outside source to be able to understand one\u2019s work, but it will also allow students to gain perspective on different ways of conceptualizing problems.", "One of the biggest catch-phrases you will hear in the data science world is that upwards of 80% of a project\u2019s time is spent with data wrangling and cleaning. While I am not sure the 80% statistic is accurate (appears to be more like 60% from some publicly conducted surveys), it is true that data cleaning can be a time-consuming yet pivotal task in a data scientist\u2019s life. The data is a huge piece to the puzzle, and if you don\u2019t understand it and structure it the right way, your project will most likely be doomed from the beginning.", "Therefore, the classroom must teach the proper ways to explore a dataset once receiving it, along with the proper techniques to clean and wrangle it. The first step in any project should always be a deep dive into the data. Perform exploratory data analysis techniques. Filter irrelevant data points. Determine what to do with missing/null values and duplicates. Evaluate whether type conversions are necessary. Conduct data normalization, transformation, or reduction methods. A data science project\u2019s output can only be as valuable as it\u2019s input, or in other words \u2014 Garbage in is garbage out.", "A quick side note. It is my preference that real datasets are always better than fake ones. What do I mean my real? Basically any dataset that wasn\u2019t created for the sole purpose of students\u2019 learning or machine learning assignments. Nowadays there are multiple publically available dataset libraries, spanning various domains. Both Google\u2019s Dataset Search engine and Kaggle's Datasets are great starting points for students to get hands-on practice. For beginners, I would recommend either Kaggle\u2019s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster or House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. For more advanced students, I recommend letting them find their own datasets based on what interests them.", "One of the most underrated parts of Data Science is how the field relates to the second half of its title. The realm of \u201dscience\u201d differs vastly from a field of mathematics for example, as math will oftentimes contain no ambiguity and one\u2019s answer to a problem is either 100% correct or 0% correct. This is not the case in Data Science.", "By nature, a data scientist should be exploring and conducting \u201cexperiments\u201d in order to see if their preconceptions can be supported or refuted. One should develop hypotheses regarding their data and projects, and strive to find convincing evidence either in confirmation or disproval. Students must learn to fail fast, never fearing failure, but embracing it. They must learn to distinguish problems that are easy to solve (can be resolved swiftly), hard to solve (will require quite a bit of blood, sweat, and tears), and impossible to solve (impossible regardless of strategy or approach). Projects should be fully thought through and designed (and documented!) before being conducted. After all, there is a reason they aren\u2019t just called Dataists.", "Teaching and learning seem permanently intertwined in a circular sort of relationship. In order to be a good teacher, you need good students; in order to be a good student, you need a good teacher. But what is good? I believe it is more important to have the right teacher than it is to have a good one, which brings me to the main point of this tip. The goal is for the student to learn, not for the educator to teach \u2014 and therefore students\u2019 learning preferences and needs should trump the educator\u2019s.", "I want to emphasize that I don\u2019t mean the prior statement as a slight to educators in any way. I am merely asserting that if the true goal is for the student to reach their full potential, then the material must be tailored (at least partially) to them. Obviously, most circumstances involve a ratio of a singular teacher to multiple pupils, which leads to educators drawing the conclusion that it is too hard to specifically tailor the learning to each and every student. But students have commonalities between them. They have similar knowledge bases and ways of interpreting the material. The idea of this tip isn\u2019t that classes should be specifically taught to the likes of each student, but more that teaching methods, curriculums, and philosophies should evolve over time. The phrase \u201cI have taught the class the same way for the past 20 years,\u201d is a major red flag to me. I am far different than students of 20 years ago, so why shouldn\u2019t the teaching methods be?", "This one is pretty straightforward. One thing I have learned throughout both earlier education and college is that knowing how to Google is a game-changer. I honestly believe an entire class not only could be taught but should be taught on how to most effectively Google. Being able to efficiently find answers to questions when you only have partial information is crucial.", "Successful information retrieval isn\u2019t the only important aspect that should be taught in regards to Google. Data scientists also need to decipher what information should be stored in \u201cRAM\u201d (not requiring external querying) and in \u201cSSD\u201d (requiring external querying). What do I need to know off the top of my head, and what can I leave for Google to keep track of? Mastering the balance between the two will mitigate wasted time spent searching for answers and allow it to be reallocated towards more important tasks.", "While Google is a great tool to find information when you know what you are looking for, data scientists do not always have the luxury of knowing exactly what they are looking for. In school, I felt as though oftentimes the goal of assignments or projects was always spelled out to a T. But if this isn\u2019t the case in practice, why is this how projects are conducted in academia?", "It is important to contextualize assignments, not just focusing on the theory and numbers behind them, but shedding light on the business impact they can have in practice. Accuracy, precision, recall\u2026 are all great, but they are only model metrics, not model goals. For example, if I am designing a system to detect fraud, where potential fraudulent data points are flagged and sent for review, what\u2019s the more important measure of my model \u2014 precision or recall? Do I want to try and flag as many potential frauds as possible, even if it means flagging a few extra (maximizing recall)? Or would I rather make sure I am really confident when I flag a case, but potentially miss a few (maximize precision)? For this example, I would argue maximizing recall is the path to pursue, as the cost of missing a fraud case will incur a far higher cost than flagging extra non-fraudulent cases. These are the questions a data scientist must ask and figure out when they are developing models \u2014 they must drive value, not optimize numbers.", "In my opinion, the most impressive and \u201csmartest\u201d people are the people who can take complex and confusing concepts and simplify them down for someone else to digest them. There is no formula to do this, and it is highly dependent on who you are attempting to communicate the information to. A lot of people seem to love to speak in abstruse, convoluted, and disconcerted technical jargon, just to boast and appear smarter, reaffirming to themselves that they are in fact he superior mind. However, in a classroom (and in any learning environment for that matter), this holds no value.", "This, in turn, connects to a broader principle that is being more and more emphasized in the field \u2014 explainability. Complex models and results can be amazing, but these things need to be explained. The masterminds behind the genius need to be able to communicate the ideas, concepts, and value of their creation to people and groups that don\u2019t have the same background and expertise. Because of this, explainability must be stressed when developing personal projects as a student. A data scientist\u2019s job is not to be the smartest person in the room and prove that every time they speak.", "Hard skills are important. There is no refuting that. Frequently, the hard skills are what can get your foot in the door and potentially even all the way to the finish line, but the soft skills can turn an average data scientist into one of the best. And I believe this can be applied to almost any field. That core group of knowledge and expertise is downright imperative for success, but mastering the soft stuff is what can really stand as the differentiator.", "The list of soft skills that can provide benefit to a data scientist is lengthy, so I will only touch on a few that I believe to be most important. Strong communication skills and the ability to operate in a team setting can enhance not only the productivity of yourself but the team members around you. Thorough domain knowledge can increase the expected value of projects and allow you to answer the imperative questions with regards to effective implementation and business impact. Heightened critical thinking skills and a sense of curiosity will allow your knowledge domain to continuously evolve, enabling you to market yourself better. Storytelling and public speaking can mitigate the gaps between different business lines, allowing for more seamless implementation and production. As an educator, it is important to realize that these soft skills can make just as much of a difference as the hard ones.", "An important thing to keep in mind when teaching data science is that the most valuable and important piece to the puzzle is the person, not the model or machine. Being able to think through solutions, construct them for specific needs, and deploy the results are all vital, and can only be done by the human.", "Models, like data, can be diluted and transfigured to look exceptional. Again let\u2019s touch back to the fraud model mentioned above. Let\u2019s say the model has been tested and shown to detect 91% of fraud cases. At first glance, that looks rather impressive. But then under the hood, it is revealed that 80% of the test data were fraud cases, and only 20% were non-fraud cases. Therefore, if I had just developed a basic model to predict fraud every time, I would have achieved an 80% accuracy level. Yet it\u2019s clear that if the model were to be deployed, this level would not be attained.", "It is the human that must decide how good a model is, how to tweak it, and how to optimize it. Just because a model is being produced, doesn\u2019t make someone a data scientist. One needs actionable results, and this needs to be stressed when learning the discipline.", "So there it is. Those are my thoughts on areas to emphasize and things to keep in mind when teaching/coming up in the data science world. Please feel free to share other tips or suggestions below.
