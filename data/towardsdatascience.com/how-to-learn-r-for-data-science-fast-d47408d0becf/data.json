But while it\u2019s impossible to become an expert overnight, there are plenty of things you can do to speed up the learning process. I\u2019ve put together some recommendations for streamlining your path to R proficiency, based on my own experience.", "I should note right away that everyone\u2019s experiences are different. Some people learn R in different ways and still achieve success. That said, I\u2019ve got a lot of value from the following tips, as have many other people I know.", "As a language built by statisticians rather than programmers, R can seem a little different from many other languages. That said, it still shares the basic components of most programming languages. Actions like assigning variables, evaluating conditions, and calling functions are all commonplace. Thus, it\u2019s a good idea to at least go in with some knowledge of these fundamentals:", "When I started learning R, I found that knowing about these things substantially sped up my progress. It\u2019s probable that you\u2019ll learn new programming concepts by using R too \u2014 I have. But going in with at least some familiarity with the basics will save you a lot of time later on.", "Unless you\u2019re taking a paid course in R as a degree-level student, you\u2019ll want to structure your learning with another guide, like a book or a course. While it can be worth investing in these resources, you can also find good guides for free.", "This is largely what I\u2019ve done \u2014 in fact, I\u2019ve still never paid for a standalone R resource.", "As far as books go, \u201cR for Data Science\u201d By Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is an essential reference. It\u2019s free, covers all the key facets of R, and does so while introducing the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a collection of packages designed to make R more accessible and readable, and is rapidly gaining popularity. These packages have made my code far better, and I\u2019d strongly recommend learning about them straight away.", "Once you\u2019ve digested most of R for Data Science, \u201cAdvanced R\u201d is also a good next step for digging deeper into programming with R.", "If you want to supplement your reading with a course, there are some free offerings available with a quick search on YouTube. Alternatively, most of the major course-hosting sites have instructional series in R, if you don\u2019t mind paying for them. Again, I\u2019d recommend videos or courses that use packages from the tidyverse. Sticking to one R framework (the easiest one, at that) eliminates the confusion that comes from learning different approaches at once. This will also make for faster learning.", "As soon as you have enough knowledge to tackle some basic tasks or projects, start making stuff!", "Applying your skills is the most important part of learning a programming language. Without practical experience, your newfound knowledge won\u2019t sink in. So have fun with it \u2014 choose some interesting projects that\u2019ll make your life easier, and tackle them.", "The trick is to work on projects and applied problems consistently. This gets you used to project management and encourages you with the buzz of finishing a self-driven task. It also prompts you to fill in gaps in your knowledge that you might not have noticed otherwise. I often start projects with a new skill in mind to focus on. But often, new requirements surface and I end up learning other things that I\u2019d never intended seek out.", "I\u2019ve recently written about some projects that I\u2019ve found useful in my journey as an R user. If you\u2019re looking for inspiration, these should be enough to get you going.", "I can\u2019t stress the importance of project-based learning enough. Course certificates might prove that you have common R knowledge, but a project proves that you can make something meaningful.", "A good project can provoke emotional reactions and genuine inspiration from other people. They allow for creativity in design, and can even be extended into profitable applications or services. All the while, they keep your interest and inspire you to learn more.", "There\u2019s not a course certificate in the world that compares.", "R users are fortunate to be surrounded by a tight-knit community. Whatever your proficiency, it\u2019s worth taking full advantage of that fact to learn from those around you. There are a few ways to do this.", "While you\u2019re being community-minded, it\u2019s worth interacting with more advanced R users in whatever way you see fit. In my case, conversations with senior researchers and academic staff have been instrumental in developing my skills. While you don\u2019t need full-blown mentorship to learn R fast, there are times when it really helps.", "At the very least, don\u2019t learn R in total isolation. Interact with other people, share your learning experience, and watch your progress speed up.", "There are points in any student\u2019s journey where the grind gets overwhelming. The learning curve rises before you and it\u2019s hard to find the motivation to climb it. If you\u2019re anything like me, you might feel intimidated by hard new topics or lose interest from time to time.", "Keeping your practice enjoyable is vital to mitigate these feelings. Sure, there are times when problems get frustrating or your motivation might be naturally low. But if you\u2019re consistently grinding to a halt, make something just for fun.", "I often find that writing good code is pretty satisfying, even if it does something simple. Likewise, new projects don\u2019t always have to be serious and scaleable \u2014 they can be lighthearted and interesting. You\u2019ll be surprised what you can learn from recreational coding, and how consistent practice can lead to fast-paced progress.", "Hopefully keeping the points above in mind will speed you towards R mastery. Although I\u2019m giving tips about learning R, I won\u2019t pretend that I know everything. At the moment, here are a few things I\u2019m doing to keep progressing with R.", "I still have a lot to learn, but with a steady stream of new packages and versions being released, so does everyone. So seek new understanding with curiosity, and enjoy the learning process.", "You\u2019ll be rewarded with great progress.", "Want to read all my articles on programming, data science, and more?
