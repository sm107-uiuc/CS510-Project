It\u2019s a great skill to have \u2014 would even say a must for your CV \u2014 but clients wanting data science project delivered in PL/SQL is complete and utter idiotism.", "But SQL does not equal to Databases. I love databases for their data storage capabilities, mainly for the reason that data is more secure than with CSVs \u2014 nobody can double click and open/alter your table in Excel.", "For that reason, I\u2019ve decided to write this article, because for some reason finding stuff online on this topic posted after 2010 isn\u2019t as straightforward as you might think (and a LOT has changed since then).", "To connect to the Oracle database you will, of course, need the database installed on your machine. My machine has 12c version, so there are no guarantees everything will work on older or newer versions.
