We see the exponential decay that the retention curve has, which also highly characterize the behavior of the users in the app.", "Our aim in this article is to predict this exact curve for a given cohort, in order to estimate how well these users will stick to the app, how many active users we predict to have from this given cohort, and so forth.", "So, after understanding what retention means, we can go ahead and think about possible solutions to the problem at hand.", "We will go through these 3 approaches throughout this article and compare them to achieve the best method to estimate the retention curve with.", "The next step in our journey is to formulate the retention curve in a parametric manner.", "As we\u2019ve already covered, the retention curve resembles an exponential decay. Due to that reason, we can formulate this curve by:", "We have two parameters in this equation: b (intercept) and c (slope).We can see that we can formulate the retention curve pretty good when using this estimation to formulate the behavior of the retention curve we\u2019ve seen earlier:", "Thus, our aim in the 3 methods suggested above, is to estimate the parameters b and c, in order to make the curves as closest as possible.", "Method 1: Average Retention CurveIn this section, we will seek to find the average behavior of our retention curve.Since the curve can be defined in a parametric manner as we\u2019ve seen in the last section, we can just find the average b and c of our cohort\u2019s distribution. These average will serve as the average retention curve.", "As we can see from the plot above, the average curve shows decent results, achieving near 0 error on average, with error bars hovering around the +-2.5% from the actual retention curve.", "Now, for this section, the performance we\u2019ll show really depends on how much data we actually have. Logically, the more data we have \u2014 the more accurate we will be. For example, based on 5 days of data, we get pretty bad results:", "We see that in comparison to Method 1, we are no longer on the 0% error line, as we see a shift down. The standard deviation, however, did reduce. That is due to the personal treatment we impose for each of the cohorts.", "On the other hand, if we wait a bit for more data, we can achieve much better results than Method 1. Here for example are the results based on 18 days of data instead of just 5 days:", "Wow! that\u2019s a big improvement. We achieve a very low error with far lower variability in comparison to Method 1.", "These last two graphs can serve as sort of an intro to the third method.We\u2019ve seen that we got advantages from both methods in different situations.When there\u2019s a lack of data, we might probably prefer sticking on the average curve, but when we have a sufficient amount of data, we will no longer need the average behavior, since we can already rely on what we see from the specific cohort.", "This way of thinking fits exactly to the Bayesian approach in Method 3. In the Bayesian approach, we will have a prior (which in this context, will be represented by the average retention curve parameters), a likelihood function (which will be represented by the actual data we\u2019ve seen so far), and from these two components, we will form a posterior, which will encompass the information gathered from both components and form a unified measurement.", "Since we do not have the normalization constant, we will use the MCMC algorithm to overcome this hurdle.", "Method 3: MCMC Based Retention CurveUsing the explained method, we will achieve these results after 5 days of data:", "We can see that the new (green) method sticks around the prior data when the evidence is low. There is some weight to the actual data but it doesn\u2019t pull the posterior based model very much.", "Now, when based on 18 days of data:", "We now see how the posterior is shifted towards the actual data, leaving the prior knowledge behind as it should.", "We went through 3 methods to estimate the retention curve. One is based on the average behavior, one is based on the actual data, and the one that performed best, the MCMC method, took both actual and prior data into account.", "I hope you found the information useful and will help you form your company\u2019s retention curve as well!", "Your home for data science.
