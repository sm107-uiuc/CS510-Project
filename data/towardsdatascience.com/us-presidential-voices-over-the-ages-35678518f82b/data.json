Their delivery of that information will affect the public\u2019s reception to the message and ability for action to take place.", "Using data science techniques and tools for Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning, I set out to better understand Presidents\u2019 use of their speeches\u2019 power by examining the sentiment, sophistication of speech, and focus of content for over 990 presidential speeches. I would then look for trends, patterns, and other insights over time and by political party.", "From George Washington\u2019s 1789 First Inaugural Address to Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1977 Address to the Nation On Energy to Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 State of the Union, every president to date (year 2020) has representation in the speeches that were analyzed in this project*.", "With that, here are my findings\u2026", "Tools used: TextBlob\u2019s polarity and subjectivity", "Speech sentiment was measured in two ways: polarity (i.e. more negative/sad in tone to more positive/happy in tone) and subjectivity (i.e. more fact-based to more opinion-based).", "Below are the sentiment analysis results where each dot represents a different President and each color represent a political party >", "As you can see in the graph, there are no strong clusters of colors, meaning there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear distinction of sentiment of Presidents by party \u2014 it seems to be more of a shift by individual.", "Here you can see names of Republican Presidents >", "And here you can see names of Democratic Presidents >", "From these graphs we can see for example that compared to other US Presidents, Franklin Pierce was on average more negative/sad in tone and more factual in content, while Donald Trump is on average more positive/happy in tone and more opinionated in content.", "Keep in mind that polarity and subjectivity does not tell us what that President is saying; a President could be saying something positively but it could have negative impacts on people. This sentiment analysis only tells us how that President is delivering that content and whether they\u2019re using facts or opinions to back their statements.", "Tools used: textstat\u2019s grade level analysis", "\u2018Sophistication of speech\u2019 is a measurement based on what grade level a person would need to be in order to read text \u2014 adapted here to mean grade level required to fully understand a speech when hearing it.", "The below graph shows how each speech over the years is rated at grade-level required to understand it. Colors still represent political parties >", "From the graph we can see that in the early years of the United States, Presidents had a higher sophistical of speech, on average requiring a college-level or higher education to read/understand it. Then around the 1920s there is trending dip down in sophistication of speech that has continued through today. A potential reason for this could be the President\u2019s own vocabulary, or it could be a more calculated decision; the 1920s was a period when radios became more popular in households \u2014 as presidential speeches were able to be heard by more, did Presidents change their vocabulary to relate and connect more widely with the public hearing them? This analysis cannot tell us definitively, but it\u2019s an interesting area for exploration.", "Also note that political parties are mixed in all grade levels, indicating that there is no clear difference in terms of sophistication of speech by political parties.", "Tools used: Unsupervised topic modeling with gensim\u2019s LDA model", "Now let\u2019s try to get a better sense of the content of the Presidential speeches.", "Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, seven topics were identified for Presidential speeches:", "What\u2019s important to note between these topics is the positioning and balance of words, such as looking at \u201cWar with American freedom\u201d and \u201cWorld peace with war & force\u201d where a goal is buffered with other objectives, such as going to war\u2026.to have American freedom. Or finding world peace\u2026.but will also have war and force.", "Here are the how the seven topics have trended in presidential speeches over the years >", "Again we don\u2019t see a lot of distinction between parties on on topics of speeches and instead see more difference over time. In the early years as the United States was developing we see that \u2018Laws, treaties, and action\u2019 and \u2018Public power and duty\u2019 were more common. Then in more recent years we see that \u2018American jobs and family help & needs,\u2019 \u2018World peace with war & force,\u2019 and \u2018War with American freedom\u2019 are more popular for Presidents.", "Let\u2019s examine these topics in another way by looking at where a topic appeared in American history according to different US historical periods. Colors represent each political speech topic >", "From this graph we can see that certain historical periods seem to serve as the ending or advent for topics of presidential speeches. For example, during the era of the New Deal we first saw \u201cAmerican jobs & family\u201d rise to be a primary topic of a presidential speech and we continued to see it show up in nearly every era since.", "In summary, here\u2019s what the analysis of this project told us:", "Finally, I want to again emphasize that this analysis showed some trends and patterns, but also equally important showed us that on the surface there can be similarities of tone and positioning of speeches across Presidents and political parties. With that in mind, we\u2019ll all need to pay attention to the deeper substance of Presidential speeches to make informed votes and informed support for Presidents. That may not be a revelation, but it is a critical reminder.", "Thank you for reading and hope you found this analysis and insights interesting.
