Since then, the treatment and reception of music have evolved alongside American culture. Not having experienced the 80s/90s music in its fullest capacity, I started to think about the structural disparities between the 80s/90s and what we listen to today. When I read this article by Kish Lal, I was intrigued by the huge advancement hip-hop has made. Most rappers in the 80s/90s would make \u201crebellion\u201d hip hop as a social-political movement to voice Black struggles; Now, Kanye West paved the way for \u201cemotional\u201d hip hop which has become increasingly popular.", "\u201cWest represented the future. The changes would be heard sonically but would also dictate changes in the culture.\u201d", "So, what qualities of hip-hop changed? Since it would take a while to listen to a bunch of 80s/90s hip hop, I took advantage of Spotify\u2019s API so I could extract the \u201cmusic attributes\u201d of multiple tracks at a time. My goal here is to examine music data to find what components of hip-hop have changed; By using Spotify\u2019s API and data visualization tools, I\u2019m hoping to garner insights as to what made Hip-Hop music popular in the 80s/\u201990s compared to today as well as the role it plays in newer generations. With data visualizations, it will be easy to draw the differences between the 2 types and graphically see how hip-hop preferences have changed.", "In Jupyter Notebook, I used Spotipy (a Python library for the Spotify Web API) to get the music data from each playlist. I also used pandas so I could create a data frame and save the dataset.", "After this, I used a function to get the IDs for every track in my playlists. For this, your Spotify username and Spotify playlist URI are needed. To get the playlist URI you go to the playlist, click the 3 dots, click share, then \u201cCopy Spotify URI\u201d.", "This next part retrieves all the track attributes such as release date, popularity, album, and all the audio features which can be found in the Spotify API. The list of attributes I used is below and I will later show the definition of each attribute.", "I looped over the tracks, applying the function above, and saved the dataset to a CSV file because I will be using RStudio to graph the datasets.", "4. I repeated the process above again for the modern hip hop playlist and used RStudio to graph, compare, and find differences between the 80s/90s hip hop and new hip hop.", "Here\u2019s a list of the features/attributes that I used during this process (you can see all the attributes here) :", "After rendering the graphs, I noticed the differences in danceability, speechiness, and instrumentalness were negligible. Most of the critical differences came from properties like energy, valence, tempo, loudness, and acousticness.", "What relationships we will look at:", "The reason I chose to compare the attributes to valence is that the valence of the music in the 80s/90s and now has the largest difference and the energy, tempo, loudness, and acousticness are factors that would most likely change the positivity/mood of the song.", "New Hip Hop: (trend) no clear trend and mostly scattered; (observation) the mode of the songs is near a low valence value (~0.3) and a medium energy value (~0.5), meaning these tracks mostly have a negative/depressed sound and are somewhat intense/energetic.", "Old Hip Hop: (trend) there does not seem to be a trend; (observation) the mode of the songs have a high valence value (~0.7) and a medium to high energy value (~0.7), meaning most tracks in this playlist are happier/optimistic songs with an energetic and louder feel. Some tracks with lower valence values also have high energy values, which is why there is no specific trend.", "New Hip Hop: (trend) the higher the valence, the faster the track is; (observation) The mode of the tracks contain fast tempos (~140 bpm) and a medium valence (~0.5). The tracks in this playlist vary in tempos; the more negative sounding ones are usually slower and the positive-sounding ones are faster.", "Old Hip Hop: (trend) There is no clear trend. (observation) The mode of the tracks in this playlist are near a slow tempo (~90 bpm) and a very high valence (~0.8). Happier sounding songs in this track are mostly slower songs but some tracks with a very low valence are also around 90 bpm.", "New Hip Hop: (trend) No trend. (observation) Despite the valence value, almost all tracks are loud (~-5 decibels) which is probably due to production tricks and equipment available to musicians now than in the past.", "Old Hip Hop: (trend) No clear trend. (observation) Higher valence songs seem to vary from -15 decibels to -4 but most tracks have a medium to high loudness (~-6 decibels) with a high valence.", "New Hip Hop: (trend) No trend. (observation) Despite the valence value, most tracks have low-medium acousticness (~0\u20130.3). Newer music seems to contain a lot more natural sounds like piano, guitar, unprocessed human voice.", "Old Hip Hop: (trend) No trend. (observation)There is much less variation since most tracks in this playlist have a high valence and low acousticness (~0.0). These tracks mostly have less natural sounds like electronic beats and guitars.", "I covered some of the most important differences in New and 80s/90s Hip Hop above and now I\u2019m going to talk about them more in-depth by providing some examples and explanations/conclusions to how hip hop preferences have changed.", "The major difference between the 80s/90s and New Hip Hop is valence. Our current generation is more into less optimistic, depressing songs while hip hop in the 80s/90s was much more positive and forward-looking which correlated with a higher intensity and energy level. There was quite an obvious trend for both playlists which was the lower the valence value of a track, the less energy it contained.", "The best examples of positive hip hop in the 80s/90s are \u201cThe World is Yours\u201d by Nas, \u201cU.N.I.T.Y.\u201d by Queen Latifah, \u201cFight the Power\u201d by Public Enemy, \u201cSelf Destruction\u201d by The Stop The Violence Movement, and \u201cWe\u2019re all the Same\u201d by Gang West Coast All Stars. Hip hop in the 80s/90s was a \u201csocial-political movement\u201d and these are just some of the many upbeat and hopeful songs that talk about Black on Black crime, stopping gang violence, encouraging unity, life lessons, and inspirational, positive messages for young blacks.", "New Hip Hop is a lot less positive/dynamic than Original Hip Hop was. Some examples include \u201cGifted\u201d by Cordae ft. Roddy Rich, \u201cWishing Well\u201d by Juice Wrld, \u201cParalyzed\u201d by NF, \u201cNobody Else\u201d by Futuristic, and \u201cPerfect\u201d by Logic. One of the differences is that most hip hop artists today talk about money and fame as well as struggles with addiction, mental health, their past, trying to be the best, competition with other rappers, etc. They don\u2019t hold back to open up about the dark sides of their mind as well as the rich sides of their life. Not to say that rappers today don\u2019t contribute to the movement against racism; many still do but all their songs most likely aren\u2019t revolved around one point. There\u2019s much more variety in the things they talk about in their music and fans seem to like that openness and variety.", "Music about the Black movement in new hip hop seems to be on a rise, especially now, with songs including, \u201cThought Vs. Everybody\u201d by Black Thought, \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d by Lil Baby, \u201cRoots\u201d by Anime, and \u201cFreedom\u201d by Beyonce ft. Kendrick Lamar. So, the \u201csocial-political movement\u201d may be coming back in hip hop music but they will most likely be \u201cless happy\u201d sounding than it would have been in the 80s/90s.", "Newer hip hop has more acoustics, meaning more tracks consist of guitar, piano, orchestra, or natural human voice. 80s/90s hip hop consisted of electric sounds such as electric guitars, synthesizers, drums, and auto-tuned vocals.", "Electro-Funk, EDM, and techno were some of the electro sub-genres of hip hop that were popular during the time so most music most likely included elements from electro music; this is why acousticness values are low despite their valence values. Some examples of songs with electro elements include \u201cDa Rockwilder\u201d by Method Man and Redman, \u201cInsane in the Brain\u201d Cypress Hill, \u201cSurvival of the Fittest\u201d by Mobb Deep, and \u201cI Get Around\u201d by Tupac.", "We can see that newer hip hop artists make songs that are much more varied in valence values in the graphs. Since artists now make less positive songs, electro elements in old music wouldn\u2019t fit the new tones and emotions that newer artists are trying to bring out. Acoustic elements like piano, guitar, and natural voice are used a lot more often even despite the valence. Despondent songs tend to use more acoustics as their backdrop because it incorporates an element of softness and even higher valence songs use some acoustics as well. In my opinion, the use of acoustics is the best way to bring out the emotions of listeners and make it easier for them to connect with the music in the way the artist wants them to. Examples include \u201cMarmalade\u201d by Mackelmore, \u201cSoul Food II\u201d by Logic, \u201cI Miss the Days\u201d by NF, and \u201cAint Easy\u201d by YoungBoy Never Broke Again; most of these use natural vocals or piano in the background. Acoustics is a more popular used element now especially in the Lo-Fi subgenre of Hip Hop where there are usually no vocals or words.", "Newer hip hop music has mostly a faster tempo than 80s/90s hip hop. This is understood best if you listen to 80s/90s hip hop and compare it to today\u2019s hip hop. You can notice that in general older artists like Nas, 2Pac, IceCube, and Dr. Dre rap a little slower and stretch their words while many artists today rap a lot faster like NF, Logic, Quadeca, Drake, Migos, etc. High valence songs in newer hip hop have fast tempos as well as lower valence songs and a lot of lower valence songs are rapped a lot faster than the more positive songs (NF (less positive) vs Future (more positive) is one example). There seems to be a general trend where the slower the tempo the less wordy the song and you see a lot more variability in the tempos of new hip hop than you see in 80s/90s hip hop.", "For this attribute, New Hip Hop and 80s/90s Hip Hop have mostly the same values for loudness concerning their differing valence values. Most new hip-hop have lower valence values and are loud; most 80s/90s hip hop have higher valence values and also loud. One of the major things that may be contributing to newer hip hop being a little louder than older hip hop is the increased use in instrumentals and hip hop beats including bass, high-frequency percussion, drums, and newer elements that add to the dynamic of new hip hop.", "Throughout this project, I was able to compare the 2 generations (80s/90s and today) of hip-hop by using data visualizations to find what attributes have substantially changed as a result of shifts in hip-hop culture, artists, and generation preferences. I also came to an understanding of what would make a popular track in each generation. It may still be confusing as to what exactly hip-hop is; but interestingly, the characteristics and preferences of hip-hop inevitably change with time. Hip-hop is a forward-thinking genre because as time passes, more artists use new techniques or emphasize different musical attributes in their music. An unthinkable amount of people are also making tracks online and driving hip-hop culture and each of them likely has something new to bring to the genre, adding ever more variability to the music industry.", "Your home for data science.
