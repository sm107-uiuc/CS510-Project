We see companies sometimes use them interchangeably, but looking at job descriptions and tapping into personal experiences, there are some clear examples that highlight their discrepancies. Also important to note is what really makes them similar. Below, I will be outlining and discussing the distinctions of both roles as well as their respective similarities. I will also be performing a deep dive into the skills required for each role, in addition to the goals associated with that same role. Continue reading if you would like to learn more and discuss the Business Analyst vs Data Analyst positions.", "A Business Analyst measures all parts of the business to ensure maintenance and growth is occurring in the company. You can expect to create, develop, or maintain important metrics, also known as KPI\u2019s (Key Performance Indicators). You will quantify the business so that important decisions can be made about a sales process or a product improvement for example. You will investigate both internal and external parts of the business and therefore find anomalies in a process that will ultimately help to make the company more efficient and successful. There are certain tools you will employ like SQL, visualization tools like Tableau, and you will present findings to stakeholders. This role is customer-facing centered, even if the \u2018customer\u2019 is internal.", "Here are some of the skills a Business Analyst can expect to employ:", "Some of the skills required to be a Business Analyst were listed above, and they compose both technical and soft-skills. This combination includes analytical tools and in-person (or virtual) discussions with others within and outside of the company sometimes as well.", "Here are some of the goals a Business Analyst can expect to employ:", "The goals of a Business Analyst are straightforward. However, you can expect to use a variety of tools to achieve those respective goals. As you will see, there are overlapping skills that both a Business Analyst and Data Analyst employ.", "It may have seen that we have just described a Data Analyst above. But, there are some more differences within the Data Analytics role, as well as some of the skills and goals that are focused on in this position. A Data Analyst can expect to focus more on the data of the company more than that on the impact of that data. They ultimately will perform both, but the focus will be less on presenting to stakeholders, and more so on the data warehousing, data tables, and SQL code developed to create those business metrics.", "Here are some of the skills a Data Analyst can expect to employ:", "The skills of a Data Analyst are more focused on the technical parts of the data, rather than the non-technical or business-focused analytics. You will focus on the analysis of the data itself, rather than the analysis of data on the business.", "Here are some of the skills a Data Analyst can expect to employ:", "The goals of a Data Analyst include making sure that data integrity is sound \u2014 that SQL queries are optimized for efficiency, time, and money. You can expect to work with Business Analysts, Data Scientists, and Product Managers to serve the data and metrics or calculations from SQL queries to serve new data.", "Already discussed on a high level, there are clear differences between a Business Analyst and a Data Analyst. Of course, yes, there are sometimes where companies define them almost equally, and some companies are even unaware of which is which. What is important is how you define either role to the employee being interview so they know what skills and goals are required and aimed at once they start their everyday work.", "As you can see, the differences actually do map back to their name. What\u2019s in their name? The focus and importance of data on a Data Analyst role, and the focus and importance of business for a Business Analyst. Now, something that was thought to be confusing and unambiguous, is now pretty clear.", "Now that we have established that these roles in fact are different, let\u2019s delve into what makes them similar. Of course, they both incorporate data in their everyday work and functions. Some similar tools both roles can share include SQL and Tableau. Depending on how data-oriented or business-oriented your specific role is, you can expect to focus on more of the SQL side of things or the visualization, shifts, and trends of the data side of things.", "The goals sometimes can overlap as well, including but not limited to utilizing data to inform the company of its success in some way.", "Perhaps it is a bit of a surprise that there are more differences than similarities after investigating these two roles. Of course, these are not all of the differences and not all of the similarities. Some companies require a Data Analyst to do a Business Analysts\u2019 work, while the same is true for vice versa.", "It really does not matter when it comes down to it, other than your expectations on the role, and the expectations of the company on you.", "If you get hired on to become a Business Analyst and find yourself creating new tables and other data architecture manipulation, then maybe their job description was off, and you can meet with your manager or the recruiter (hopefully before) to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, and goals of the position. The same can be said about being hired as a Data Analyst, and holding meetings with the CEO of your business going over Salesforce metrics, when you were expecting to only query data, not present on it with other CRM tools.", "I hope you found this article both useful and interesting! Feel free to comment down below your experience as either as a Business Analyst or Data Analyst, or even another similar role and how they differ from what I have shared, and how they are similar as well.
