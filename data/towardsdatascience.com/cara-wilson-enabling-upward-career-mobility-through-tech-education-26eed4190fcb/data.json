Particularly, in the Philippines, only ~50% of working-age women participate in the workforce \u2014 and almost half of them are employed in \u201cunstable jobs.\u201d\u00b2 One organization is leading the charge to create a community of Filipinas in technology who are empowered to break through this glass ceiling.\u00b3", "For the Women Foundation (FTW Foundation) is a Philippine non-profit providing free data science and artificial intelligence training for women. Their mission is to \u201cchange women\u2019s lives through intensive tech-skills training to enable upward career mobility.\u201d\u2074 FTW Foundation\u2019s first data science cohort achieved a 286% average increase in monthly salary after their 14-week program. Moreover, 92% of their scholars landed data science jobs in only 6 weeks.\u2075 Founded in 2018 , FTW Foundation has trained and placed close to 100 scholars to date. Through their impact, FTW Foundation has pioneered a movement \u2014 no matter a women\u2019s socioeconomic and academic background, each FTW scholar who has pursued the program had an unwavering goal to help the Philippines by solving some of society\u2019s greatest problems through technology.\u2076", "As a Filipino-American who grew up in Manila, Cara Wilson pursued her university studies in the United States, before spending 22 years living and working in Milan, Italy. She studied History at Harvard College, and then worked in advertising in New York and Manila. Shortly afterward, Cara completed an MBA at SDA Bocconi in Milan, Italy before working and raising a family there. \u201cI guess you can say I made my home in three continents!\u201d Cara said, when I asked her about her background.", "Amber: Did you always know that working in technology was what you wanted to do?Cara: Not at all. As a Humanities concentrator and a Marketing executive, I was always of the opinion that technology was like a foreign language to me. Since I love languages, however, I guess that was a pleasant discovery in the end. Technology can be a great equalizer and this is what FTW leverages.", "One organization is leading the charge to create a community of Filipinas in technology who are empowered to break through this glass ceiling", "A: What inspired you to pursue a career in data science, and start For the Women Foundation? And what perspective did your experience in marketing, as well as your degree in history, contribute to that decision?C: First of all, I would like to clarify that I am not a Data Scientist but I have had to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of Data Science/Analytics in order to deliver on the FTW mission to empower deserving women into this promising career. While I was in Milan, I met so many intelligent Filipino women that were trapped in domestic work even though they had the education and potential for much more. This all happened because there was a lack of promising job opportunities in the Philippines and they had to work abroad in order to send money home and support families. In the Philippines, this meant a generation of kids growing up without their mothers and sisters. I wanted to be part of the solution to try and change this one day. It has been a very rewarding experience.", "I think a degree in History is a perfect way to launch yourself into any career \u2014 it not only teaches you to write but gives you a well-rounded perspective and the ability to take a lot of information and extract key learnings in a concise manner. As a marketer, I am keenly aware of the importance of communication and these are all skills that are important in what I do. I think my thinking and analytical processes are enhanced by having had this background.", "A: What was the biggest challenge you faced when starting FTW Foundation, and how did you overcome it?C: Well, I think I am going to have to be practical and say fund-raising was \u2014 and is \u2014 tough but somehow, since I am passionate about what I do, the universe seems to be on our side and things have worked out. I also think finding dedicated instructors that believe in our advocacy has also been a challenge. Data Scientists are mostly young professionals who are busy building their careers, and it is tough to ask them to take some time away from that and dedicate time to teaching. However, once we find the right ones, they are quickly impressed by how driven and engaged our women scholars are and this is a great source of inspiration. They can truly see how this work allows them to continue to work on interesting data projects while really changing lives at the same time.", "FTW Foundation is spearheading the movement to increase accessibility and economic opportunity for women and career changers in tech.", "A: FTW Foundation\u2019s vision is to create a community of Filipinas in tech, who are empowered to break through career barriers. How does FTW Foundation achieve this mission, and how has your approach changed from the first cohort to your current cohort of students?C: Through our short 1.5 years and almost 100 women graduates, we have made improvements to our curriculum that reflect the realities of the Philippine job market. Sustainable employment is our success metric so this is important. We are also moving to customizing the learning experience for each trainee and we collect data to constantly improve how we select and train.", "An interesting discovery has been that we have realized how important the supportive community learning experience is in the FTW program. Women career-switchers are often victims of the imposter syndrome and you need a strong support system behind you to encourage you to go for it, even when you have doubts. This ethos is a strong force in the FTW team and in our alumni. Our graduates all volunteer to come back and mentor the next group of scholars. They believe that they were given this unique opportunity and they want to pay-it-forward \u2014 the power of this community grows with every new cohort. This has become a real asset.", "A: What advice would you have for other women who are looking to grow their career in data science?C: I would advise them to immerse themselves in all the courses, groups, webinars that are now available regarding data and data science. It is a great time to build skills and work on personal data projects. This \u201cpause\u201d is also a unique chance to think about the bigger picture \u2014 how the internet, how governments and special interest groups are using or mis-using data to manipulate their message. The role data plays has been highlighted in this [coronavirus public health] crisis and they should think about why they want to become data scientists and what role they would like to play in the data ethics arena. This may put more purpose in their career path.", "A: What do you think is the biggest challenge for the next generation of women technologists in the Philippines, and what can women who are already in the industry do to help?C: In the Philippines, the biggest challenge is offering high-quality educational opportunities for all Filipinos that lead to employment. Socio-economic gaps are large and I\u2019m afraid these economic inequalities will be even more apparent as this covid crisis moves forward. Finding these opportunities and having the resources to take advantage of them will be hard for many financially-challenged women.", "Women who are already successful in tech can do many things to help \u2014 host a tech workshop or webinar, volunteer for an inspirational talk, mentor a woman beginning their tech career, get involved in diversity objectives in their companies that build a supportive space that young women can thrive in. I am amazed at how many successful women really find meaning in sharing their experiences once they prioritize these opportunities to give back. They just have to make the decision to do so.", "A: How can our readers get involved with FTWFoundation?C: FTW is hiring and looking for instructors, visiting lecturers and collaborators/volunteers on many topics in our curriculum. We are also designing a new mentorship program that allows experienced data professionals to get to know our trainees individually and really shape their first steps in beginning their data careers. This is an inspiring experience that benefits both mentor and mentee and it can be done remotely. I would love to hear from anyone interested so please contact me at cara@ftwfoundation.org so we can explore collaboration \u2014 these are just some of the possible ways to get involved but there are of course, many others.", "FTW Foundation is spearheading the movement to increase accessibility and economic opportunity for women and career changers in tech. More than just improving the technological literacy and skillset of women, FTW Foundation has taught their Filipina scholars to believe in themselves, and strive for a better future.", "To learn more about For the Women Foundation Philippines, feel free to connect with them through the following platforms: On their website: https://www.ftwfoundation.org/Via Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ftwfoundation/On LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ftwfoundation", "Special thanks to Cara Wilson for allowing me to interview her for this series, and a huge shout out to the TDS Editorial Team for supporting this project.", "Do you know an inspiring woman in tech who you would like featured in this series?
