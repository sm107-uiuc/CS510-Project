It\u2019s important to cross-check the work from time to time and be cautious about the work. In this blog, I will discuss, five such commonly made mistakes by Data Scientists.", "Data leakage is a scenario that occurs when a model is trained on information that will not be available to it at prediction time. The result could be a model performing really well in training and testing time but performance degrades drastically in real-life scenarios. The reason sometimes is accidentally sharing information between the test and training data-sets instead of keeping test-data unseen and untouched.", "Some possible Data leakages are :", "When a dimension reduction is performed using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), we reduce the n-dimensional data to k-dimensions (k<n) by learning eigenvectors from the covariance matrix created using training-data. The training data is transformed into a k-dimensional space by projecting the n-dimensional data in the directions of first-k eigenvectors. Then we train the model.", "During testing, the right approach is to transform the test data into k-dimensional space by projecting the n-dimensional test data in the directions of first-k eigenvectors learned from the previous step and then do the model prediction. But, if mistakenly, PCA is applied to the whole data (training + testing data), it will create unnecessary data leakage and model performance will get affected.", "Similarly, when applying an algorithm like NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation), the training on how that two matrices are learned happens during training. At test time, just the learnings are used to transform test data into required matrices. But, if mistakenly, NMF is applied to the whole data (training + testing data), it will create unnecessary Data leakages. Read this very well written blog for more details on Data Leakage.", "Having highly correlated features affects the model\u2019s performance. This is also referred to as the Curse of Dimensionality. The main issues faced due to having too many redundant features are :", "The issue of having too many redundant features can be avoided by:", "Many times to improve on training data we use features that may not be directly or instantly available during testing.", "One such example that I have faced in my work is Weather data. If we are using weather data for forecasting applications, we should keep in mind, actual weather data for the future during forecasting won\u2019t be available and the best we can get is the weather predictions. Actual weather data during training and available weather predictions during testing/live-run may have a lot of deviation degrading the model performance.", "I have faced issues when the application slows down drastically due to the wrong Data structure choice.", "If the application requires fast look up for presence of an element use Dictionary or Set in python and avoid using List.", "Dictionary/Set is the right Data structure for application with fast search needs", "Coming to the coding style, the best practice is to have a modularised code and good variable and function naming style. It adds to understandability, interpretability and incorporating new requirements and changes easier. Check this link for the best coding practices.", "Many times, Data Scientists end up reporting model performance after testing in limited data. The model needs to be tested in a good amount of testing data in production before revealing the model performance with confidence.", "With this blog post, I wanted to point out 5 common but critical mistakes, Data Scientists end up doing. A bit of caution and awareness through this blog can save you and hopefully make things a bit easier. Do comment if you feel there is something more that can be added to the list of commonly made mistakes.", "My Youtube channel for more content:", "Abhishek Mungoli is a seasoned Data Scientist with experience in ML field and Computer Science background, spanning over various domains and problem-solving mindset.
