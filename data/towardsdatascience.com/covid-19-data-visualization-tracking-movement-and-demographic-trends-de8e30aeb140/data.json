This was one of my favorite courses I have taken thus far because it taught me all about what it means to create a deceptive visualization and, more importantly, how to create an effective one.", "For our final project in Data Visualization, we were given the most open-ended specification you could possibly imagine. In the spirit of not stifling any brilliant sparks of creativity, we were told to knock ourselves out with whatever dataset or visualization we wished to produce. It was a \u201cyou get out what you put in\u201d type of project.", "My team agreed that we wanted to take on something ambitious, and we also wanted to do something that could be usable by others. We decided to design our project around COVID-19 social distancing data because, well, it felt very topical being that it was the subject of every dinner conversation at the time and pretty much the only thing on our minds. That being said, we unanimously agreed that it was imperative to offer something unique to the world that nobody seemed to be doing. We wanted to do something novel, something that would challenge us as programmers and just regular people trying to make sense of these ~unprecedented~ times.", "There are many awesome sites and trackers out there already. Johns Hopkins University has an awesome COVID-19 Dashboard that compiles data from a variety of sources and displays just about any statistic you could be interested in regarding the global pandemic. 1point3acres also has a tracker with real time updates and many informative graphs to analyze the growth rate of the virus. While these sources (and many others) are on the front lines, reliably presenting people with vital information and helping them to stay informed on all things pertaining to this crisis, our goals were slightly different, as outlined below.", "We decided to focus on data about how mobility has changed during this time where social distancing is either highly encouraged or made mandatory by state and local law.", "Cuebiq is a company that has a free dashboard with mobility insights based on cell phone data collected around the United States.", "Cuebiq Mobility Index (CMI) quantifies how far users move each day. It is calculated using a derivative factor indicating the distance between opposite corners of a box drawn around the locations observed for users on each day. Using an index allows counties to be compared against one another even if users travel different distances on a normal day. The CMI for each county is the median of the aggregated movements of all users within a county.", "CMI values can be interpreted on a scale of 1\u20135, with values corresponding to the following median distances traveled (5 = 100 km, 4 = 10 km, 3 = 1 km, 2 = 100m, 1 = 10m). A CMI of 2.5 for a county, would mean the median user in that county is traveling 250m.", "Unfortunately, this data was not available through an API call or by download of a CSV file. To wrangle the data, we actually had to download PDF files and then scrape the data using Python and other nifty tricks that we had up our sleeves. Where counties got cut off in the PDF due to long names and inadequate spacing, we had to cross-reference an external dataset to fill in missing data.", "We used the NYT open GitHub repository of cases and deaths by day in the U.S. This data came in the form of a CSV file called us-counties.csv. We wrote Python scripts to aggregate the data by county and determine the cumulative number of cases by day. Since the repository was updated daily and we felt that it was important for our app to always have the most recent data, we pipelined the process of pulling more \u201ccase data\u201d into a Bash script so that we could automatically pull and wrangle the data in a one-line command.", "Lastly, we used United States Census data to visualize demographic trends based on median income and political alignment by county. We wanted to explore how these factors may affect social distancing behavior across all counties in the U.S. This aspect of the project required a great deal of data manipulation, and it was also the most programmatically intensive due to the visualization approach we took, so we only ended up implementing two demographic filters. However, we plan to soon implement more demographic trends that may be interesting, such as education level or essential workforce percentage.", "We tried to be conscientious about how we chose to represent the demographic data. Scaling the objects by population for each county was a way to refrain from producing a deceptive visualization. This population data was also acquired from the most recently available United States Census Bureau dataset (2016).", "A note about the term: wrangling is the process of transforming and mapping data from one \u201craw\u201d data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of purposes.", "Wrangling the data from the 3 disparate sources was one of the most complex aspects of our project. It was one of those tasks that warranted either a whiteboard sesh or frequent 10-minute breaks to let the brain recharge. Our mission was to corral the data from 3 sources into 1 master container (either JSON or CSV form). Though the data was organized according to a variety of different schemes, this task was made possible using the FIPS code from each dataset that uniquely identified each U.S. county.", "To merge the datasets, we essentially performed an inner join on each dataset using the FIPS column as the key on which to execute the join. This yielded a dataset that we could work with to produce all of the various components of our visualization.", "That being said, the dataset was far from perfect. Inconsistencies from one dataset affected the entire combination of the 3 sources. For instance, the New York Times repository did not have county level case data for New York City because the data was divided amongst the five boroughs, which do not have unique FIPS codes. Additionally, Cuebiq did not have robust county level mobility data for Alaska and Hawaii. To handle these inconsistencies, we were faced with a decision: we had to either leave out those locations from the visualization entirely or be okay with leaving out one of the 3 data points for those counties. We elected to leave out Alaska and Hawaii (sadly), but we were okay with New York having some inconsistencies across all 3 sources.", "The following section will include a tutorial of how our site works. We will delve into the ins and outs of the application, including little implementation details which may shed light on how to best use the application to answer the questions you may have about COVID-19. If you are not interested in this technical breakdown, feel free to skip ahead to the \u201cWhat I Learned\u201d section of the article.", "Moving on to the COVID-19 tracker application itself, we can see below that the crux of the visualization is the move index data encoded by color and the ability to see how different places in the U.S. have responded to the pandemic crisis by way of social distancing as time has progressed.", "The colors on the map intentionally subvert the ingrained color scheme of a stoplight. Given that we are living through these unprecedented circumstances and that it is crucial that we all do our part to minimize the impact of this virus, we thought it would be interesting to associate low movement with green and high movement with red. It does take a bit more time for users to understand the color scheme, but since the takeaway message of our visualization has the potential to be very powerful, we thought to err on the side of confusion rather than haphazardly implying a color-based message that we did not intend to make.", "During the week of March 23rd, 2020, counties along the west coast were moving minimally relative to all counties in the United States. The counties in red had a move index of greater than 3, indicating that the median distance traveled from people\u2019s homes for that week was anywhere between 1 and 10 kilometers, which does not seem like much, but it actually speaks volumes given that this is a median value and many states had already instituted stay-at-home orders at that point.", "Central to our implementation is a temporal progression of the aforementioned move index data. By dragging the slider in the top left corner of the screen, the user can look at data from a specific week or control the speed at which they fast forward through time.", "In the GIF above, we see an animation of how different places in the U.S. have moved more or less over time since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The week with the most green and yellow color encodings is March 23rd. Interestingly, the most recent data indicates that the majority of counties have a move index of greater than 3. One could speculate that this is the result of people wearing masks if they choose to leave their homes, people going on walks and runs, better weather, loosened social distancing measures in some states, or some combination of these justifications. It will be interesting to see what the data looks like as the status of COVID-19 changes, as holidays occur, and as summer approaches.", "One of the most important and most frequently used features of our application is the animated bar chart of COVID-19 cases for a queried county. The user can query counties or click on the map to invoke this feature and explore any potential relationships between move index and increases or decreases in new cases.", "In the demonstration above, we have showcased two ways to trigger the feature. After hovering over the county geometries on the map and locating King County in Washington, the user can simply click within the shape of the county of interest to lock in that selection and set the animated bar chart in motion.", "A bar chart will appear in the grey box on the left. This chart actually depicts 2 types of data: cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in the county that was queried. There is a legend in the top left corner of the bar chart specifying how the colors denote which dataset is being plotted. Hovering over the bars of the bar chart activates a tooltip that provides all of the information for that bar \u2014 date, total cases, new cases (relative to the previous day), and total deaths \u2014 all consolidated in one place.", "One implementation goal we had was for the bar chart feature and the chloropleth map visualization to exhibit bidirectional linking. That is, a county query triggers some event and corresponds to that particular county being highlighted on the map, and an action on the map triggers the same event. From a control flow perspective, this is a complicated endeavor. However, it enhances the user experience because it enables the user to have flexibility in the way that they use the application. (It also helps them brush up on their U.S. geography if they do not know where a county is located on the map!)", "Following the King County example, there is an example of how a user can query a specific county in the event that they do not know precisely where it is located on the map. As you can see, when Santa Barbara is queried, its geographic location is highlighted on the map. The user can additionally slide the slider to explore correlations between movement in the queried county and an uptake or decline of cases in that county.", "After doing some user testing, it became evident that people naturally tend to want to explore data by city or by state rather than by county. Since we used third party data, we could not control how it was organized, but we could simplify the lookup process for the user. If a user wants to look at how COVID-19 has impacted Los Angeles, for example, they may not know the name of the county to which Los Angeles belongs (it is Los Angeles County, by the way). However, they would know by way of intuition that the most populous city is probably in the county with the highest relative percentage of cases in the state of California.", "Going off of this logic, we decided to implement a donut chart depicting each county in the queried state. The size of each slice of the donut chart encodes the relative percentage of cases for each county within the given state. As can be expected, the color encodings are consistent with the move index data that was discussed earlier. There is also linking functionality that comes into play. When a user hovers over slices of the donut chart, the geographic location of those counties is highlighted on the chloropleth map. When a user clicks on a slice, the animated bar chart is displayed in lieu of the donut chart. To go back to the donut chart, the user simply has to click on the lower magnifying glass once more.", "There are 3 main use cases worth noting with the donut chart:", "You can also click on the \u201cSwitch to Demographic Trends\u201d button to explore how move index and case data correlate with demographic trends. The default demographic is median income. The counties retain their coloring that matches up with the move index by week, but are aligned on an x-axis from least wealthy to most wealthy, according to the median income recorded in by the United States Census for each county. Because there is full linking functionality with case data, as there was this map, this view allows users to explore how income might affect where people are sheltering in place. This is an important correlation to look at, but we think it is even more powerful to visualize it!", "Per the GIF above, you can see that as the virus spread, the wealthiest counties turned green (started social distancing) the earliest. The only big outliers to that trend being lower income counties, like Los Angeles, that had so many cases that there was no choice but to stay home.", "By switching demographics, a user can also explore how political alignment might affect social distancing behavior. Using the political filter, the counties (represented as bubbles) are placed on an x-axis from 0 to 1, where 0 represents 0% GOP vote based on voter registration in 2016 and 1 represents 100% GOP vote. It is easy to see that over the weeks, the more right-leaning a county is, the more likely they are to keep moving, despite the uptake of cases in these areas in late March and early April. Even if a user is not interested in identifying demographic trends with respect to the spread of COVID-19, this view can simply serve as an educational tool: when you hover over slices of the donut chart, the bubble that represents that county is highlighted, thus allowing the user to explore demographic information by state.", "Alright, that concludes the tour of the various components of our application. Hopefully using our data visualization, you can easily interpret large amounts of data and identify trends.", "Before you go play with the visualization, I wanted to share a few reflections and lessons learned from working on this project. Many of these takeaways are very geeky hacks that I felt like sharing, but I also wanted to take a step back and comment on some non-technical aspects of the project.", "Making small improvements each day was, by far, the most satisfying part of this project. Since we started from square one, we really had to take it one feature at a time. The first working component of the project was the map with counties colored by move index data and tooltip functionality to inspect specific counties. We then got the slider working, and then the animated bar chart shortly thereafter.", "As you can see above, even when we had features working, they were not necessarily sleek right from the get go. The color scheme we used was revamped entirely, and the bar chart x-axis was fixed to appear less cluttered. We also decided to put the elements on the left side of the page in a grey box in order to compartmentalize them more elegantly.", "As for the demographic trends, getting them to all fit in one screen was actually a huge challenge. We initially used forced node collisions to produce the animation above, but we had to find a work around so that we could include this feature on the same page as everything else. Sammy came up with the idea to create a node simulation and save their final x and y coordinates so that we could have them all stay fixed in place. This was a large victory that enabled us to integrate all of the components and keep rolling out more linking functionality.", "Since the project was condensed over a time period of a little less than a month, development was often happening in parallel. When team members are working on different features but modifying the same file in various places, it is essential to work on git branches. We did not do a great job following best practices for remote development. In the future, we will definitely push new features to a git branch and then create pull requests to ensure that we do not overwrite each other\u2019s work during merges.", "\u2026 especially when are you working remotely in the middle of a global pandemic. We were working from 3 different home environments with different computer and WiFi situations, and we were not all in the same time zone. We were able to work around this by setting up a Zoom meeting every few days to check in, update each other, and discuss next steps. Though we also had a group text message to handle small technical logistics, the virtual contact was essential to our success. It ensured that we were not stepping on each other\u2019s toes and that all ideas were being laid out on the table before we proceeded onward with new features.", "All people need is a little positive feedback to feel like their hard work is not going unnoticed. This positive reinforcement can be referred to, in millennial speak, as \u201cgassing each other up\u201d.", "This takeaway is actually just an ode to Sook-Hee and Sammy for being excellent partners. Everyone contributed to the project in unique ways, which made it so fun to work together. We all had our breakthrough moments, and we all hyped each other up about these moments. Though it\u2019s a small gesture, good team morale leads to a better final product! This is not an opinion. It is a proven fact.", "Code refactoring is an agile programming concept that refers to the process of clarifying and simplifying the design of existing code, without changing its behavior. Un-refactored code tends to suffer due to way too many responsibilities per method or class, duplicate code, poor naming, poor commenting, and general confusion. To illustrate a popular metaphor, refactoring is like cleaning the kitchen as you cook or shortly after you finish cooking. The dishes, pots, food, and refrigerator must all be clean and organized from moment to moment. Without maintaining a clean kitchen, continuous cooking would either be infeasible or highly unpleasant. Similarly, developing new features is about 10x harder than it should be if the code is not refactored.", "As mentioned in the text message conversation above, this was an aspect of our project that was essential to us being able to move forward. Functions should typically be responsible for executing one task, but many of our functions were doing more than 5 tasks at once. We had to sit with the code and think about how to best modularize it to make it as reusable as possible. Make no mistake, it is not super clean even today. But the point here is that code refactoring is a continuous process, and it should not be overlooked. We definitely learned the value of writing clean code throughout this project, and more importantly, perhaps, how to take cluttered code and clean it up.", "Bash scripts are plain text files which contain a series of commands that we would normally type out ourselves on the command line, but would rather clump together in a file to execute many tasks all at once. When we identified that the process of pulling data from the New York Times GitHub repository required about 12 commands on the command line, we saw how writing a Bash script could be advantageous. We now just have to type ./pull_nyt.sh in the command line to acquire more data. This is a very simple hack that saves us lots of time and minimizes errors in file system organization. We may even look into automating the process further so that each morning at 9am, more data is pulled.", "I have discussed this in past articles, but I will echo the sentiment here. The open source community makes me believe in the goodness of humanity. It is so powerful to be able to play with demos, clone repositories, and ask for help in online forums so that we, as a community, can push forward into new domains without ever having to reinvent the wheel. Huge shoutout to the anonymous heroes on Stack Overflow who got us through this project. One day, I hope to pay it forward.", "For the longest time, I had the limiting belief that you just need to get through academic projects and hit all the requirements and then you can move on to stuff you actually want to do in the summer, when you have more free time. However, I was so wrong. Academic projects should be used as a leaping point towards something bigger, something you are passionate about. Especially when you are given the freedom to pick your topic, I believe you should pick something that does not feel like work. I know that this was a project that did not feel like work, and I definitely want to continue it with my teammates in the future. I am grateful that the assignment and deadline incentivized us to start somewhere.", "If you made it all the way here, thank you for caring enough to read this lengthy piece. We hope you gained a thing or two and feel inspired to go build something.", "You can play with our web application here.You can check out our source code here.", "We would love any feedback that you may have regarding our COVID-19 tracker application.
