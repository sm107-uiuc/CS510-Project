A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.", "In supervised learning, we have labelled training data.", "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning task that draws inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labelled responses. The goal of unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.", "Clustering and association are some of the unsupervised learning subcategories.", "A neural network is a biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data. The design of an artificial neural network is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain, leading to a process of learning that\u2019s far more capable than that of standard machine learning models.", "Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks, consists of input and output layers, as well as a hidden layer consisting of units that transform the input into something that the output layer can use. They perform very well in tasks that require to find patterns.", "It is a concept in neural networks, which allows networks to adjust their hidden layers of neurons in situations where the outcome doesn\u2019t match what the creator is hoping for.", "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where multiple layers of neural networks are stacked to create a huge network to map input into the output. It allows the network to extract different features until it can recognize what it is looking for.", "Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. One example of a task where linear regression can be used is forecasting housing price based on past values.", "The cost function of linear regression is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between predicted y value (pred) and true y value (y).", "Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is used for the classification problem.

It consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble.

Does not assume that your data is normally distributed, nor it assumes that the relationships are linear.", "It requires very few pieces of feature engineering.", "Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better performance compared to a single model.", "Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve prediction (stacking).", "Examples are random forest, Gradient boosted decision trees, ADA boost.", "Boosting is an ensemble technique in which the predictors are not made independently, but sequentially.", "It is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners. Gradient boosting is an example of boosting. It is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble or weak prediction models, typically decision trees.", "Overfitting happens when a model that models the training data too well.", "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. It negatively impacts the model's ability to generalize.", "Underfitting refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data. It will have poor performance on the training data.", "Regularization is a technique to modify machine learning models to avoid the problem of overfitting. You can apply regularization to any machine learning model. Regularization simplifies overly complex models that are prone to be overfitted by adding penalty tern to the objective function. If a model is overfitted, it will have problem generalizing and thus will give inaccurate predictions when it is exposed to new data sets.", "A regression model that uses the L1 regularization technique is called Lasso Regression. A model which uses the L2 regularization technique is called Rigid Regression.", "The key difference between the two is the penalty term which is added to the loss function.", "Rigid regression adds \u201csquared magnitude\u201d of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function.
