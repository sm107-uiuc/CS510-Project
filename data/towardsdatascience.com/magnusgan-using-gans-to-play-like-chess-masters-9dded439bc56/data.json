This is due to its innate ability to \u2018mimic\u2019 the data that is fed to it.", "Additionally, I wanted some more experience on conditional GANs (GANs that evaluate how likely the new transformation is plausible) as they feed into much more complex and challenging problems.", "In terms of data, I downloaded a large PGN file (3000+ instances) on Magnus Carlsen\u2019s (the top chess player as of right now) games online. These files are a long list of all the moves that were played in that particular game, as well as some metadata about the game itself (date, time, who was playing each side).", "The PGN can be parsed using the python-chess library. The library executes all the moves on the PGN file on a chess board, therefore converting the information into computer-digestible data.", "The data can then be converted into an array of shape (8,8,12). This is a step by step explanation how:", "An important thing to note is that as we are trying to imitate Magnus Carlsen and not his opponents, we will only record moves by Magnus Carlsen. This can be done by using the metadata to correct the decision making processes.", "Now that we have collected the data, we have to form it into a set of X and y values, so that the GAN can be trained. The X values will be the state, and y will be the resultant board, after the move that Magnus Carlsen has been played. This is as encoding a move is much more complicated (multiple pieces can get to one squares, not to consider en passant and castling) than encoding a board.", "Additionally, we have to assume that all the data necessary to make the best move is contained in the board and board only. This is a slightly flawed, as the order of the moves of the opponent could give some insight into the opponent's strategy, which means there could possibly be missing information for the GAN to make decisions.", "These risks are something that one could take note of, if they want to improve upon my project.", "The MagnusGAN is based on the Pix2Pix model. Like any other GAN, it consists of two parts, a generator and a discriminator.", "The discriminator is a deep convolutional neural network that performs image classification. Specifically, conditional-image classification. It takes both the source image and the target image as input and predicts the likelihood of whether target image is real or a fake translation of the source image.", "The discriminator design is based on the effective receptive field of the model, which defines the relationship between one output of the model to the number of pixels in the input image. This is called a PatchGAN model and is carefully designed so that each output prediction of the model maps to a patch of the input.", "The generator is an encoder-decoder model using a U-Net architecture. The model takes a source image and generates a target image . It does this by first downsampling or encoding the input image down to a bottleneck layer, then upsampling or decoding the bottleneck representation to the size of the output image. The U-Net architecture means that skip-connections are added between the encoding layers and the corresponding decoding layers, forming a U-shape.", "This script helps you check your directory. Replace the XXX in the change directory function with the directory where the PGN file is stored.", "This script scrapes all the moves, as well as important metadata to collect data.", "This script uses even and odd numbers, to make sure that the program only records Magnus Carlsen\u2019s moves. If Magnus Carlsen is white, the program only records moves of an index of even numbers (zero based index), and if he is black, it records every other move.", "This script converts a board into a matrix, and then into a matrix of one-hot encoded values.", "This script contains all the libraries and dependencies that the program needs to run.", "This is the discriminator from the Pix2Pix GAN, with the same configuration that was laid out in its paper.", "To make the generator code shorter, I have to define the smallest components of the program. That is the encoder and decoder layers that the input goes through, so that a true transformation can be calculated.", "There is some complicated linkage between the different parts of the U-net. If you really dig into the code, you might understand these connections better!", "See? Much simpler! This is the encoder-decoder generator that is the heart of the program.", "This script links the discriminator and the generator together, where the output of the generator is fed into the discriminator, as well as the ground truth that the transformation is based on.", "For the sake of simplicity, I have written these functions to draw data from the datasets, as well as to use the generator to generate fake samples to trick the discriminator.", "This script runs the whole program, and keys in the parameters to all the functions so that the program runs smoothly.", "This final script outlines the large parameters and calls the train function.", "This program picks random instances from the program and uses them as the input data for the GAN. It then accurates the transformation. I haven't found an efficient way to convert it into the python-chess board so that it can be rendered.", "As this program is all in a spirit of good fun, I inputted another great chess player\u2019s data into a bot, creating the possibility for Hikaru Nakamura to play against Magnus Carlsen. Try these different options, or even play the chess champion yourself!", "If you want to see more of my content, click this link.", "Your home for data science.
