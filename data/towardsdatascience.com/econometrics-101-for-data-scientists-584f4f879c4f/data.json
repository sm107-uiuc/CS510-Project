However, there is a huge opportunity for them to break into economics and social science problems at a macro scale which are traditionally subject matters of social science disciplines. Econometrics is probably the closest domain for data scientist to get in that direction. The purpose of this article is to introduce \u2014 to data scientists coming from different backgrounds \u2014 some basic concepts and tools used in econometrics and how they relate to data science practices as we know it. This is mostly an introductory post scratching the surface but if there is enough interest I might write more posts with specific tools and use cases.", "There are basically two kinds of economists: those who develop theories and those who test those theories. Econometricians are the latter kinds of people who use statistical techniques to understand and explain social phenomena that has economic dimensions.", "One example of econometrics use case is testing the hypothesis that the length of education has anything to do with wage rate and to be able to quantify that relationship using a combination of economic theory and data. Another example would be measuring price elasticity of gasoline demand \u2014 i.e. sensitivity of gasoline consumption to a change in market price \u2014 using historical data.", "Econometrics deal in the domain of all the societal problems that has anything to do with economics. The domain largely deals with macro-economic phenomena such as employment, wage, economic growth, environment, agriculture, inequality etc. Here\u2019s just a small sample of such macro-economic issues from the Journal of Econometrics:", "With some exceptions, most things in econometrics toolbox should be familiar to data scientists or any computational scientists. Here is a sample of some commonly used tools:", "In addition to statistical models, economists use a wide range of mathematical models too. In fact, economists are often \u201caccused\u201d that they are using too much mathematics in modeling human behavior. There is widespread criticism of the discipline that they try to mimic deterministic models of natural systems to describe complex human behavioral problems that are rather unpredictable or probabilistic, to say the least.", "And last but not least, arguably the most important and powerful tool in econometrics toolbox is the Panel Data Models. This topic deserves a separate post but I will briefly touch upon below.", "If you haven\u2019t heard about \u201cpanel data\u201d or \u201clongitudinal data\u201d before then here is some description if it. A panel data is basically a multi-dimensional data of an observation that is measured repeatedly over time. In other words, it\u2019s a dataset where multiple variables are measured, over time, on the same units \u2014 such as individuals, organizations, households, city, country.", "So as the name suggests, a panel data model is a statistical tool that provides information on the difference across individuals and over time. The following 4 are the most popular kinds of panel data models:", "Understanding each of these models require some discussion and mathematical formulation. This link provides a nice discussion on these modeling frameworks.", "Data scientists have a great edge in diving into social and environmental issues that society is facing today. They should not feel worried that this is a domain of economists and they are the outsiders. I\u2019d rather say, data scientists with diverse background and outside box thinking capability are rather better positioned to describe and predict societal problems than people trained in traditional disciplines.", "I\u2019m on Twitter if you want to get in touch with questions.", "Your home for data science.
