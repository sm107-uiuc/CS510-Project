It can predict whether an address belongs to an exchange, miner, or ICO wallet.", "The database was constructed using SQL, and the model was coded in Python. Source code is available on GitHub.", "The Ethereum blockchain is a platform for decentralized applications called smart contracts. These contracts are often used to represent other assets. These assets can represent physical objects in the real world (like real estate titles) or be purely digital objects (such as utility tokens).", "The computations required to execute smart contracts are paid for in ether, the native currency of the ecosystem.", "Ether is stored in cryptographically secured accounts called addresses.", "Many people believe that cryptocurrencies offer digital anonymity, and there is some truth to that belief. In fact, anonymity is the core mission of Monero and ZCash.", "Ethereum, however, is more widely used, and its broad flexibility results in a rich, public dataset of transactional behavior. Because Ethereum addresses are unique identifiers whose ownership does not change, their activity can be tracked, aggregated, and analyzed.", "Here, I attempt to create user archetypes by effectively clustering the Ethereum address space. These archetypes could be used to predict the owner of an unknown address.", "This opens up a wide array of applications:", "Participants in the Ethereum ecosystem can be separated by patterns in their transaction activity. Addresses known to belong to exchanges, miners, and ICOs qualitatively show that the results of clustering are accurate.", "Feel free to skip to Interpreting the Results below.", "The Ethereum transaction dataset is hosted on Google BigQuery. Using the 40,000 addresses with the highest ether balances, I created 25 features to characterize differences in user behavior.", "Using silhouette analysis, I determined the optimal number of clusters to be roughly 8.", "This choice minimizes the number of samples with negative silhouette scores, which indicate that a sample may be assigned to the wrong cluster.", "By scraping data from the Etherscan.io block explorer, I gathered crowdsourced labels for 125 addresses in my dataset.", "The majority of labels fell into three categories:", "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique, so I could not use labels to train my model. Instead, I used them to assign user archetypes to clusters, based on the highest label density for each cluster. Results can be found here.", "Exchange and miner addresses were mixed together in the same cluster at first. To separate them, I performed a second round of clustering, using only the addresses in that cluster.", "By changing the dissimilarity measure from euclidean distance to cosine distance, I dramatically improved separation between exchanges and miners.", "By substituting results from re-clustering into the original analysis, we end up with 9 clusters.", "We can draw conclusions about user behavior based on the corresponding cluster centroids.", "Exchanges are the banks of the crypto space. These results are intuitive.", "Miners secure the blockchain by expending computational power, and are rewarded with ether. Groups of miners often \u201cpool\u201d their resources to reduce variance in payouts, splitting the proceeds based on resources contributed.", "ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are a common fundraising method for crypto startups. It makes sense that these startups would have large war chests, and periodically sell large amounts to cover regular business expenses.", "Expanding on this work would allow a more nuanced view of Ethereum blockchain data.
