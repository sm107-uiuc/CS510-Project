Together, these trees provide over one million dollars in ecosystem service benefits \u2014 from reducing stormwater runoff and water pollution to moderating temperatures and preventing erosion. Perhaps more importantly, the City of Somerville notes that surveys have revealed a correlation between tree-rich neighborhoods and resident happiness.", "While it is clear that the city should continue to invest in its urban forest, doing so does not come without a cost. On average, Somerville needs to invest one thousand dollars to plant and maintain a new tree. Consequently, understanding how trees grow and survive within Somerville is essential to be able to efficiently allocate city resources while also producing the most public benefit.", "In order to begin to better understand their public trees, the City of Somerville has looked to leverage two tree inventory datasets, one from 2009 and a second from 2017. Each tree inventory dataset provides a rich snapshot of Somerville\u2019s urban forest at the time of data collection. However, individually, these inventories are not readily positioned for conducting cross-temporal inquiries, such as growth and survival analysis, because there are no clear associations between the records in each dataset. As a result, Somerville is searching for a way to automatically link these two datasets to produce one, single, cross-temporal tree inventory.", "For our capstone project with Harvard University\u2019s Data Science Master\u2019s program, we have partnered with the City of Somerville to solve this problem. Our aim is to associate the records of trees that appear in both datasets and identify records that appear only in one or the other (e.g. due to a planting or removal in the interim period) so that Someville\u2019s Urban Forestry group can conduct further analysis. As such, the final output of our task is a \u201ctree matching,\u201d which maps trees between the 2009 and 2017 inventories.", "A high-level review of this problem reveals that there are many obstacles we will need to overcome. Primarily, we are not equipped with any ground-truth data with which we can evaluate the performance of our model. Even if we were able to correctly match each tree, there is no way to go back in time and confirm that a tree from the 2009 inventory was the same tree as the 2017 tree to which it was matched. Consequently, we need to ensure that quality guarantees have been built into our process. Furthermore, because our work is going to be leveraged by subject-matter experts, our outputs are only as useful as they are interpretable by such experts. Utilizing a fancy machine learning model is not necessarily better than a simpler approach if it is neither interpretable nor able to be evaluated.", "With this context in mind, we began to dive into solving this problem by looking at our data. The City originally provided us with datasets of both the 2009 and 2017 tree inventories conducted. These inventories were conducted by Davey Resource Group. The City of Somerville provided us with an extensive document in which Davey Resource Group details the data collection process, including a description of each field in the dataset. Our exploration of the data found it to be of high quality and consistent with the extensive documentation provided in Davey Resource Group\u2019s manual.", "A high-level overview of the tree inventory data is seen in the figure below.", "In addition to the primary tree inventory data provided to us by the City, we identified the following additional datasets to incorporate into our project pipeline to aid in the tree matching process.", "The City provided us with shapefiles of the geographic coordinate of each tree in the dataset, which we complemented with additional shapefiles of street centerline, buildings, and parcels available to the public in Somerville\u2019s Open Data portal.", "The City also provided us with their 3\u20131\u20131 Data, which is a collection of non-emergency service requests that have been submitted to the city. This data dates back to 2015 and includes over 100,000 records of submitted tickets, each tagged with a particular issue type. We then narrowed down this dataset to just the specific issues relevant to our project.", "Lastly, we identified and sourced LIDAR data of Somerville, collected on December 8, 2013 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). LIDAR data measures elevation at a very fine-grained resolution and has been used in a lot of previous research on tree detection. Moreover, by leveraging the Python package \u201cPyCrown,\u201d which was developed by Dr. Jan Schindler to perform individual tree segmentation, we were able to get point estimates for the location of trees across Somerville at this point in time.", "The PyCrown package takes as inputs LIDAR data representing normalized tree canopy height above ground elevation and performs segmentation on this data to isolate individual trees and their coordinates.", "The figure below gives an overview of the LIDAR data pipeline. Note that, as depicted in the first panel on the left, the raw LIDAR data collected is quite noisy and includes elevation data points for the entire Somerville landscape. However, by filtering to \u201cfirst of many returns\u201d we are able to mostly isolate tree canopy from other features of the environment. This \u201creturns\u201d filtering takes advantage of a useful property of LIDAR data, which is collected via an instrument shining laser light onto a landscape and measuring the reflected beams returned. When LIDAR beams hit a semi-permeable surface, such as a tree canopy, some of the light is reflected right away while additional light penetrates further through the canopy before being reflected back later. Thus by filtering to only points where the LIDAR sensor received subsequent returned beams after the initial return, we are able to separate permeable high-elevation objects (tree canopy) from impermeable high-elevation objects (rooftops).", "We viewed incorporation of LIDAR-based tree location estimates as a way to improve confidence in the tree matching process. Because the original tree inventories were conducted by arborists viewing and uploading information about tree locations, this process and the resulting inventory tree locations were subject to possible human error. On the other hand, LIDAR-based tree detection can yield a snapshot of the locations of all Somerville trees at a particular point in time, with consistent measurements of the locations of and relative distances between each tree.", "Although the LIDAR tree detection process may be subject to its own measurement errors, we concluded that if LIDAR tree location estimates \u201cagree\u201d with a proposed match between a 2009 and 2017 tree at a given location, this serves to augment our confidence in the validity of such a matching.", "With an understanding of our data, we began to lay the framework for our tree-matching pipeline. The goal of our tree-matching model was to look for matching records between tree inventories from different times in the past. Since we couldn\u2019t go back in time to see exactly what happened to each tree, we instead aimed for a model that addressed the following questions:", "We implemented our tree-matching methodology in Python and set the following design goals for our model:", "Satisfying these goals helped us to ensure that our solution could be adapted to reflect Somerville\u2019s intended use cases and could help point to where the City might benefit most from collecting new data in the field.", "Our pipeline is split into six distinct phases (as seen in the flow diagram below). We designed the pipeline to be easily readable and interpretable, with a central pipeline class organizing and calling each of the six stages:", "In order to evaluate the results of our matching pipeline, we developed our own tool to ground-truth a subset of trees that we treated as our test data. Our ground-truthing process involved the utilization of Google Street View in order to confirm that a tree from 2017 was indeed the same tree that was recorded in 2009.", "In addition to Google Street View, we also leveraged our LIDAR data as a source of model evaluation. For each set of matches, we also examined the three nearest LIDAR points to each tree and gave the match a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to how many of the closest LIDAR points agreed across the match, with a higher value being more optimal than a lower one. We defined the average of these values across matches to be the \u201cLIDAR score.\u201d Finally, to evaluate our models, we used a combination of accuracy in proposed matches against the ground truth data as well as the LIDAR score.", "Leveraging the ground truth data, we first investigated the range of reasonable hyper parameters we could expect to see for real matches. What is the largest distance between any two matched trees? What is the most a tree has ever \u201cshrunk\u201d in terms of a smaller recorded DBH in 2017? How often were species mislabeled? This information was invaluable in generating a realistic set of heuristic rules for which to create pairs.", "In addition, we tested a number of different sets of heuristics combined with the two different algorithms (below) on our ground truth data to determine the final set of rules which produces the optimal score.", "We first turned to a classical game theory algorithm, the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm, to select an optimal set of matches from among the proposed pairs. This algorithm was first proposed in 1962, and versions of it have since been used in various important settings, including for matching students to schools in both New York City and Boston\u2019s public school systems.", "Choosing matches between two sets of trees can be modelled as a Stable Matching Problem (SMP). In a SMP, the goal is to find an assignment between members of each set, based on their ranked preferences of members of the other set, such that no two participants prefer each other\u2019s matches. In the case of matching trees between our two inventories, the \u201cpreferences\u201d of the trees are based on distance: ideally, each record in the 2009 inventory would be matched with the record from the 2017 inventory that has the closest geographic coordinates. However, given that the nearest 2017 tree could be the same for two 2009 trees, we needed a way of deciding how to resolve these conflicts.", "Thus, the Gale-Shapley algorithm proceeds in multiple rounds. Initially, each tree from the 2009 dataset it assigned the nearest records in the 2017 dataset, if that record has not already been matched. If the record has a match, it will either keep its current match or accept the new match, depending on which site is closer. This is known as a deferred acceptance mechanism, because all matches are provisional until the algorithm has terminated. In the final assignment, each tree receives at most one match from the other dataset, and matches are guaranteed to be symmetric (i.e. if Tree A is matched with Tree B, then Tree B is also matched with Tree A).", "In addition to applying a deterministic algorithm to attempt to optimize the assignment of matches from pairs we also implemented simulated annealing, a stochastic approach which leverages a Metropolis-Hastings sampler to converge upon the optimal solution. Simulated annealing is often applied in scenarios where the total number of permutations is so large that searching via an exhaustive approach is infeasible, such as the traveling salesperson problem or the assignments of students to project preferences.", "In the case of our tree matches, if a street has 50 trees and each tree has 10 plausible matches, then simplifying to assume independence of matches, the total number of permutations to test would reach 1e+50. Clearly this is intractable to search in a simple brute force methodology. Instead simulated annealing works by taking random guesses at new assignments and then checking for whether they violate any consistency constraints (for instance two trees from 2009 matching to the same tree from 2017). If any constraints are violated the proposal is immediately thrown out and a new random sample drawn.", "Whenever a consistent proposal is sampled, the algorithm calculates a loss score \u2014 defined based on the proportion of trees which are assigned to their first, second, third, etc. choices. If the loss score is an improvement on the previous configuration, then the algorithm always accepts this new proposal, having produced a more satisfying set of matches. Crucially however, matches which are sub-optimal (produce a worse score than the previous configuration) are still accepted with some probability (this is the Metropolis-Hastings step) based on a decaying temperature value. Therefore, at the beginning, the algorithm is willing to accept lower scores in exchange for the ability to explore and search different areas of the matching space. As the algorithm begins to converge, and the temperature decreases, it becomes more and more likely to only accept better matches until reaching a stationary point amongst the loss landscape. Simulated annealing is only locally optimal and its performance depends heavily on the tuning of the temperature schedule and run time.", "We implemented both the Gale-Shapley and Simulated Annealing algorithms across a number of different heuristics which can be broadly categorized into what we term strict and lenient approaches. These are two specific subsets of the hyper parameter tuning step of the pairing algorithm and can be summarized as:", "Species must match exactly, DBH must be strictly greater, and matching is limited to the five nearest trees.", "\u201cTree Species\u201d must match at the Genus level, DBH can shrink by a 1.5 inch tolerance, and matching is limited by street segment.", "We then evaluated these implementations using both our manually ground-truthed data as well as our LIDAR points. As you can see in the graphic below, in attempting to match 2009 tree records to the most optimal 2017 tree record, lenient approaches tend to perform better than more strict approaches, likely due to potential inconsistencies in the source data. Using a lenient approach, the Gale-Shapley algorithm correctly matched 94.4% of our test data. When considering how our matches compare with the tree positions in the LIDAR data, we note that all models have similar performances.", "In addition to examining how our model performed when treating 2009 trees as the base case, we also examined our model accuracy when trying to match each 2017 tree record to a 2009 tree record. The graphs below highlight how these results compare with our initial matching approach. We still observe that the lenient Gale-Shapley approach performs the best across the tested model. Nonetheless, we also note that the lenient Simulated Annealing approach also performs very well.", "To produce our final matching results, to be submitted to the City of Somerville, we used our highest scoring combination of pairing and matching algorithms \u2014 Gale Shapley with Lenient pairing criteria allowing for:", "Whilst having the tree pairs be limited only by the street segment achieved a slightly higher overall matching accuracy, it also had a higher rate of false positive matches amongst the ground truth data (increasing from just one to three when compared to limiting to the five nearest trees).", "We define false positive matches to be trees which incorrectly matched to another tree, rather than just the trees for which we did not find a match at all. Unmatched trees are not problematic in that they can simply indicate trees which were newly planted or cut down. False positives, on the other hand, would be indistinguishable from real matches and so, choosing to avoid the additional increase in false positives, we stuck to the nearest five tree matching method in our final model.", "The outputs of our pipeline after running the final Gale-Shapley \u2014 Lenient model include two csv files. The first of these files contains the model\u2019s matchings between 2009 and 2017 trees, including the trees for which it determined there was no match (those that were either cut down or newly planted). The second of the outputted csv files contains a record of all proposed matches during the matching process as well as the reasons for which they were accepted or declined. This second file thus serves as an audit trail, increasing the explainability of our model by showing its decision making process.", "We greatly enjoyed working on this problem of tree inventory matching this semester. As data scientists, we often default to using the same types of neural networks and machine learning models to tackle a problem. However, working on tree matching has pushed us to broaden our toolsets and has allowed us to gain a new appreciation for heuristic and human-in-the-loop based approaches. Such approaches can lead to results which have greater explainability, while still achieving high test-set accuracies (as our final model reached 94.4% accuracy on the ground-truthed data). Moreover, when implemented with a pipeline that allows for customizable parameters, as ours does, these approaches can lead to models which are more adaptable for different stakeholders in the future. We are proud to have developed a model that not only achieves our goal of providing Somerville with a high-quality, auditable, matching of trees, but also may be adapted in the future to serve the needs of other cities.", "With thanks to Isaac Slavitt (Harvard), Chris Tanner (Harvard) and Vanessa Boukili (City of Somerville) for their guidance throughout this project.
