Now, the quest is to learn more about its properties. AI plays a crucial role in this.", "It\u2019s Sunday. You and I are taking a walk in the park. Our dog Pluto is bouncing around us, eager to play. You throw a stick for it to catch.", "Then you turn towards me. \u2018You used to work on the Higgs boson, right?\u2019", "\u2018Yep! That was four years after its discovery though.\u2019", "\u2018What was left to do if it was already discovered?\u2019", "\u2018Well, we know now that the Higgs boson exists. But a lot of its properties are still unknown. I and my colleagues were working on strategies of how to find out whether a Higgs boson could decay into Dark Matter inside a particle collider.\u2019", "\u2018So, like, the Higgs boson breaks and the remnants are Dark Matter?\u2019", "AI could shine a light on the mysteries of the Higgs boson", "\u2018That\u2019s the theory, yes. We don\u2019t know for sure whether that really happens. But it\u2019s worth investigating. That\u2019s why I and my colleagues thought about how one could detect these decays \u2014 if they exist. And we found that Artificial Intelligence was the best way to do that.\u2019", "\u2018For that you need to understand what kind of problems we\u2019re addressing in the first place.", "\u2018At CERN, particle detectors capture what happens when two particles collide at very high energies. Each type of particle \u2014 for example, a quark or a Higgs boson \u2014 leaves a characteristic trace in a particle detector. If we put together the traces, one can reconstruct the processes that took place during a collision of two particles.\u2019", "\u2018So you use AI to find out which processes took place?\u2019", "\u2018Not so fast! Let me explain.", "\u2018In some collisions, a Higgs boson is produced. But a Higgs boson has a rather short lifetime, so it quickly decays to other particles. These could be quarks or other bosons, or maybe Dark Matter particles. The latter we call signal events \u2014 collisions where Dark Matter is among the resulting particles.", "\u2018Of course we could simply search for the signal among the many processes that the detector registers \u2014 we\u2019re talking about half a billion collisions happening each second.", "\u2018The problem is that there are events that look really similar to the signal. But in reality they\u2019re different processes. These we call background events. And we don\u2019t want those to skew our data. So our task was to teach the detector to distinguish the signal from the background.\u2019", "\u2018And how did AI come into play there?\u2019", "\u2018Without AI, we would just look at different properties of the signal, and then cut the dataset where it\u2019s pretty unlikely to find any.", "\u2018For example, one could use the number of quarks that get emitted as a by-product of the decay of the Higgs boson to Dark Matter. In addition to the Dark Matter particles, we might expect two quarks, based on the underlying physics of the process. Sometimes there may be one quark more, sometimes one less. There can be statistical variations.", "\u2018So in this example, we could cut away collisions from our dataset in which we find no quarks, or more than three. We can be pretty confident that they\u2019re no signal events. This way we\u2019ve improved our dataset because it contains a little less background than before.\u2019", "\u2018Is this where AI comes in?\u2019", "\u2018Yes, exactly. The smart thing is that we can make an AI algorithm learn the properties of a signal event. That makes our job a lot easier because it means that we don\u2019t necessarily need to know much about the underlying physics.\u2019", "\u2018You\u2019re being lazy \u2014 not studying the underlying physics!\u2019", "\u2018Okay then. And how does the AI learn what is signal and what is background?\u2019", "\u2018There are many different ways. In our case, we used really simple algorithms which are called decision trees. The basic principle is that you first train the algorithm with a fake dataset. This dataset comes from a computer simulation and only contains events which are already correctly labeled as signal or background.", "\u2018The decision tree applies random cuts to the training set and then checks how well it has separated the signal from the background. Then it re-iterates until it has found the best cuts.\u2019", "\u2018But why can\u2019t you do that manually?\u2019", "\u2018We were doing that manually \u2014 but it requires a lot of knowledge about the underlying process or else it will take a very long time. Also, it quickly gets complicated because the properties of the signal often depend on one another.", "\u2018For example, two quarks that are emitted in a signal collision might have a certain distance from another. But there might be other signal events where three quarks are involved. In this case, the distances among the three might be different than in the case with two quarks. So we can\u2019t just cut for one distance among quarks. Decision trees are good for taking these kind of dependencies into account.\u2019", "\u2018So in a way the machine knows more than you!\u2019", "\u2018True! That helps us uncover the properties of the Higgs boson.\u2019", "You throw the stick for Pluto again.", "\u2018How does that help you with the Higgs?\u2019", "\u2018With AI, we can produce really good datasets which contain lots of signal and few background events. In our case, the signal events are collisions after which a Higgs boson decays to Dark Matter.", "\u2018Now, all we need to do is count the number of signal events that we find. If we find a certain amount, we can say that we have discovered decays of a Higgs boson to Dark Matter particles!\u2019", "\u2018Nope. At least \u2014 not yet. Our paper is just one of many steps towards such a discovery. Research takes time!\u2019", "The future of the Higgs boson remains exciting", "\u2018It will be interesting to see whether you will discover it! Or whether those decays don\u2019t even exist.\u2019", "\u2018I sure will\u2026 Actually, I thought that AI was really hard to understand. But now it doesn\u2019t seem too crazy.\u2019", "\u2018To be fair, we used one of the simplest AI tools that exist. These days, scientists often use more sophisticated algorithms, including supervised deep learning and GANs. But we can talk about those another day if you want.\u2019", "\u2018I\u2019d love to!\u2019 you exclaim as you try to wiggle the stick out of our dog\u2019s mouth. \u2018Come on Pluto, we\u2019re going back home!\u2019", "Your home for data science.
