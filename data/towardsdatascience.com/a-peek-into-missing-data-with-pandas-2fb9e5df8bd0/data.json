Missing data is extremely common in practice and can have a large effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data, hence why a huge portion of Data Scientist time is attributed towards data cleaning.", "There are various reasons why we may have missing data, for instance, there may have been non-respondents, collection of a specific feature may of only started after a certain number of observations had already been collected, mistakes being made in data entry, or in some cases a participant may of dropped out over time \u2014 in general, there can be all kinds of reasons.", "Regardless, given a few prerequisites (i.e. we have a defined problem that we want to solve) we\u2019d want to extract meaningful insights from the data at our disposal, and that would mean confronting the problem of missing data before we begin working on our dataset. This way we avoid making any concrete conclusions on a variable that is only represented by 45% of the observations. Additionally, when it comes to training our Machine Learning algorithm, missing values may be treated as 0 or infinity by our model which can have some severe implications on the outcomes of our training.", "Note: For this task we will be using a dataset from Kaggle, specifically, the Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge. The code can be found in the link below.", "We will start by reading in the data using pd.read_csv \u2014 Documentation.", "In Pandas, a Python framework for data manipulation, missing values are represented as Nan or None, and there are multiple ways of checking whether we have any present in our data:", "Yes, I know what you\u2019re thinking, Which one should I use? Well, the biggest difference you\u2019ll find between them is that 4 are top level functions and the other 4 are methods of pandas dataframe class (pd.DataFrame.isna()). Inherently, at the dataframe level df.isna() and df.isnull() are the same likewise with df.notna() and df.notnull() (they literally have the same documentation)\u2014 this phenomena holds true for the top level functions also.", "Why have multiple methods with different names do the same thing? Pandas is built on top of NumPy which uses np.isnan() to detect missing values, ergo it has neither Na or Null values. However, Pandas uses DataFrames that are based on R DataFrames and in R Na and Null are different things \u2014 Read more about R Na andNull here and see the source of my answer here.", "So I guess in that sense we have the option to make Pandas our own, a common theme in the Pandas framework.", "I typically use df.isna() and the inverse df.notna(), mainly because it has less characters to type than df.isnull() and df.notnull(). Additionally, I prefer to have access straight to the DataFrame with dot notation, which rules out the top level functions for me (they require you to pass the DataFrame, or Series object as a parameter).", "as a sanity check, I\u2019ll do the same with pd.isna() \u2026", "Okay, It\u2019s the same (did you notice you had to type a few extra letters for the top level function route \u2014 Yes, I am lazy). Now we can check if df.notna() is truly the inverse of df.isna() \u2026", "Even though the Documentation for df.notna() states that what is returned by this method is exactly the same thing as df.isna() (I personally find it confusing), df.notna() is indeed the inverse.", "Beyond that point, let\u2019s dig further into our data to check for missing values.", "Oooops, looks like we have a Dataset that has no missing values \u2014 this is very unlikely to be the case in real-world scenarios, so we will leverage some skills that we learnt in PyTrix Series episode 4 to add some missing values \u2014 link below.", "Excellent! This means when we use the inverse method, df.notna() what should happen is that the number of missing values should be deducted from the number of rows for that specific column, right?", "To see only the rows with a specific missing observation, we can pass a conditional statement into the bracket ([]) after calling the dataframe like so\u2026", "Without going too deep into how we can deal with missing values \u2014 this may be for another post \u2014 the next few lines of code will show the easiest way (although not always the best way) to deal with missing values\u2026 drop them!", "Some of you may of noticed that when I returned the rows for which bin_4 has missing values in Figure 5, the bin_4 column returned a None values instead of NaN, don't worry if you did! Here is another example\u2026", "Remember what I said about np.nan earlier? Good. It turns out that NaN is of data type float therefore when it is used in an object data type column it converts it to None and when used on int it converts it the dtype to float, as the example code above shows.", "Pandas makes it very easy to detect missing values within DataFrames, which is important during any Data Science/Machine Learning workflow. Although we did not go through PyTrix to handle missing values, since that will be the topic of next week, you now know how to spot missing values within your DataFrames.", "Thank you very much for reaching the end of this story. If there is anything you think I have missed, something that you\u2019d like to point out to me, or if you are still unsure about something, your feedback is valuable. Send a response!
