Most of the information is presented as short and succinct bullet points. I expect this to be especially valuable to beginners or as a quick look-up for those with a basic level of experience in data science and machine learning.", "Let us get some basic terminologies out of our way first:", "Data cleaning transforms raw data into a form and format that can be effectively and efficiently processed by ML models. Despite their perceived intelligence and robustness, the GIGO principle remains valid in ML. Refer to my previous article for further details.", "Some other typical data cleaning tasks include:", "Feature engineering is more of an art than science and relies predominantly on one\u2019s domain knowledge. Done correctly, it has the potential to increase a model\u2019s predictive power.", "Feature engineering techniques for numerical data:", "Feature engineering techniques for categorical data:", "So what exactly does a Machine Learning model do? Given a set of features, X in training data, an ML model tries to iteratively find an ideal statistical function (often called the training function) that maps X to the training data\u2019s target variable, y, most accurately. Finding the ideal training function usually involves making certain assumptions about the underlying data and its form. This training function is then used to predict y on any new data in the future, given X.", "Here we will touch on some general modeling related principles and philosophies:", "Model accuracy and its interpretability tradeoff", "Better model accuracy usually results in relatively lower model interpretability.", "Complex models, like deep neural networks and ensemble decision trees, usually perform better than simpler models. However, they are much less interpretable in the sense that the training function is not easy to understand for a layperson. Simpler models, like linear regression, logistic regression, and a single decision tree, are easily interpretable at the cost of accuracy.", "Consider a simple logistic regression model. It provides us with the coefficients for each feature that, in turn, provide us with insights as to how useful that feature is for the prediction problem.", "Therefore, model selection, at times, is usually driven by the level of complexity and interpretability required. Some domains, like credit scoring, more or less mandate the use of an easily interpretable model. Hence, logistic regression has been historically and widely used in credit scoring problems. However, for image detection, recognition, and natural language processing, interpretability is less of a concern. Therefore, complex, deep neural networks can be safely deployed in these domains.", "Generally speaking, a model\u2019s bias can be improved either by parameter tuning or selecting an altogether different model, while variance can be reduced with more training data, regularization techniques, or preventing any data leakage between training and test sets. Bias and variance can be simultaneously improved only to a certain extent, beyond which an improvement in one will usually result in deterioration of another.", "This tradeoff is very common and requires a delicate balance in practice. Note that there will always be some unavoidable variance due to random noise in data, which makes it practically impossible to reduce variance to 0.", "Occam\u2019s Razor is a general philosophical principle that states: if there are two explanations for an event or a fact, then it is highly likely that the simplest explanation with the least number of assumptions will most likely be correct. When applied to ML, Occam\u2019s Razor principle implies that, when comparing two models with similar predictive power or accuracy, we should select the simpler model.", "No single machine learning model works best for all possible problems. Wolpert and Macready\u00b9 stated: \u201cIf an algorithm performs better than random search on some class of problems then it must perform worse than random search on the remaining problems\u201d. It is common to try multiple relevant models and find one that works best for your particular problem.", "Machine learning models can be classified in several ways, some of which are:", "Parametric models make strong assumptions on training data to identify and simplify the training function to a known form, the parameters of which fully describe and capture the relationships between features and the target variable.", "For example, a linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable and will try to find the best possible linear function for the same. However, if this assumption is invalid, then the model will predict poor results.", "Examples of parametric models include linear regression, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes.", "Non-Parametric models don\u2019t make strong assumptions about either the training data or the form of the training function and, thereby, are generally more flexible but at the cost of potential overfitting.", "Examples of non-parametric models include k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).", "Supervised models try to predict the known target variable(s), while unsupervised models do not have any knowledge about the target variable(s) beforehand. The goal of unsupervised learning is to try and understand the relationships between the variables or observations.", "Supervised models include linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees while unsupervised models include k-Nearest neighbors, SVM, isolation forest, and PCA", "Blackbox vs. DescriptiveBlackbox models utilize multiple complex algorithms to make decisions, but we do not know how the decision/prediction is arrived at. E.g., deep learning and neural networks.", "Descriptive models provide clear insight into why and how they make their decisions. E.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees", "Some of the widely used ML models, outside the deep machine learning domain, include:", "But how good is our model in making predictions? Model evaluation gives us the answer.", "A brief overview of the various evaluation strategies follows:", "Divide the complete dataset into two subsets, called training and test (usually in 80/20, 75/25, or 70/30 split). Train the model on the training set and apply evaluation metrics on model predictions made on the test set. This is not the ideal approach as there is no separate dataset to test, evaluate, and compare model parameters (called hyperparameter optimization) or multiple models.", "Conducting such evaluation on the test set and using the results to tune the model will result in data leakage from the test set to the training set and unreliable final evaluation metrics. This is because we are using information from the test set (that should be considered as new, unseen data that we will encounter in production) to train the model.", "Divide the complete dataset into three subsets. Train single or multiple models on the training set and apply preliminary evaluation metrics on model predictions made on the validation set. Use these results to fine-tune a single model or select the optimal model. Once a final model has been selected, apply it to the yet untouched test dataset and evaluate thereon. This prevents any data leakage and is a better, but not the ideal evaluation approach.", "CV is applied to the training set after a train/test split. CV splits the training set into multiple subsets (called folds) and fits the model on all but one sets and evaluates it on the holdout set. This would result in multiple evaluation metrics (dependent upon the number of folds), the average and standard deviation of which is used to select the final model.", "Once the final model is selected, it is trained again on the whole training set and evaluated on the test set, which was left untouched during the entire process. CV is the ideal model evaluation approach.", "Some of the standard CV techniques include:", "There are tens of model evaluation metrics out there, some of the more widely used are described below:", "Refer to my previous article for further details on these metrics.", "I hope the above pointers would come in handy in your machine learning journey.", "Feel free to reach out to me to discuss anything related to machine learning or data and financial analytics.", "Your home for data science.
