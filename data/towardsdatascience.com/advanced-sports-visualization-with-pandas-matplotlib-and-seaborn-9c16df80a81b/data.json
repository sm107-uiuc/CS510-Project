Instead, I will introduce some visualization techniques that will help us prepare eye-catching and insightful graphs to woo your fellow sport enthusiasts.", "Bad news: this is usually the hardest part", "While you may have no trouble collecting summary statistics of a sport events (goals in a football match, throws in a basketball game, etc.), it is usually a lot harder find a detailed, play-by-play dataset of a particular football game or a tennis match. Tracking players on the field, especially for high-tempo, high intensity sports such as football or basketball is a formidable task, albeit a very lucrative one. Companies such as SportVu or Opta Sports monetize by selling these highly sought-after information to teams, sport consultancies or research centers.", "\u201cFor every match we have three guys using[\u2026] a live video feed on a pitch graphic: one guy watches the home team, another does the away team and the third man is essentially a data checker\u201d", "\u2014 Simon Banoub, Opta\u2019s director of Marketing", "Recently, Statsbomb announced the public release of the play-by-play, second-accurate datasets of every single game across the three recent football leagues: the National Women Soccer League (US), the FA Women\u2019s Super League (England), and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. You can get access to their datasets for free here.", "The datasets are all in json format, so you will need to parse the raw dataset to a relational format that can be easily retrieved and manipulated.", "json_normalize() is a very convenient tools as it can automatically \u201cnormalize\u201d json structure into a flat relational structure.", "In this tutorial, we will focus exclusively in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I encourage you to read the documentation of the dataset before diving in with the analysis. After all, understanding your data is paramount.", "At first, let us use Matplotlib to draw a simple football pitch.", "That seems a lot, but let\u2019s unpack the draw_pitch() function line by line. The function takes in an ax argument, which is the output of the add_subplot() function in Matplotlib. It then adds several objects with pre-defined dimension to recreate an image of a football pitch, including the center circle, the penalty areas, the 6-yard boxes, and the arcs in the pitch. Once we have defined this function, we call in together with standard Matplotlib figure function as follows:", "What is the most shocking moment of the 2018 FIFA World Cup?", "There are many contenders but few would beat the moment when then-defending champion Germany crashed out of the World Cup after defeat by South Korea. There were pains, there were tears, and surely, there were criticism. The aftermath of the sobering defeat saw the departure of German\u2019s number 10, Mesut \u00d6zil, who bore almost the entire blame, both for his performances and his meeting with Turkish president Erdo\u011fan right before the World Cup. Just listen to what Bayern Munich\u2019s president Uli Hoeness had to say about \u00d6zil:", "\u201cHe had been playing s*** for years[\u2026] And now he and his s*** performance hide beyond this picture.\u201d", "But, was he even that bad?", "Let\u2019s look at his performance during the widely criticized match against South Korea. I want to plot a heat map and a pass map to capture his performances during the 90 minutes and to evaluate the influence (whether positive or negative) he exerted on the German\u2019s offensive side.", "Let\u2019s start with a Pass Map", "We load the json file and do some basic data cleaning in Panda to get a dataset that only contains Passing Events by Mesut \u00d6zil.", "This dataset is extremely meaningful, i.e., one can find out that Ozil attempted as many as 95 passes with up to 7 incisive ones in the match, which was pretty impressive for an attacking midfielder, or he relayed the ball the most to Toni Kroos (19 times) and Marco Reus (18 times) during the game. For the purpose of the pass map, we only care about the starting and ending location of a pass", "The code below allows us to overlay the passes as arrows onto our pitch", "Tracking active zone with a heat map", "Football heatmaps are used by in-club and media analysts to illustrate the area within which a player has been present. They are effectively a smoothed out scatter plot of player locations and could be a good indicator of how effective a player is at different parts of the field. While there may be some debate as to how much they are useful (they don\u2019t tell you if actions/movement are a good or bad thing!), they can often be very aesthetically pleasing and engaging, hence their popularity.", "Now if we go back to Mesut \u00d6zil, one of the main criticisms he faces is the low amount of field coverage as we rarely see him launching in tackles or fighting for possession, thus, \u201clow level of work rate\u201d as they say.", "But is that really the case?", "Let\u2019s plot a heat map using Seaborn on top of Matplotlib to visualize Mesut Ozil\u2019s involvement during 90-minute of the Germany-Korea match. The syntax of the code is incredibly simple. We use a kdeplot, which will draw a kernel density estimate of the scattering points of \u00d6zil\u2019s locations.", "Wow!!! That looks very\u2026 anti-climatic. After all, what is the graph trying to tell you? I see some coordinates, and clearly these contour-looking plots does seem to indicate that \u00d6zil is more active in the area with darker color.", "Can we do any better than that?", "Yes, the answer is that we can combine (1) the pitch, (2) the pass map and (3) the heat map in order to have a more comprehensive views of Ozil\u2019s performance during the game", "Now we can see a more comprehensive picture of Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s performance during the game. A couple of observations right off the bat:", "What I found interesting was the heat-pass map of Timo Werner, who started out as the lone striker for the Germany team then paired up with Mario Gomez for much of the second half.", "He surprisingly spent a lot of his time on the two sides, while you would expect the Central Forward to occupy the space in the 18-yard box a lot more. This partly explains the ineffectiveness of German offensive line during the game, as their forward lines (Werner, Reus, Goretzka and then Muller, G\u00f3mez) crowd up at the wings but fail to take up space in the penalty area, thus providing very little outlet for playmakers such as \u00d6zil and Kroos to direct the ball into the 18-yard box.", "A friend of mine was very convinced that the key to France\u2019s successful World Cup was their relentless attempts to break down defending lines with long-range efforts. Think about that stunning goal Benjamin Pavard scored against Argentina in the Quarter Final", "We can again attempt to visualize all shots from the France team to decide whether the majority of their goals come from outside or inside the box?", "If I just follow the methods shown thus far, this is what I get", "This is fine. But we can do more to make the visualization more engaging and insightful. Specifically, I made two small tweaks:", "(1) Since we only focus on the shots, which are all recorded at one side of the pitch, I will draw only the right half of the pitch", "(2) Since we only care about the starting points of the shots, we can toss away the arrows and only visualize shots as scatter plots where x, y are location at which the shot were attempted.", "Now this looks a whole lot better. We can see right away that France attempted as many shot inside the boxes as they did outside the penalty area. Although to a certain extent, it does support the argument that France did take a lot more long-range efforts than usual, as we would expect a much lower density of shots outside the box. In any case, it does look interesting how they seems equally clinical with the short and long-range efforts.", "In my Jupyter notebook, you can also find further techniques such as overlaying a density plot and including an image to your visualization. With a couple more lines of code, you can easily produce this visualization:", "You can find all the source code for this tutorial here", "The data used for this project was released by Statsbomb and available to the public here", "Your home for data science.
