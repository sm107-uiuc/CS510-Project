Try running it yourself and messing with parameters.", "Modeling the spread of a novel virus and its resulting disease is an important step in learning proper preventive measures. So far there have been many new simulations that have been created to cover different areas of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. For example, the Washington Post made a great article showing the importance of social distancing. With this article, I try my hand at simulating this disease and through this I hope to spread the importance of safety precautions.", "Cellular Automata are discrete models that consist of a grid of cells where each cell can be a certain state from a given set of states. Every time step each cell is updated to a new state based on its neighbors\u2019 states and simple rules. They have been used to model different areas from artificial life to forest fire propagation. Conway\u2019s Game of Life is a popular cellular automation that creates complex structures with very simple rules.", "An important aspect of cellular automata is the use of localization. Since cells update based on their neighbors (usually in the 8 surrounding cells) any problem based on interactions between close-by entities can be effectively modeled by cellular automata. This fits perfectly for modeling infections as they tend to occur through water droplets from nearby people coughing or sneezing.", "Here are a few important equations used to analyze viruses:", "Secondary Attack Rate (SAR): The ratio of overall number of infected people to total number of susceptible people (calculated at end of simulation)", "Basic Reproductive Number (R0): the number of susceptibles an infected person directly transmits the virus to over their whole infectious lifetime", "The simulation environment consists of people in a closed space (one side wraps i.e teleports people to the other side). An individual can either be susceptible, infected or recovered. This follows the basic SIR model of epidemics. Initially, the world is filled with people who are either infected or susceptible and then over time based on the safety measures in-place the infection rate will explode or the virus will die out rather quickly. However, no new people spawn and no people can leave unless they die from the disease.", "Individuals in the environment move around to simulate interactions. Individuals practicing social distancing (circles in the above gif) tend to move around defensively to avoid standing too close to others. While individuals that do not practice social distancing (squares) move around without bothering to distance themselves from possibly infectious people. Take a look at the above gif that represents the environment. Notice that the circles tend to be spaced out from everyone else. The only time this isn\u2019t the case is if they are surrounded and have no where to go or a square walks up next to it. Later, we will explore how important social distancing is.", "When a susceptible individual gets infected they do not immediately become symptomatic nor infectious. Rather the infection follows a timeline in the person:", "On the top side or the infectious side, first the virus is latent which means that the person is not immediately infectious. Then a few days later in the case of COVID-19 they become infectious. Finally, even before symptoms have fully ceased they enter the removed phase which means they are once again not infectious. On the bottom or symptomatic side, first they are in the incubation period meaning they do not show symptoms, then they become symptomatic (or asymptomatic meaning they never show symptoms which can be dangerous for others). Lastly, symptoms can progress from mild to severe and then possibly to death. However, most will just experience mild symptoms. The simulation includes this important timeline which is accurate to current COVID-19 findings.", "A popular model of infection is the Kermack-McKendrick model. It is useful for calculating the number of infected people in a closed population over time. It is a series of differential equations describing infections, however in this case a non-differential derivation is used to describe the probability a susceptible is infected given the number of infected around it.", "Wearing a mask has been shown to limit the spread of infectious droplets. In other words, an infectious person who wears a mask has a lower chance of spreading the virus to a susceptible in the vicinity. So in the above equation p is not the same for all infectious individuals, it will be lower for those wearing a mask.", "Before we get into running the simulation we need to know what we are going to analyze. Even after numerous studies and reports people still debate the effectiveness of wearing a mask or social distancing. In addition, some states have been much more lenient than others over safety, and haven\u2019t mandated masks as often or were slow to enforce social distancing. So lets take a look at varying levels of safety policies by assigning probabilities to people wearing a mask and social distancing to see how effective these techniques are.", "One of the most important steps to accurately modeling COVID-19 and not just any generic infectious disease is getting the probabilities correct. Many values don\u2019t have one agreed upon answer so I stuck to trustworthy sources such as the CDC and more recent research papers. Some important values such as base probability of infection and the decrease in infection probability given wearing a mask do not exist. However, I based these values off of reasonable ranges and adjusted them so the simulated virus had the same R0 as COVID-19.", "Each person initially has a 10% chance of social distancing and a 10% chance of wearing a mask.", "The plot clearly shows that people who practice social distancing are much less likely to get infected.", "Those that wear a mask, social distance or do both almost always infect fewer people than those not taking these safety precautions.", "Each person initially has a 25% chance of social distancing and a 25% chance of wearing a mask.", "Like the very unsafe policy, those who social distance are much less likely to get infected than those who don\u2019t.", "Same as above, those who take safety precautions contribute to fewer infections of others.", "Each person initially has a 50% chance of social distancing and a 50% chance of wearing a mask.", "This follows the trends above, but the lines are closer which can be explained by generally fewer infected people because of the overall safety.", "This R0 plot is hard to read, and the lines tend to criss-cross more. However, for the majority of the timesteps (especially between 20 and 35) people taking safety precautions infect fewer people. Because there aren\u2019t too many infected people different runs of the simulation can cause very different looking R0 plots. Try it out yourself with the accompanying code.", "A good way to compare the effectiveness of different safety policies is to just look at the ratio of infected to total susceptibles at the end of the simulation i.e SAR.", "The SAR of low safety is almost 4 times as large as high safety. Lets compare even more calculations of safety policies to drill this in.", "Once again, the more unsafe i.e little social distancing and wearing a mask the more infections and therefore deaths (not shown). Note: the drop at timestep 14 occurs because those who were initially infected recovered (if they didn't die).", "The R0 plot isn\u2019t as clean cut as infections or SAR but for the majority of the time the safe policy attributes to fewer lifetime infections. Only at timestep 40 does it go higher than the less safe policies. Try running the simulations yourself and see what the plots look like.", "Social Distancing vs Wearing a mask?", "Precursor to this section: Do both! However, I just wanted to see which tended to be more effective for keeping down this simulation\u2019s number of infected.", "From this crosstab it is obvious that social distancing and wearing a mask means lower SAR i.e fewer infected. It also shows that social distancing is very important because there is a huge difference between SARs for different levels of social distancing. Wearing a mask also has an effect but its not as pronounced. However, a little goes a long way and there is still a 28% decrease in the SAR from 10% WM to 50% WM.", "Through this simple simulation of an epidemic (using COVID-19 statistics) with cellular automation we can see just how important taking safety precautions is, such as social distancing and wearing a mask. Please do these things and help slow the infection rate of COVID-19.", "Side note: There are a lot more things that could be added to this simulation such as age effects, hospitalization, testing and self-isolation.
