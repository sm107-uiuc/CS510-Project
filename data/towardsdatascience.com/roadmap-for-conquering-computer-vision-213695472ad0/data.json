I have had a hard time finding any such roadmap and to-do list for computer vision. As a vision enthusiast and consultant, I have found a lot of people asking about a concrete roadmap (in terms of skills, courses etc) to grasp computer vision. The following blog tries to serve this purpose.", "It should be noted that it would be a long and effort-oriented roadmap. I personally don\u2019t encourage people to take shortcuts in studying a hardcore field. I believe that following the mentioned roadmap, you would be on the right track in doing a lot of rigor vision work with the proper understanding of stuff. Excited enough? Never mind!", "Computer vision is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which aims to make machines intelligent enough to understand images. As Machine learning (and deep learning) is one of the most active subsets of AI on the planet nowadays, it would be appropriate and sensible to tackle computer vision in a Machine learning framework. To understand the full essence of my to-be-suggested roadmap, it\u2019s important to consider a general machine learning process.", "Note: Following part is a bit technical. People who just want to get started with the roadmap should skip this and read the Recipe section", "Every machine learning system can be decomposed into the following two sub-systems:", "A learning algorithm essentially requires n-dimensional feature space to draw a decision boundary (in classification paradigm) or to fit a hyperplane (in terms of linear regression). To convert raw data into feature space, we usually require two important things :", "Domain knowledge tells us about the important factors to look into the data for our business decision (consider a doctor telling you to look for a circle in MRI to detect tumor). Data processing knowledge then encodes those factors (from domain knowledge) to feature space from Data processing knowledge (considering detection of a circle from MRI using Image processing).", "Data processing is essential to extract out important features from raw data. If raw data is in the form of images, Image processing is the Data processing knowledge that we need. If data is textual, we need to have linguistic and text mining knowledge to extract features. Every single type of data has it\u2019s corresponding processing knowledge.", "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which has its technical roots. Without going into the technicalities behind deep learning, it should be understood that deep learning enables us to get rid of the Feature Extraction step. We just have a learning algorithm to do all things. These deep learning algorithms can directly work on raw data space. All of the present AI hype is due to deep learning.", "As we have two different learning paradigms, we can learn and apply computer vision in two different forms. Computer vision backed by traditional machine learning algorithms is referred to as classical computer vision. If computer vision is based on deep learning, it is referred to as Modern computer vision.", "As with any machine learning system, classical computer vision is also composed of two major sub systems :", "So folks, mastering computer vision is significantly related to understanding the aforementioned two things. I am listing out some of the courses for Image processing and computer vision to get started :", "Modern computer vision systems are basically built upon deep learning. It has given us the flexibility that we can do much of the vision tasks without having the knowledge of classical image processing. To take this approach, try doing the following courses :", "I strongly recommend the readers to at least have some sense of classical computer vision before diving deep into modern computer vision. This will help a lot in the future.", "The listed outline would enable you guys to begin your ever-learning journey of computer vision. It is definitely time-consuming. It would definitely take a lot of effort but that\u2019s what is essentially required. I want everyone to be aware of why s/he is applying certain algorithms. This roadmap would also help you to design and build customized solutions to new problems.", "I have devoted half of this blog describing a general machine learning process. You can generalize the same road map for every other sub field of AI including Natural Language Processing, Speech recognition etc.", "Your home for data science.
