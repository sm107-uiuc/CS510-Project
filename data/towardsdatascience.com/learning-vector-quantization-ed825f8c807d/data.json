However, when it comes to ML algorithms there is a lot more under the sun than just neural networks. In fact, during university, most of the ML projects I\u2019ve done did not use neural networks at all. But why would one ever use anything else but neural networks? It is true that neural networks can achieve amazing results to very complex problems. There are some key issues, though. They require big datasets and a lot of computational power, especially the latter isn\u2019t always within one\u2019s reach. And often it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to use something as complex as a neural network for rather small and simple problems, where other algorithms are faster and potentially better!", "Learning vector quantization (LVQ) is one such algorithm that I have used a lot. While the algorithm itself is not particularly powerful when compared to some others, it is surprisingly simple and intuitive. Additionally, it has some extensions that can make the algorithm a powerful tool in a variety of ML related tasks.", "LVQ is a so-called prototype-based learning method. One or more prototypes are used to represent each class in the dataset, each prototype is described as a point in the feature space. New (unknown) datapoints are then assigned the class of the prototype that is nearest to them. In order for \u201cnearest\u201d to make sense, a distance measure has to be defined. You are free to pick any distance metric, usually, Euclidean distance is the distance measure of choice. There is no limitation on how many prototypes can be used per class, the only requirement being that there is at least 1 for each class. The image below displays a simple LVQ system where each class (red and blue) is represented by one prototype (the bigger dots).", "So how do we fit prototypes to each class such that they are a good representation of that class? We start by picking a distance metric, in this example we will apply the Euclidian distance metric.", "Recall that the Euclidean distance between 2 vectors in N dimensions is given by:", "Notice that we can use the squared Euclidean distance, which does not require us to compute the square root.", "The first step is to initialise each prototype, usually the prototypes are initialised by using the class means.", "The next step is to go through the dataset, one feature vector at a time. For every such feature vector we need to compute the distance to every prototype using the chosen distance measure. Then we do an update step to the closest prototype only. If the prototype has the same label as the feature vector, it is pushed towards the feature vector, otherwise it is pushed away from it in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the push is determined by the learning rate, which is one of the parameters of the algorithm.", "Once we have done this for every sample in our dataset, we can repeat this process numerous times, until the algorithm converges. One sweep through the dataset is also called a training epoch. The algorithm usually needs a few epochs to reach convergence, depending on the complexity of the problem.", "The code below is an implementation of the LVQ algorithm in Python.", "Feel free to experiment with a dataset of your choice. You could also impove the algorithm, for instance by allowing for multiple prototypes to be used per class.", "Now that we have the algorithm down, let\u2019s test it on some sample data. In this case I used the Banknote authentication data set from the UCI Machine Learning repository.", "Before running the algorithm on the sample dataset, I shuffled the feature vectors and set aside 10 % of the set as validation set. Now what should you do with the learning rate parameter? Ideally, you should use cross validation in order to figure out the best value. In this case I simply picked 0.01 as learning rate as it gave decent results. After 25 epochs the algorithm converged to an error of 0.28 on the validation set. Which is not all that bad for an algorithm that is so intuitive and simple.", "In order to classify a new unknown feature vector, simply assign to it the class of the closest prototype.", "LVQ has some clear advantages: it is simple, intuitive, and easy to implement while still yielding decent performance. However, in more complex problems the Euclidean distance can cause problems if the data has a lot of dimensions or is noisy. Proper normalization and pre-processing of the feature space is necessary. But even then, if your data has many dimensions, you might suffer from the curse of dimensionality and you might consider some form of dimensionality reduction.", "That\u2019s all for now folks! Next time, we will look at more sophisticated variations of the algorithm that deal with some of the problems of LVQ.", "Your home for data science.
