However, one of the main challenges with a growing user base is the large amount of data generated, often in the form of natural language. This data can be driven from customer feedback or even on social media platforms where customers express their thoughts and opinion towards their experiences using your service or products.", "The real challenge is to automatically parse and organise this data into a more digestible and actionable insight. One of the most popular natural language processing techniques to apply on such data is Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis aims to automatically extract and classify sentiments (the subjective part of an opinion) and/or emotions (the projections or display of a feeling) expressed in text.", "An opinion may be defined as a combination of four factors (entity, holder, claim, and sentiment), in which the opinion holder may believe a claim about an entity, and in many cases, associate a sentiment with that belief. As opposed to extracting the general sentiment expressed in a piece of text, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis aims to extract both the entity described in the text (in this case, attributes or components of a product or service) and the sentiment expressed towards such entities.", "The advantages gained from exploring how your customers are reacting towards particular parts of your service or product can help support business use cases, including product development and quality control, communications, customer support, and decision making processes. In this case, this post investigates combining traditional topic modelling techniques with sentiment analysis to extract text aspects, as well as the sentiment expressed towards them.", "The dataset used in this post is by Julian McAuley. It contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning between May 1996 \u2014 July 2014. This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs). Here, we\u2019ll use reviews for cell phones and accessories. The total number of reviews in this dataset is 194,439.", "We\u2019ll follow the standard set of pre-processing techniques used in several natural language processing tasks. Such techniques include:", "Before we look into applying topic modelling techniques, the last pre-processing step is to vectorise the reviews, i.e. we need to represent the data into a numerical form so that the model can handle them. There are several representations you can use, with the popular methods being the word\u2019s TF-IDF score or their frequency counts (bag-of-words approach). Here, we\u2019ll stick to a bag-of-words representation. We\u2019ll use the CounterVectorizer function from Sklearn\u2019s feature extraction module. This function converts a collection of text to a matrix of word counts.", "Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning approach used to distribute texts into groups which best characterise such documents. This concept can also be used to extract text aspects.", "Sklearn includes a version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. For this concept, we want to extract five aspects. Once the parameters are set, we can fit the LDA to the vectorised version of the text.", "To make the output easier to read, we can append the relevance score produced for each topic to each review as a column and calculate the dominant topic by taking the topic with the highest relevance score.", "Now we can see which topic (by its number) a review belongs to. But what keywords, in this case text aspects, has the LDA extracted from such reviews? We can view them by calling the vectoriser\u2019s get_feature_names() and see their relevance score to that aspect using the LDA\u2019s components_functions:", "We determine which aspect a keyword belongs to by taking its highest relevance score across the five aspects. Then, for each aspect, we can order our dataframe in descending order and select the keywords with the highest score.", "Various techniques and methodologies have been developed to address automatically identifying the sentiment expressed in the text. In this post, I\u2019ll use VADER, a Python sentiment analysis library, to classify whether the reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.", "A very simple approach to sentiment analysis is by using a list of words which have been labelled according to their semantic orientation. For example, we can assume that the word \u201cgood\u201d has a positive valence, whereas the word \u201cbad\u201d has a negative one. VADER uses this technique and provides a percentage score which represents the proportion of lyrics which fall in each sentiment category. It also provides a compound score which is computed by summing the valence scores of each word and then normalising the scores to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).", "What\u2019s nice about VADER is the fact that we don\u2019t have to pre-process the text in any way. We can feed the raw product reviews into VADER\u2019s sentiment function and retrieve the compound scores for each.", "First, we\u2019ll import the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer function from VADER\u2019s Python library. I\u2019ll initialise the sentiment analyser from VADER, and then iterate over the reviews from the dataframe. I\u2019ll then calculate whether the compound sentiment score is above or beneath the thresholds so that we can assign them with the positive, negative, or neutral label.", "Once we\u2019ve retrieved the compound scores for each review, we can plot and count the number of positive, negative, and neutral reviews for each of the five aspects.", "This chart reports that the majority of the reviews for each aspect are positive. In particular, with more than 83,000 reviews, the screen protector received 49,572 positive ones. For a business, having more than 50% of your reviews expressing a positive sentiment is a good indication that your customers are satisfied with the product.", "What other potential insights can we gather? Let\u2019s dive deeper into what the customers are saying. For this concept, we\u2019ll use the reviews for the screen protector.", "One of the main features used to support Sentiment Analysis include individual sentiment words (e.g. good, bad) which explicitly convey a subjective bias. Sentiment words are available from specialised dictionaries, where they have been mapped to their sentiment.", "These words are often adjectives (e.g. good, bad), adverbs (e.g. cheerfully, weirdly), nouns (e.g. blessing, rubbish), and verbs (e.g. love, hate). Sentiment may also be expressed by using comparative words (e.g. better, worse). To identify those adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs in text, we can apply Part of Speech (POS) tagging. POS tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, or determiner), based on both its definition and its context.", "Here, we use the NLTK POS tagger to identify the POS tags. As we\u2019ve got quite a large dataset, we want to automatically narrow down the sentiment words as much as possible. In this case, we\u2019re able to identify English and correctly spelt words and map them to SentiWordNet, a lexical resource for opinion mining. SentiWordNet assigns words three sentiment scores: positivity, negativity, and objectivity.", "Objectivity can be defined as not being influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts. Subjectivity is therefore the contrast of objectivity. In terms of scoring, we want to identify words with low objectivity score. But not all subjective words are sentiment words.", "To capture sentiment words from subjective ones, we use WordNet-Affect, another lexical resource which represents affective concepts correlated with affective words in a hierarchical structure. Once we\u2019ve checked whether the subjective words are in WordNet-Affect, we can be quite confident that these are sentiment words. Based on their SentiWordNet positive and negative score, we can also split them up into separate collections and count how many times they appear across the whole dataset.", "We\u2019ll illustrate the results in a word cloud, a simple visualisation of data in which words are shown in varying sizes depending on how often they appear in your data. The size of a word shows how often it appears in a review.", "Based on both word clouds, it\u2019s quite clear that the most common positive and negative sentiment words used in the reviews are happy and worry respectively. For a business, again, having happy as the most popular positive sentiment word is reassuring!", "\u201cI love this case! It\u2019s so pretty. And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy!\u201d", "But the negative sentiment words might be concerning. After scanning over the reviews which contain the word worry, we can note that the majority of their occurrences are after the negations \u2018didn\u2019t worry\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019. Negation plays an important role in sentiment analysis as it can revert the polarity of sentiment words. Negation words such as \u2018not\u2019 or \u2018never\u2019 are often considered stop words, which were removed during pre-processing and their effect on the polarity of sentiment words. This is an important future note to consider.", "The following review illustrates an the example where hate, the second most popular negative sentiment word across the reviews, is present:", "\u201cI hate screen protectors. HATE them, and thus rarely use them. They\u2019re either a pain in the ass to install, make the display look like crap, or a combination of both.\u201d", "Guess this person dislikes screen protectors\u2026", "So, what have I learnt from this analysis?", "Traditional topic modelling techniques can be used to successfully extract aspects from text. Like many data science problems, one of the core tasks of the problem is the pre-processing of the data. This has particular effects on sentiment analysis results, where removing specific stop words may impact the identification of negation and therefore the true sentiment expressed.", "For the full notebook, check out my GitHub repo below:", "If you\u2019re interested in more topic modelling posts, I recently wrote about determining more meaningful titles to a given topic.
