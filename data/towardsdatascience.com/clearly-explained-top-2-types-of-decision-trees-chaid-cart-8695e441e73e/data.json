Unlike linear models, they map non-linear relationships quite well. They are adaptable at solving any kind of problem at hand (classification or regression).", "CHAID and CART are the two oldest types of Decision trees. They are also the most common types of Decision trees used in the industry today as they are super easy to understand while being quite different from each other. In this post, we\u2019ll learn about all the fundamental information required to understand these two types of decision trees.", "Let\u2019s dive in to understand the CHAID Decision tree algorithm first.", "This algorithm was originally proposed by Kass in 1980. As is evident from the name of this algorithm, it is based on the chi-square statistic. A Chi-square test yields a probability value as a result lying anywhere between 0 and 1. A chi-square value closer to 0 indicates that there is a significant difference between the two classes which are being compared. Similarly, a value closer to 1 indicates that there is not any significant difference between the 2 classes.", "Variable types used in CHAID algorithm:", "Variable to be predicted i.e Dependent variable: Continuous OR Categorical", "Independent variables: Categorical ONLY (can be more than 2 categories)", "Thus, if there are continuous predictor variables, then we need to transform them into categorical variables before they can be supplied to the CHAID algorithm.", "Statistical Tests used to determine the next best split:", "Continuous Dependent Variable: F-Test (Regression Problems)", "Let\u2019s understand Bonferroni Adjustment/Correction before we progress further.", "In statistics, the Bonferroni correction is one of several methods used to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons.", "This adjustment tackles with the fact that the more tests you perform, the greater the risk of Type 1 error (False Positive) i.e. it appears as if you have stumbled upon something significant, but in reality, you haven\u2019t.", "The above image indicates that if we take an alpha value of 0.05 and we conduct 1 test, then we have a 95% confidence level indicating that there is a 95% probability that we\u2019ll be able to avoid Type 1 error. Now, observe that as we start increasing the number of tests to 100, we are left with only 0.^% probability to be able to avoid Type 1 error. To counter this effect, we calculate the adjusted alpha value in tandem with the number of tests. Now, as long as we can use this new adjusted value of alpha, we can be in a safe zone theoretically.", "Observe the adjusted alpha value at 100 tests, it has become so low that the tree will stop growing because it\u2019ll not be able to find any variables that can achieve that level of super-significance.", "Generally, all the software to develop decision trees gives an option to the modeler to turn it off. Bonferroni adjustment setting should be left on. If in case we turn it off in case of a scenario where the tree is not growing and we would like to experiment by turning Bonferroni off, then consider making the alpha value lower than the usual 0.05 to be careful of the Type 1 error possibility that we discussed above.", "Also, always, always validate your tree once the modeling stage has been completed.", "Nominal Variable: Automatically groups the data as per point # 2 above", "Ordinal Variable: Automatically groups the data as per point # 2 above", "Continuous Variable: Converts into segments/deciles before performing #2", "The nature of the CHAID algorithm is to create WIDE trees.", "We can proceed now to understand CART decision trees algorithm", "This algorithm was introduced to the world by Breiman et al. in 1984.", "This algorithm works on twin pillars of \u201cPurity\u201d and \u201cBalance\u201d. Purity is indicated by Gini as explained above and balance is indicated by the same population distribution among the left and the right partitions of the decision tree.

There are a lot of pros and cons lists available to draw a comparison between CART and CHAID but I believe that each suits a different purpose. You have to work around and play with your data and experiment a lot with a variety of methods to actually get the hang of what is good for a particular business problem that you are trying to solve.", "I\u2019ll rather list here the common advantages and disadvantages of Decision trees as the concluding section:", "In my next post, I\u2019ll address QUEST and C5 algorithms as an extension to this guide for understanding what actually goes on around inside a Decision tree algorithm.", "Keep watching this space for more on Data Science, Machine learning, and Statistics!", "Your home for data science.
