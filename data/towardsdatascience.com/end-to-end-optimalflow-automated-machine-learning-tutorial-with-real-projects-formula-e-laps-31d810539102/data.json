You could read another story of its introduction: \u201cAn Omni-ensemble Automated Machine Learning \u2014 OptimalFlow\u201d.", "Set up your working environment with Python 3.7+, and install OptimalFlow by Pip command. Currently, the most recent version is 0.1.7. More package\u2019s information could be found at PyPI.", "After data preparation in Part 1 of this tutorial, most of the features are ready to feed the modeling process. Missing values in category features are not welcomed when the data flow comes to autoPP(OptimalFlow\u2019s auto feature preprocessing module). So we need to double-check the cleaned data and apply data cleaning to the features with missing values. For this problem, I only found \u2018GROUP\u2019 feature has missing value and using the following code to convert it.", "OptimalFlow provides open interfaces for users to do custom settings in every module. Even in the autoCV (OptimalFlow\u2019s model selection & evaluation module), you could custom set specific models or hyperparameters searching space. You could find more details in the Documentation.", "As the code below, we set up scalers and encoders algorithm for autoPP (OptimalFlow\u2019s auto feature preprocessing module); selectors for autoFS (OptimalFlow\u2019s auto feature selection module); estimators for autoCV module.", "For the features selection and model selection w/ evaluation, we set up selectors and estimators searching space.", "PLEASE NOTE: The \u201csparsity\u201d and \u201ccols\u201d are 2 limitations you could set to narrow down the number of dataset combinations. Usually, when the sparsity of a dataset is too low, the variance within the features will be low, which means the information value will be low. You could try different values settings in these 2 parameters, based on your acceptable number of datasets, which will go through the Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments(PCTE) process to find the optimal model with its pipeline workflow. Of course, the larger number of datasets combination generated from autoPP module, the more time needs for further processes in OptimalFlow automated machine learning. Vice versa, when there\u2019s no dataset combination can meet the sparsity and columns number\u2019s restrictions, the following process cannot continue. So, be careful and try some values with these settings.", "The core concept/improvement in OptimalFlow is Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments(PCTE), which is a theory of framework first proposed by Tony Dong in Genpact 2020 GVector Conference, to optimize and automate Machine Learning Workflow using ensemble pipelines algorithm.", "Comparing other automated or classic machine learning workflow\u2019s repetitive experiments using a single pipeline, Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments is more powerful, since it expends the workflow from 1 dimension to 2 dimensions by ensemble all possible pipelines(Pipeline Cluster) and automated experiments. With larger coverage scope, to find the best model without manual intervention, and also more flexible with elasticity to cope with unseen data due to its ensemble designs in each component, the Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments provide data scientists an alternative more convenient and \u201cOmni-automated\u201d machine learning approach.", "To implement PCTE process, OptimalFlow provides autoPipe module to achieve that.

OptimalFlow should finish all of these tasks automatedly.", "The outputs of the Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments (PCTE) process includes information of preprocessing algorithms applied to prepared dataset combinations(DICT_PREP_INFO), selected top features for each dataset combination(DICT_FEATURE_SELECTION_INFO), models evaluation results(DICT_MODELS_EVALUATION), split dataset combination(DICT_DATA), model selection results ranking table(models_summary).", "This is a useful function for data scientists, since retrieving the previous machine learning workflow is painful when they want to reuse the previous outputs.", "Since the PCTE process will last very long when there is a large number of datasets combination as the input, we\u2019d better save the outputs of the previous step(pipeline cluster with optimal models) as pickles for results interpretation and visualization steps.", "Next step we will see our modeling results by import the saved pickles in the previous step. We can use the following code to find the top 3 models with their optimal flow after PCTE automated process:", "It\u2019s very clear, the KNN algorithm with tuned hyperparameters performance the best.
