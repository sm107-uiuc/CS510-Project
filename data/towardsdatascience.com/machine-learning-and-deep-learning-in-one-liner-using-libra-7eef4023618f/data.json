These frameworks have made it easier for users to create machine learning models easily. But still one needs to follow the whole procedure that includes Data preparation, Modelling, Evaluation. Data preparation contains data cleaning and pre-processing. Modeling takes in the pre-processed data and uses algorithms to predict the result. Evaluation gives us a measure of how well our algorithm is performing. Due to these libraries and frameworks, our time to write everything is reduced but still, we need to write a handful amount of code.", "\u201cMachine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.\u201d -Nick Bostrom", "The advancements in this field are increasing day by day with the help of amazing open source communities which gave rise to the existing frameworks. Think about a framework that does all of the above-mentioned processes in a single line. Yes, you read it right, now you can also do that. Libra is a framework that does that work for you in a single line. It\u2019s also easy to use even for a non-technical person. Libra requires the least average number of lines to train the model.", "In this blog, I will give complete guidance on how to use Libra. I will be taking different datasets for a different problem and will show you step by step approach.", "I have used the Kaggle dataset for the prediction of credit card fraud. The data has already gone through the principal component analysis, so it is now reduced to less dimensional data as compared to the original one. It requires following a systematic approach while solving this problem. In the General way, you will follow the sequence mentioned in the first paragraph. But with Libra, you don\u2019t have to worry about it.", "Most of the transactions in this data are Non-Fraudulent (99.83 Percent) of the time, while Fraudulent transactions occur (0.17 percent) of the time in the dataset. Which means that the data is highly imbalanced. Let us see how well Libra preprocess the data and gives us the result.", "Everything is built around the client object. You can call different queries on it and everything will be stored under the models field of the object.", "We pass the location of our file in the client object and name it as newClient. Now to access various queries refer to the documentation. I am using a decision tree here. Instruction in the English language is a statement that represents the task you would like to complete. For example, predict the median house value, or please estimate the number of households. Else the instruction should correspond to a column in the dataset. Libra Automatically detects the target column but just to be sure that it select the right column, I have passed the target column name.", "With just two lines of code, we acquired a score of approximately 0.99, which is the best we can get. If you check out other kernels, you would observe that only a handful of people got 0.99 accuracies, and that took them hours to preprocess the data and write code for it. In that case, libra saves you a lot of time and gives you the best result. Libra uses something known as Intelligent preprocessing so that you don\u2019t need to preprocess the data, all by yourself.", "newClient.analyze() Creates confusion matrix and ROC Curve for all classification problems. It Also calculates recall, precision, f1, and f2 score.", "newClient.info() returns all the keys, representing each category of data generated for the dataset.", "newClient.model() returns a dictionary of that model. It includes everything from accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score to all the preprocessing techniques. It\u2019s more helpful for people who already know about these concepts and can code them.

Data will be automatically augmented through zoom, shear, flip, and rescaling. Then the optimal image size will be chosen. You will also notice the number of images in each class and the number of classes associated with it. Finally, you will also observe the training accuracy and testing accuracy.", "You can also pass read_mode hyper-parameter inside convolutional_query, in which you can specify the read mode.

For this, I am using a private dataset that predicts behavior from the brain signals. Let\u2019s check it how well does it perform on that dataset.", "From the above code, you can notice that the initial number of layers that the model used is 3. Then it also tests the accuracy with a different number of layers that vary according to the performance of the former layer. It predicts the best number of layers found and it\u2019s training and testing accuracy.

This framework gives us an overview of how fast the field of Data Science is evolving and also gives us a glimpse of the type of changes that can be there in this field.
