Companies use BI to detect significant events like gaining insights into customer behavior, monitoring key performance indicators over time and gaining market and sales intelligence to adapt quickly to their changing and dynamic business.", "BI forms the backbone of all reporting projects especially after the industry decided to shift from a siloed way of working to creating a single source of truth for all business units. 70% of the work revolves around data manipulation and reporting, that is why Data Scientists, Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and even Stakeholders should familiarize themselves with at least one self-service BI tool.", "Author\u2019s note \u2014 Insights in this article is derived from the online Data Analytics Survey. A sample of 100 responses from professionals working across different verticals of the Data Analytics Industry is used to pen down the trends.", "Bob is currently a Data Analyst in The Cooper Company, a small organization that organizes the Literature Fair in Texas. Bob currently uses MS Excel to keep track of all the events including ticket sales, guest lists, arrangements, event timings and so on. Their CEO, Andy wants to expand this event to three other States and Bob is entitled to create an online tracker that can help the founder keep track of real-time events. It looks like Bob is a Champion at Work. But Bob never worked with a BI tool before. Bob now has an uphill task at hand. He needs to select a platform that comes with real-time data manipulation functionality and also has self-service analytical capability. Poor Bob. Let\u2019s find out all the research he does before deciding on the platform.", "One fine Friday when everyone in the company is planning a team outing, Bob decides to devote his time to understand the market and trends around BI tools. He does some initial research on the capabilities, advantages and focus area of BI tools to understand which tool he should use.", "BI tools are used to achieve the following:", "The majority of BI tools will continue to invest resources into making their platforms scalable and robust. However, the D-CAP framework which represents Data Literacy, Centralization, Analytics, and Performance will remain the major focus areas. Before digging into the trends let\u2019s take a look at what they represent.", "Data Literacy \u2014 \u201cGartner defines data literacy as the ability to read, write, and communicate data in context, including an understanding of data sources and constructs, analytical methods and techniques applied, and the ability to describe the use case application and resulting value.\u201d", "Centralization \u2014 Centralization in BI is the system of storing, managing and maintaining all business intelligence, or data, in one central location or department mostly for governance and security reasons. This model ensures data accuracy, accessibility, and quality of scale.", "Analytics \u2014 Analytics in BI is all about using software and statistics to summarize key information from raw historic data and deliver insights to facilitate data-driven decision making.", "Performance \u2014 Performance in BI covers three key aspects:", "Bob now has a clear clarity on what business intelligence stands for but he still needs a tool to work with! He realized that while some of the articles were inclined to Tableau or QlikSense, a few of them suggested IBM Cognos & Power BI. To prevent any confusion he decides to survey data scientists and other analytics professionals to understand what is in demand today", "A total of 97 working professionals undertook the survey and recorded 163 responses, i.e. on an average every individual ends up using at-least 2 BI tools.", "Bob has now narrowed down his choice of tools to Tableau, Power BI and QlikSense. But he wants to compare all three platforms and see what suits his requirement more.", "The industry is slowly shifting towards self-service BI tools. While working with the airlines, health care, and insurance industry, I have noticed that Tableau and Qlik Sense are the two most widely used BI tools in the market. Qlik Sense is picking up pace especially because of its data transformation capabilities, reducing dependency on the ETL tool. However, the biggest challenge with Qlik Sense is the use of extensions to make better visualization. Extensions are usually third party scripts and bigger organizations with data privacy agreements may not be comfortable using them. If you are interested in scripting then you can focus on one of Tableau or Qlik Sense and R Shiny else its good to have a working knowledge of Tableau & Qlik Sense.", "About the Author: Advanced analytics professional and management consultant helping companies find solutions for diverse problems through a mix of business, technology, and math on organizational data.
