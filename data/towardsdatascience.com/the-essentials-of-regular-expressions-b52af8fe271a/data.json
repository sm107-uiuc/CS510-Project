Perhaps one of the most useful concepts that a Software Engineer can understand and utilise is Regular Expressions. You may have come across them before and have been completely perplexed by the characters you see before you, or you have already used them and want to gain a more comprehensive understanding. This article aims to define what Regular Expressions are, the basics of them and how you can use them, and to provide useful resources for testing RegEx expressions and furthering your learning.", "Regular expressions (or regex for short), allow us to define and set rules to check whether a pattern of characters exist in a text string or not. Regular expressions help us to match, locate and manage text, providing a quick and relatively easy way to manipulate data particularly in large complex programmes.", "Regular Expression: A sequence or pattern of characters used to check the existence or non-existence of a pattern in a text string", "Let\u2019s take email addresses as a quick example. When you sign up for Medium.com you are required by nature to provide an email and password. Behind the scenes Medium.com should (you never know) be using a regular expression to validate that the format of the email address is valid or that the password is valid. Normally it appears as that annoying little message that says, \u201cyour password does not contain one of the following special characters:?,!,.,\u201d, \u2019 etc.\u201d. As a quick example, we could use the following regex to filter emails in a text string that end in \u201c@gmail.com\u201d:", "In reality this might not be a practical use of a regex, but it demonstrates the ability of the regex to test a string for a pattern matching specific characters, in this case, text string\u2019s ending in \u201c@gmail.com\u201d.", "A regular expression is constructed by combining letters and characters. At a simple level if you wanted to test for the word \u2018apple\u2019 or \u2018pear\u2019 then you could just enter this:", "A string containing the word \u201capple\u201d in the first test or a string containing the word \u201cpear\u201d in the second test would both pass. In this sense, most letters and characters will match, however there are characters and special characters that have specific meaning in a regex expression, these are listed below and will be discussed in further detail:", "We will also discuss the concept of greedy vs non-greedy matching in regular expressions. This does seem like a lot to cover, but do not worry as there is a summary at the bottom of the article with the key definitions included, as well as various go-to resources to help you create and remember regular expressions.", "Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning in a regular expression. The table below shows some common regex metacharacters and the definition of each metacharacter:", "To help further your understanding of each metacharacter itself, below are examples of each metacharacter in action", "In this example, the metacharacter \u2018.\u2019 will match any character in the test string. Therefore, the test string \u201cword\u201d will pass in all cases.", "The metacharacter \u201c^\u201d matches the start of the string without consuming any characters. This means that the regular expression is testing for \u201cword\u201d at the start of the test string. If we changed the test string to \u201caword\u201d instead of \u201cword\u201d then the test string would not match the regular expression because \u201cword\u201d is not at the start of the string.", "In this example, the metacharacter tests for \u201cword\u201d at the end of the test string. In contrast to the above if we changed the test string to \u201caword\u201d then the test string would pass because \u201cword\u201d is at the end of the string.", "As the metacharacter \u201c+\u201d tests for one or more consecutive characters, the test string \u201caa\u201d would pass as the regular expression has identified two \u201ca\u201d characters.", "The metacharacter \u2018?\u2019 will test for a character one or more times. In this context the regular expression is testing for the character \u201cba\u201d or more times and not the character \u201ca\u201d itself. In the text string \u201cba\u201d passes as it matches the \u201cba?\u201d regex but \u201cb\u201d will also pass because the regex is testing for the character \u201cb\u201d which is not followed by a special character.", "The square bracket metacharacter is also known as character class and tests for a set of characters enclosed in the brackets. Therefore, the test string will pass completely as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d are all specified as characters inside the square brackets.", "The backslash metacharacter will be discussed in more detail later on, but essentially indicates a special sequence. In this example \u201c\\A\u201d specifies the start of a line therefore \u201chello\u201d would pass the test.", "The \u201c|\u201d regex indicates either or with this regex specifying either the characters \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d. Therefore, the test string would match both \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d in the test string but would not match the word \u201chello\u201d or the space characters.", "The curly bracket metacharacter specifies the number of occurrences of a character. In this example, the regular expression is looking for the pattern of 3 consecutive \u201ca\u201d characters, which the test string provides.", "This matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, indicating the start and end of a group literally. The test string in this example would not match the character \u201ca\u201d or the character \u201cb\u201d but would match the characters \u201cabc\u201d.", "A special sequence is a backslash \u2018\\\u2019 followed by one of the characters in the list below, each which have a special meaning in a regular expression:", "Escape sequences are used to match special characters in a regex. This means that we can use a special character with the \u201c\\\u201d prefix. For example;", "Character classes specify in a regex the characters that you want to match between the square brackets. They allow us to find a range of characters in a text string. Here are some common brackets and a description of what that allows us to specify in a RegEx expression:", "For example, if you want to match an \u201ca\u201d, or a \u201ce\u201d use [ae]. If we specified the world \u201chello\u201d as he[ae]llo then either \u201challo\u201d or \u201chello\u201d would match. Character classes are an extremely common use of regular expressions, and in the email example used at the start of this article we could test for cases when a user accidentally enter \u201c@gmeil.com\u201d rather than \u201c@gmail.com\u201d.", "Some metacharacters mentioned above also fall under the category of occurrence indicators. These are essentially metacharacters that match a number of instances of a character, character group or character class in a string. Multiple occurrence indicators are allowed within one regular expression. These indicators are listed below:", "Anchors do not match any characters but instead match a position, usually before, after or between characters.", "The repetition are greedy operators by default, meaning that the match as many possible characters first. This means that if you tested the following regex:", "The regex would return a full match:", "However, we can manage this by putting an extra \u201c?\u201d after the reptition operators to limit its greediness. Now, when we test the regex expression below with the same test string we actually return two matches.", "Now that we\u2019ve gone through a whistlestop tour of regular expressions and the different metacharacters used, the next thing to do is to practice. Below are some resources which should hopefully help you to create and test your regular expressions.", "A variety of sources exist out there to test Regular Expressions, a few of which I have listed below. They are extremely useful for quickly writing and validating a regular expression, but you should always do further testing of the expression itself by incorporating the regular expression into testing of the solution being built.", "Perhaps my favourite regular expression editor, RegEx offers a clean and easy to use user interface. On the left hand side you can specify the language to the expression will be used in, in the middle you can build and test expressions and on right you can refer to a quick reference manual.", "Useful for JavaScript and PCRE regular expressions, regexr provides a simple user interface with a reference guide on the left hand whilst the right hand side allows you to test expressions. This editor is somewhat limited in that it can only test JavaScript and PCRE.", "Again another useful editor, regextester allows you to write and save regular expressions as well as click on useful hyperlinks that show examples of common regular expressions.", "At the end of the day, picking a regular expression editor is likely to come down to preference. My favourite is regex101 and this is by no means an exhaustive list of editors so it is worth looking around.", "Likewise with RegEx testers, there are also various reference guides available that can help you construct RegEx expressions.", "If you\u2019ve taken the time to read this article then thank you for doing so. Hopefully this has provided some use to you and the resources section can guide your further learning.", "Your home for data science.
