It is also necessary to know the different varieties of regression techniques to implement on your dataset to attain good accuracy with minimum error rate \u270c\ufe0f", "In this article, we will go through a few plots and summary to determine which regression suits for our data set. Also, this article assumes that you have a prior knowledge of regression concept and its assumptions.", "Linear Regression is a very common type of model used for predictive analysis for continuous data. Below is the equation for linear regression.", "Let us go through an example with the below sample dataset.", "Based on the No of weeks (X variable) we need to predict the number of cars sold.", "Below is the scatter plot for the data.", "From the above original scatter plot, we can see that there is a curvature at the end and the linear trend line is not doing justice for this dataset. Let\u2019s build a regression model and interpret the results.", "From the above output, the R Square is 0.80 and the Standard Error is 45. We will try to examine the Residual plot as well.", "The difference between the observed value and the mean value of an observation is called a residual. These are very important for regression because they indicate the extent to which the model accounts for the variation in the dataset.", "From the above, we can see that the residuals are forming a curve pattern which is a violation of one of the major assumptions for a linear model. The residuals should form a randomness but not any type of pattern which leads to predict one error based on the other. Hence, we can determine that the linear model is not suitable for our dataset.", "Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression where it fits a curvilinear relationship between target and independent variables.", "Polynomial regression adds extra independent variables that are the powers of the original variable. Here, we are taking the degree as 2 and hence building a Quadratic regression model.", "Below is the data set created for the Quadratic regression model. An extra independent variable has been added which is No of Weeks*2", "Let\u2019s do a scatter plot and draw a polynomial trendline to check how best the line fits the curve.", "From the above, we can see that the Polynomial trend line is trying to fit the curvature better than a straight line.", "Let us build a model for the Nonlinear dataset we have created earlier.", "From the above output, we can see that the overall R Square value has increased which is 0.90 with a minimized standard error.", "From the above plot, we can see that there is a randomness in the residuals, explaining the variance and hence satisfying the assumption of the regression model.", "In this article, we learned how the non-linear regression model better suits for our dataset which is determined by the non-linear regression output and residual plot.", "Before building any regression model it is very important to review the scatter plots and check the tighter fit of the observations around the regression lines. Also, residual plots play a vital role in decision making as well. However, one should keep in mind that adding more independent variables to non-linear regression can overfit the model. Therefore, utmost care is required while adding more variables to non-linear regression models.", "Thank you for reading and Happy Learning! \ud83d\ude42", "Your home for data science.
