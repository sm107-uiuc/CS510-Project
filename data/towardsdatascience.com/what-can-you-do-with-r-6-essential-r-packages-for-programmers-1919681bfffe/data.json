It was designed for analytics, statistics, and data visualizations. Nowadays, R can handle anything from basic programming to machine learning and deep learning.", "R performs the best when applied to anything data related \u2014 such as statistics, data science, and machine learning.", "The language is most widely used in academia, but many large companies such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Airbnb use it daily.", "To perform any sort of analysis, you first have to load in the data. With R, you can connect to any data source you can imagine. A simple Google search will yield either a premade library or an example of API calls for any data source type.", "For a simple demonstration, we\u2019ll see how to load in CSV data. You can find the Iris dataset in CSV format on this link, so please download it to your machine. Here\u2019s how to load it in R:", "And here\u2019s what the head function outputs \u2013 the first six rows:", "Did you know there\u2019s no need to download the dataset? You can load it from the web:", "That\u2019s all great, but what if you can\u2019t find an appropriate dataset? That\u2019s where web scraping comes into play.", "A good dataset is difficult to find, so sometimes you have to be creative. Web scraping is considered as one of the more \u201ccreative\u201d ways of collecting data, as long as you don\u2019t cross any legal boundaries.", "In R, the rvest package is used for the task. As some websites have strict policies against scraping, we need to be extra careful. There are pages online designed for practicing web scraping, so that\u2019s good news for us. We will scrape this page and retrieve book titles in a single category:", "The titles variable contains the following elements:", "Yes \u2014 it\u2019s that easy. Just don\u2019t cross any boundaries. Check if a website has a public API first \u2014 if so, there\u2019s no need for scraping. If not, check their policies.", "With practical machine learning comes the issue of model deployment. Currently, the best option is to wrap the predictive functionality of a model into a REST API. Showing how to do that effectively would require at least an article or two, so we will cover the basics today.", "In R, the plumber package is used to build REST APIs. Here\u2019s the one that comes in by default when you create a plumber project:", "The plumber package comes with Swagger UI, so you can explore and test your API in the web browser. Let\u2019s take a look:", "This is one of the biggest reasons why R is so popular. There are entire books and courses on this topic, so we will only go over the basics. We intend to cover more advanced concepts in the following articles, so stay tuned to our blog if that interests you.", "Most of the data manipulation in R is done with the dplyr package. Still, we need a dataset to manipulate with \u2013 Gapminder will do the trick. It is available in R through the gapminder package. Here\u2019s how to load both libraries and explore the first couple of rows:", "You should see the following in the console:", "To perform any kind of statistical analysis, you could use R\u2019s built-in functions such as min, max, range, mean, median, quantile, IQR, sd, and var. These are great if you need something specific, but a simple call to the summary function will provide you enough information, most likely:", "Here\u2019s a statistical summary of the Gapminder dataset:", "With dplyr, you can drill down and keep only the data of interest. Let\u2019s see how to show only data for Poland and how to calculate total GDP:", "The corresponding results are shown in the console:", "R is known for its impeccable data visualization capabilities. The ggplot2 package is a good starting point because it\u2019s easy to use and looks great by default. We\u2019ll use it to make a couple of basic visualizations on the Gapminder dataset.", "To start, we will create a line chart comparing the total population in Poland over time. We will need to filter out the dataset first, so it only shows data for Poland. Below you\u2019ll find a code snippet for library imports, dataset filtering, and data visualization:", "You can get a similar visualization with the first two code lines \u2014 the others are added for styling.", "The ggplot2 package can display almost any data visualization type, so let\u2019s explore bar charts next. We want to visualize the average life expectancy over European countries in 2007. Here is the code snippet for dataset filtering and visualization:", "Here\u2019s how the chart looks like:", "Once again, the first two code lines for the visualization will produce similar output. The rest are here to make it look better.", "Yet another area that R handles with ease. The rpart package is great for machine learning, and we will use it to make a classifier for the well-known Iris dataset. The dataset is built into R, so you don\u2019t have to worry about loading it manually. The caTools is used for train/test split.", "Here\u2019s how to load in the libraries, perform the train/test split, fit and visualize the model:", "The snippet shouldn\u2019t take more than a second or two to execute. Once done, you\u2019ll be presented with the following visualization:", "The above figure tells you everything about the decision-making process of the algorithm. We can now evaluate the model on previously unseen data (test set). Here\u2019s how to make predictions, print confusion matrix, and accuracy:", "As you can see, we got a 95% accurate model with only a couple of lines of code.", "For the web app example, we\u2019ll see how to make simple interactive dashboards that displays a scatter plot of the two user-specified columns. The dataset of choice is also built into R \u2014 mtcars.", "Here is a script for the Shiny app:", "And here\u2019s the corresponding Shiny app:", "This dashboard is as simple as they come, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t develop beautiful-looking apps with Shiny.", "To conclude \u2014 R can do almost anything that a general-purpose programming language can do. The question isn\u2019t \u201cCan R do it\u201d, but instead \u201cIs R the right tool for the job\u201d.", "If you are working on anything data-related, then yes, R can do it and is a perfect candidate for the job.", "If you don\u2019t intend to work with data in any way, shape, or form, R might not be the optimal tool. Sure, R can do almost anything, but some tasks are much easier to do in Python or Java.", "Want to learn more about R? Start here:", "Loved the article?
