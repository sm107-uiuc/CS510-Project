The interviewer may be trying to check whether the candidate has the capability to think of all scenarios for a particular question or not.", "The interviewer may give you some data set fields with their data types and give you an SQL query to extract some of the particular elements from it. The interviewer may be trying to check whether the candidate has the capability to think of all scenarios for a particular question or not.", "Programming knowledge is very necessary for a data science interview as it proves your ability to write code to solve the problem. Mainly, data science problems are solved using Python or R, so choose any one language (Python/R) in which you are comfortable and try to approach the given problem in a very simplified manner.", "While preparing for a Data Scientist position, one should have a deep understanding of all machine learning models and learn how to explain the model with hands made diagrams, the purpose of the model, and also its advantage and disadvantage for a particular activity or task. Some of the main machine learning algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, na\u00efve bayes, decision tree, support vector machines, etc.", "Probability and Statistics pay an important role in extracting the important information from a data set and having deep knowledge of statistical terms like standard deviation, the p-value for the hypothesis, correlation, covariance, etc., also the condition when they are used.", "Data Science is a vast field and has much application around ourselves, so if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge other than technical skills, he/she may provide you an example of any surrounding problem and ask you to design a solution using your data science skills.  For example, a scenario of getting rain today, what will be the major features behind it, a machine learning model that can be used to predict that if it rains on a particular day or not.", "Behavioral questions are asked to check how you deal with real-life problems and this can be used as an opportunity to impress the interviewer with some unique answers and make him/her little bias towards you as compared to another interviewee. Some examples of behavioral question are given below: \u2022 What motivates you at work? \u2022 What do you think are the most pressing issues in this field? \u2022 What is your greatest strength/weakness? \u2022 Why do you think you will like this field? \u2022 Describe a time when you worked closely with someone who had a very different personality than you? \u2022 Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was the situation and how did you get through it? \u2022 Tell me about a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep organized and make sure everything was moving along as planned?", "Hoping this article will help you preparing for a Data Science interview and getting your dream job.
