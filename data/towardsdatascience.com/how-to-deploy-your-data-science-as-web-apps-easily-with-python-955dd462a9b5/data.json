With Streamlit, you create your app with pure python and stop worrying about front end development. Implementing it in your local server is just one command away. If you want to use it on the web, you can host it in any other cloud platform.", "In this tutorial, you will build a data visualisation app with python and streamlit. Later we deploy it in Heroku for the public use. Here is a teaser of what we will build and deploy in Heroku.", "We install Streamlit with pip like this:", "Running Streamlit is as simple as running:", "Right now, we have not created our app yet. But before we move on to do that, we create a GitHub repository which we will later use deploying the app in Heroku. Once you create the Github repository, clone it.", "From now on, we work on this folder. So go to this folder:", "In the next section, we develop a python Data visualisation application.", "You can use your favourite development environment. Let us create a python file to write the app. You can name it whatever you want. I will call mine app.py", "We first import libraries we need.", "The data for this tutorial is Crimes reported in Washington between January and June 2016. Let us create a function to help to do that for us.", "Let us create the main function that runs our app automatically when we execute it. First, we get the data by using the function above and call it df_data. We also start writing headers( st.header) and adding an image (st.image) to our app.", "With this simple and pure python code, we can spin-off as a Streamlit app locally. You need to run:", "And walla! Your app will start in your browser. Let us check what we have so far. A header, subheader text and an image as you can see from below screenshot. It runs on localhost port 8501.", "Let us add more functionality to our application. We will do that incrementally. We start by displaying some rows of the dataset in the app. We also show the shape of the entire dataset. To control the displaying item, you can use st.checkbox and once clicked; it will show what comes in the indented code. st.write can take pandas like operations so if you want to display the head, we can do this.", "Add above code in the main function and save it. Now if you go to your browser and refresh or rerun your app, you will have a checkbox, and if you click it, you will see the first rows of the dataset.", "Let us add a map to our application. First, we create a function that returns a Plotly figure.", "Inside the main function, we can call out st.plotly_chart. There are some inbuilt charting functions including Matplotlib, Bokeh and more but any other libraries not implemented so far in streamlit are also possible as we will see next using Folium library.", "The above code will add a beautiful Plotly map in our application as you can see from below screenshot.", "If you want to use sidebar you can use, st.sidebar with any other streamlit functionality. This method will create your app elements in the sidebar. Let us see an example of using sidebar with drop-down selection \u2014 selectbox.", "First, we create choices \u2014 Heatmap and count plot.", "Let us create a function for the heat map.", "Notice here that we are using st.markdown. The folium library is not yet implemented in Streamlit, but we can create it a folium map this way in the above code.", "Now, let us fill out our choices with heatmap and countplot.", "If you rerun your app in the browser, you should see a sidebar with choices. If we select the heatmap, our app will look like this.", "In the next section, we deploy the app in Heroku, where you can build apps free. You can also deploy with AWS or Google Cloud Platform if you want, but in this tutorial, I will use Heroku.", "First, make sure you sign up in Heroku. Then, we need to create four files to deploy our app in the cloud: Procfile, config file, requirements and runtime. Let us create first the Procfile. Here is where we provide what to run when we want to spin off the app in Heroku. Here is how the Procfile looks:", "Save and name your file \u201cProcfile\u201d without any extensions.", "Next, we create the config file, name it create_config.sh and paste the following code into it.", "The requirement file holds the libraries that the app needs. You can use pip freeze. Here is how the requirements.txt file looks:", "Finally, the runtime file specifies the python version you want to run with the app.", "Now we need to push these new files to our Github repository.", "Our local files are now pushed to our Github repository, and we can start deploying the app in Heroku. Run the following command in the command line and press any key.", "A new browser will pop up. Sign in Heroku with your credentials. Once you do that, get back to your command line and create a Heroku app like this.", "Finally, we need to push Heroku.", "Your app will open in a new browser, or you can click on the URL provided. That is it, you can share this URL with anyone, and they will access your application from anywhere.", "In this tutorial, we have created a data visualisation app with python and streamlit. We also deployed the app in the cloud with Heroku.
