If that is true, is there a way to incorporate champion class composition data to predict the match outcome? Sure there are many other factors that affect the outcome of the game, but many times when a game is won or lost, people point at the pick-ban phase (the champion drafting phase) to blame for the result. Perhaps a study into this can tell us to what extent we can blame the coaches for right/wrong picks and bans.", "In this study, I used k-means clustering to divide the champions into various clusters, which I will sometimes refer to from now on as \u201cclasses\u201d. Some of the derived clusters coincide with our regular notion of champion classes: for example, one cluster is filled with ranged, AD based champions, a cluster we might comfortably call as the Marksman class. Others are not as intuitive. Using this classification, however, does not yield any positive increase in the prediction accuracy of various neural network models. This seems to suggest, although it is not definitive, that champion class composition by itself has no predictive power.", "There exists no previous literature that studies the classification of champions. There are a few studies to note, however, to anticipate the result of this study. Hall (2017) shows that completely disregarding champion selection and only taking player statistics from the past 20 matches is sufficient to produce 84.4% accuracy in LoL match prediction. Considering the complexity of LoL, it is hard to assume that additional feature like champion class composition could add on to this already stifling high accuracy.", "Furthermore, Huang et al (2015) uses individual win-rates on specific champions to achieve a staggering 91% accuracy in predicting match outcome, which is much better than the 64% they achieved using only champion picks as input features. Considering that their Naive Bayes classifier on champion pick feature probably incorporates more knowledge than just champion composition, we can likely conclude that however effective the selected features for this study are, the resulting accuracy will come out lower than 64%.", "These two past studies suggest that the importance of player skill overwhelms the importance of champion picks; the champion class composition, therefore, would be of much lower importance.", "If class composition is projected to be so unimportant, why test it out at all?", "There\u2019s no way to phrase this so that it looks more significant; the only reason for this study is to actually prove the intuition that champion class composition is unimportant. Or, with some miracle, find out that it is indeed significant to some degree.", "If we were to use a shallow feedforward neural network taking champion class tags as input features, the resulting accuracy hovers around 50%, plus-minus 1%. Varying the training set and test set, tweaking hyper-parameters and averaging over various runs do not help in increasing the prediction accuracy.", "By champion class tags, I mean the class tags that each champion is given by Riot upon its release. For example, Caitlyn is given a Marksman tag, and Diana is given a Fighter tag and Mage tag. There are a total of six given classes: Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Assassin, Tank, Support.", "To get the baseline prediction accuracy above, the first method I tried was to retrieve the tag for each champion in each team of the game, turn them into one-hot vectors, then sum them, thus getting a 6 sized vector for each team. I then concatenated them into a 12 sized vector and normalized accordingly before feeding into the neural net.", "As this did not amount to anything significant, I filtered through the dataset to extract game files in which champion lanes and roles were marked correctly (RiotApi is infamous for messing this up\u2026smh), then only used these filtered game files as train/test set, only this time I concatenated all the one-hot vectors according to lane (top, jungle, mid, bottom, support respectively in order) and skipped the summation part. This got me a 60 sized input feature, which again, showed dismal prediction accuracy despite all the hyper-parameter tweaking.", "Basing a result on Riot\u2019s champion class tags, however, is not really fair, as Riot often just gets it wrong (as with their RiotApi). To better classify the champions, therefore, I decided to use k-means clustering, an unsupervised clustering algorithm.", "I used michel\u2019s fanboi dataset on Kaggle to retrieve gameId of 9800 games in Platinum tier, and fetched these running an ec2 instance for 2~3 days, using RiotWatcher for rate-limit guidance. From the accrued match data, 9000 were used as training set, and the rest 800 as the test set.", "I also applied the same filtering function as the one I used in calculating the baseline accuracy. The filtered training set numbered 3695, and the filtered test set numbered 343.", "To apply k-means clustering, I must specify on which dimensions LoL champions will be classified on. The selected dimensions are as follows:", "I used Pandas framework to load all the training set csv files, then took the mean of all the columns listed above. The next step was to normalize the data, then to use sklearn\u2019s clustering library to apply k-means clustering algorithm. With k-means it is necessary to specify the number of clusters, which makes it one of the hyper-parameters for this project. Peaking ahead, 15~20 clusters showed to be the most optimal.", "To form the input features, I used the same two approaches attempted in calculating the baseline accuracy, only this time using the result of the clustering algorithm for champion classification.", "The 20 clusters resulting from k-means algorithm are as follows:", "Normally I would write down the hyper-parameters, number of layers of the neural network, etc, but I refrain from doing so for the reason that the resulting prediction accuracy is not satisfactory, and one of the suspected reasons is my inaptitude in hyper-parameter tuning.", "That said, multiple attempts were made to fine-tune the network. It was worth noticing that increasing the number of layers & the size of the layers of the network only seemed to encourage overfitting. Logistic regression actually produced the best results.", "Since the resulting prediction accuracy varied slightly depending on the run, I took the average of 50 runs, which came out to be 54.17%. While it beats the baseline accuracy, the resulting accuracy is only slightly better than guessing the winning team blindfolded. There could be several reasons for this.", "First, the selected dimensions for k-means clustering algorithm may be inappropriate. Take group 9, for example. Champions here are clearly grouped together because of their high percentage of true damage, but in that process Vayne, a ranged Marksman champion, is grouped together with Garen, a melee tank champion. Further work should have been done to assign weights to respective dimensions to more accurately classify champions, although its impact on overall prediction accuracy is suspect.", "Second, I might have used a wrong clustering algorithm for the task. K-means clustering algorithm divides champions into discrete groups, but a better choice could have been, for example, Gaussian mixture models for expectation-maximizing clustering, which allows certain data points to be included into multiple clusters. This makes sense for many champion in League, who could be classified as both mage, marksman, initiator, etc.", "Third, the selected dataset is only from Platinum tier level. If there are certain biases in this skill level such that the emphasis on champion composition is obsolete, then the result here cannot be generalized for the entire LoL game.", "However, I do believe that improving the model based on the factors mentioned above probably won\u2019t amount to a big improvement in prediction accuracy. In fact, the results here go in line with conclusions from previous literatures, as I have mentioned in former sections.", "Thus it seems rational to conclude that champion class composition is most probably unimportant in determining the match outcome.", "Your home for data science.
