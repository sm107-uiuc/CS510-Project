Finally, I can write an article again. There are several ideas that I would want to write. Before, I want to write about another fun project with Deep Learning. Unfortunately, the plan got sidetracked because I got other things to do. After I\u2019m free, I forgot the project and decided to abandon it. Then, I suddenly want to write about my research career experience. Hence, I present you with this article.", "In this article, I want to share what I have learned in my job. For your information, I am an AI Research Scientist in Kata.ai. My job desk is to research to tackle some Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems with Machine Learning (ML). It has been one year for me worked as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Researcher where previously, my job was not a researcher. I would say that I am relatively new in this career.", "Based on my experience that emphasizes AI\u2019s research environment, I want to share the researcher traits based on my experience working on my research team. The team consists of several Ph.D. graduates. I want to give you an overview of some of the researcher traits. The overview is based on my view, which has just stepped on a researcher career. I hope it provides some insights for anyone who has interested in it.", "I think this trait is necessary for someone who wants to become a researcher. As you can see, this career\u2019s job is to research something, discover something such as insight based on the research result. The reason is that we need to make sure that the finding is valid. In other words, we want to make people believe that our result is substantial.", "One of the attitudes that I feel about how we do critical thinking is skepticism. It is pretty counter-intuitive, right? Where we usually need optimism on solving a problem, but here we use skepticism. What is it about?", "Skepticism in here means that we doubt a research result. For example, when we find some paper that tells that the paper\u2019s finding is promising, We ask this in our mind: \u201cIs it true? I do not think that this approach work on B\u201d.", "This mindset can give a new research idea. You can validate the statement that you doubt, and if it is true, it can be a new research project that want to be solved.", "Before I went to the research team, I was a person who thinks that when that paper has cool intuition and approach, and popular is great. Thanks to my team that I can shed some light on this mindset. Not that I become fully skeptic toward any papers, but at least I got \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d statement in my brain, especially when I read something that claims great at everything.", "I have a friend that study for a bachelor\u2019s degree did a research project in NLP. Since he is unfamiliar with it, he decided to ask a Ph.D. student to become his advisor. His advisor gave the paper that has a promising method on it. The advisor suggests my friend use the paper\u2019s approach for his project. He decided to trust the research paper that his advisor gave. Unfortunately, at the end of the project, he failed to create a good model with the paper\u2019s approach, thus cost him a bad grade for that subject. A year later, he realizes that the paper is crap.", "From the story above, if my friend has a critical thinking trait, he can avoid bad grades. Being skeptical about whether the paper is good or not can save you. Nevertheless, skepticism does not mean that we always think negatively onto something, but we assess the object that we pay attention to objectively.", "With researching as the daily task for researcher, curiosity, in my humble opinion, must present in the mindset of any researcher. With having a curiosity trait, we can enrich the research finding. Thus, making the result more insightful to be digested.", "When we (my research team) are given a problem, we discuss several ideas on how to solve the problem. The discussion is one of the events where the sense of curiosity of a researcher is needed. We formulate several hypotheses, thinking several approaches might be worth to try to solve the problem.", "In my team, when we answer a research question, it usually won\u2019t end with that. This is also where curiosity is needed. Specifically, after we have done implementing and experimenting with a question, we need to analyze the result. Often, several questions pop on their head to explore other things related to the result when analyzing the result. For example, for an AI researcher that focuses on Deep Learning, when he develops a new architecture model that gives significant results, he can be tempted to question its goodness. One of the methods is doing an ablation study, where he can experiment where he can see if the quality degrades when a part of the new model is not present. With curiosity, it can enrich the analysis of the finding, which may further convince the reader.", "To sum it up, curiosity enhances the research work further. In my opinion, the result of the research works, one of them is shaped by the team\u2019s curiosity. When giving enough curiosity, it will output an insightful finding.", "Not all research experiments output the desired result since a researcher walk to research the unknown. So, be tough when a research result gives terrible results.", "In my experience, I have experienced many failed experiments. At first, it is unfortunate for me to know that my experiment is fruitless. But, later, I realized that failure is a lesson that can make me a better researcher. The failure experience told me the error which needs to be avoided in the future. What does not kill you make you stronger, right?", "So yeah, by accepting your failure, it will make you grow. Nevertheless, when a research project fails, it does not mean that all that work is for naught. You can write why you fail in a research paper. It is also an insight for anyone who wants to research on solving a similar problem. Unfortunately, everyone is so fixated on a \u2018successful\u2019 research result than the failure one. In my opinion, I think that a failure story is more valuable than the successful one, which can be a warning for someone not to do it again. Though, The written report needs to emphasize the reason for the failure to be valuable thoroughly.", "So, be tough that a research experiment can give a bad result. Learn and move forward from it!", "After experimenting, we will have a finding or something that we proudly research. So what\u2019s next? Yes, tell the result to everyone about its coolness!", "A written report is one of the channels to tell everyone. In my team, we often write a research paper as the form of the report. It is one of our media, where we communicate our finding to the outside.", "When we talk to someone, we know that we need to make sure that our message can be understood. Then, when we want to convince someone that our opinion is reliable, we need to give some reasonable arguments. It is the same as how we write a report. We need to systematically write a reasonable and easy to understand report to convince that our finding is fruitful. Then, the more insightful and easy to follow our writing is, the more people can acknowledge what we research.", "I learned here that when we write the paper, we need to write a story to connect our finding systematically. We need to connect the motivation, background, experiment result, and the analysis to make the report. We think that It will make our readers satisfied and enjoy our work.", "Well.. Actually, the main reason is to pass the reviewer\u2019s judgment on submitting the paper \ud83d\ude06.", "In this article, I gave several researcher traits that I feel based on my experience working with an AI research team. They are Critical Thinking, Curiosity, Tough, and Systematic Writer. Each of the traits can benefit how they do research projects better.", "To be honest, I am still far from being a full-fledged researcher after seeing how a Ph.D. graduates AI researcher work. But I like working with them, especially in discussing how to tackle a problem. I learned a lot from them, especially on how they approach the problem.", "Thank you for reading my article \ud83d\ude03. Next time, I want to write something technical on AI. Please give me some strengths to write my next article.", "I welcome any feedback that can improve myself and this article. I\u2019m in the process of learning on writing and learning to become better. I appreciate any feedback to make me better.", "See ya in my next article!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Mad AI Enthusiast. I write mostly about Artificial Intelligence and Self Development.
