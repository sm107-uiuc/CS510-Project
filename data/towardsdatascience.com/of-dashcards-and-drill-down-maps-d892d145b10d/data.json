Number of cases rising, fatalities, rates of infection, some curves peaking, others flattening. The picture is pretty grim, no matter how you slice it, or how you present it. However, in building our understanding of the impact the novel coronavirus has had in all corners of the world, it is important to remember that, in the world of Data Visualization, Context is King. Context helps build understanding.", "I first read the phrase \u201c Context is King\u201d in a blog post by Dalton Ruer, a.k.a QlikDork. Then found other sources that elaborated on the idea. In any case, It has always been an important part of Dashboard design, but today I intend to present an example of how adding context to a visual helps paint a more accurate representation of the performance being measured. Understanding what\u2019s behind that number we look at everyday, whether in social issues or in the business realm, what is driving a certain performance metric, and how it has been trending over time, will lead to better decisions.", "The types of context we can provide around a performance metric would typically be one or more of the following:", "It may seem like a daunting task to add all the above into a dashboard, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. And we don\u2019t have to add all types of contextual hints to all metrics we\u2019re monitoring, just the most relevant for what we\u2019re trying to communicate and that would help the user build understanding of the data without cluttering the dashboard and distracting from its main purpose. When used effectively, context will help the user avoid having to do mental calculations to make sense of the numbers on the screen, and prevent them from drawing incorrect conclusions about the data being presented.", "Over the past few weeks I have been working on building a Dashcard visualization object to make it easy to visualize the context around a certain KPI, and in a condensed view that\u2019s easy to digest. To build a proof of concept, I decided to use data related to the coronavirus pandemic, provided by Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Health, which resulted in the interactive dashboard displayed below.", "The dashboard displayed below shows two Dashcards, one with the number of Confirmed Cases, and one with the number of Observed Fatalities. Besides showing the main metric (total number), each dashcard provides the following contextual hints:", "The dashboard also has a drill-down choropleth map, to show location context and to visually display how the various regions compare to each other. When clicking on a state, the map would provide more granular context that\u2019s specific to that state, showing the breakdown by municipality, also with their geographic context.", "The buttons at the top of the map allow the user to interact with the dashboard by changing the measure being used to compare the regions on the map (button group on the left), and also by toggling the view to switch the metric between an absolute number and one shown in terms of population (incidences per 100,000 people), the proportionality context, controlled by the button labeled \u201cVer por Tasa\u201d. You can see how toggling this context on and off paints a very different picture that yields a better understanding of the data. This toggle also affects the main KPI displayed on the two Dashcard objects.", "Finally, there\u2019s a trend view at the bottom that allows the user to view the overall trend for the selected measure, while also allowing them to zoom into specific time periods.", "I\u2019ve included the dashboard below as a screenshot. If you prefer to view an interactive version, you can open the main view of this demo here.", "The proof of concept above may still benefit from additional features that I didn\u2019t get a chance to implement, at least for now. For instance, we may need to add a legend on the map to show the scale on which the regions\u2019 color is calculated. Additionally, the tooltips on the map may also benefit from a redesign, and those sparklines in the Dashcards could also benefit from having some tooltips. These features will be added soon.", "The Dashcard object is a custom design I created, and is pre-rendered server-side with the D3.js library, and updated on the client-side as the user navigates the dashboard. It is configurable with the use of a declarative language for describing the elements of the visualization, similar to Vega-Lite, and the elements are automatically aligned based on this configuration to create a pixel-perfect view of the data.", "It has the advantage of adapting to any screen size to keep the geometric precision of the elements\u2019 position and size, as well as re-adjusting them on the fly to accommodate the new values that are to be displayed as the user interacts with the data.", "Hope you\u2019ve found this informative. Feel free to leave a comment below and connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
