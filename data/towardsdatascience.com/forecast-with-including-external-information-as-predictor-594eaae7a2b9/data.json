The most used forecasting method is only using its historical data such as trend and seasonality while ignoring the remainder factor (information obtained from external source). However, it was not wrong but not wise enough if we are working with some data which have a high correlation with some external information. For example, the effects of the holiday season in the tourism industry, the inflation rate in the finance & banking industry, competitor action, and many more conditions require external information to be considered.", "While data science tools have grown significantly, it helps forecaster to simplify their works. We will take an example of using R to create a forecast, including external information, as part of its predictor.", "Our dataset contains monthly information of Rainfall, Rainy days, Average Temperature in Bandung, Indonesia;", "Bandung dataset contains time series information in the range of 2014 to 2019. As it should be done before conducting any analysis work, we need to have a clear goal that we want to solve, in this case, we will set our goal as for Predicts Rain days on 2020 Period. Using either both or one of Rainfalls or temperatures, we will try to create a simple forecasting method to reach our goal.", "The decomposition of the time series is one of the most powerful techniques to explore any information inside the data. Using this, we can calculate trend and seasonality strength and find the remainder pattern out of its trend and seasonality. If we rule out external information, we will only make use of seasonality and trend patterns to be analyzed and considers the remainder component as an error. The difference when we use external information as our predictor is we can explain the remainder components\u2019 variations using our external information, or in simple terms, remainder components composed by our external information.So, how to determine which information we should use as our external predictor? The most useful but straightforward way is to check its correlation with our target variable:", "Rainfalls is the one that has a moderate correlation with raindays. We will make use of this variable as our external predictor. But, let\u2019s take a peek at the curve between those variables at first:", "At a glance on this simple plot, we can see raindays (bottom) and rainfalls (top) share even not precisely due to but still similar movement due to their correlation during the periods.", "Auto Arima function in R makes forecasting even easier than how its look. But to includes external information on our model, we must specify the xreg argument with our predictor (external information). In the end, auto.arima() will take the rest of the calculation and find the best model for us.", "auto.arima() choose non-seasonal ARIMA model with 5-order of Auto-regressive and one differencing, with errors is implicated as our xreg (external predictor). If we see the details of our model, the xreg component was not so impactful for the calculation compared to the 5-order of AR. But we will go on since it is an only simple tutorial using a simple dataset. For another dataset, external prediction can be more impactful on the model calculation.", "Residuals check which been done shows the residuals are uncorrelated between each other and it means our model is good to use.", "To forecast using a model with external information, we need to obtain future values of our external information. This step has a different treatment for different datasets. If we can straightforward predict its future values based on expertise, we can directly use it. But, if we can\u2019t instantly predict its future values, we can make a separate model and forecast its future value on the same horizon with our main forecasting target. For our case, we will use auto.arima() to build another model and forecast its future value:", "With external predictor values which been known, we finally can conduct a forecast for 2020 Raindays and visualize its result.", "Our forecast show there will be two months (June and December) in 2020, which has the lowest rainy days in a month, and the highest rainy days amount occurs in March and September.", "So, that\u2019s how we do forecasting with includes external information as one of the regressors in the model. In more detail, we can also compare the forecast only using trend and seasonality with the forecast which utilize external information and find which model is better. However, whichever method you choose, that\u2019s not wrong, since the different data need different treatment.", "For disclaimer, this article only discusses how to include external regressors on our time series model, so in a real case of predicting rainy days, I suggest consulting with climate experts and finding another variable that correlates with how rainy days occurred.", "You can find the dataset on this link.", "Your home for data science.
