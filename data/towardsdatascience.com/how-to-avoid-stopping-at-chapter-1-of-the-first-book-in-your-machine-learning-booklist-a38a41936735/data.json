But have you finished reading the books inside?", "I found that when I was enthusiastic about reading a new book, this enthusiasm would be exhausted somewhere before I reached the central part of the book.", "I was stuck in Chapter 1 for most of the books that I didn\u2019t finish. So, back then, the only things I read hundreds of times from the books were the history of machine learning and the basic concepts of machine learning.", "About half a year ago, I tried to address the problem of reading the Chapter 1s over and over again. I created a reading strategy and it has been working pretty well for me.", "I am sharing it with you using my own booklist in machine learning as an example. If you have the same problem with me, I hope this article can help you. No need to copy everything from me, but it\u2019s worth a try to apply this strategy to your booklist.", "The reason I want to read the books in machine learning can be explained by two layers of needs. First, I want to be able to type my machine learning codes as soon as I start reading the books. Second, I want to be able to understand the algorithms after finishing the reading.", "The first layer is engineering-oriented, and the second is research-oriented.", "Based on these needs, I kept four books in my final booklist:", "Book #1 and #2 are selected for the hands-on project coding, and book #3 and #4 are selected for the mathematical theory learning.", "After getting my filtered booklist, I classified them into groups by two dimensions.", "The first dimension is the content and the second is the function, as shown in the following table.", "I designed the classification in the way I am comfortable with. Specifically, I used \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cDeep Learning\u201d to split the books that cover a wide range of topics in machine learning and those that focus on deep neural networks.", "I defined those books with heavy equations and mathematical explanations as \u201cDictionary\u201d and those with tons of lines of codes as \u201cManual\u201d.", "Arbitrary nomenclature, but useful to me.", "As for the books classified as \u201cMachine Learning\u201d in the previous step, I put book #3 beside my hands and started reading book #1 from Chapter 2 named \u201cEnd-to-End Machine Learning Project\u201d.", "During the reading, I referred to book #3 whenever I want a deeper understanding of the terms explained in book #1.", "For example, when I read about DecisionTreeRegressor on page #70 of book #1, I opened my book #3 and read through the Regression Trees in subsection 9.2.2 on page #307. Then I went back to page #70 of book #1 and read the related paragraphs again.", "The implementation of this strategy took me some time to get familiar at the beginning, but I significantly increased my reading efficiency after getting used to it.", "One of the tricks to save my time opening and closing books is to download an electric version of book #3 and use it together with a paper version of book #1.", "After learning the analysis of the California house data in book #1, I applied the same code on the car dataset in R.", "I didn\u2019t simply copy and paste the code from one dataset to another. I applied the basic data visualization tool that I learned from book #1 on the new dataset and raised several questions I would like to ask based on the visualization.", "These questions could be really simple. For example, can the mpg be predicted by the other features, such as the number of cylinders and the gross horsepower? The purpose is to train the ability to ask questions after the first glance of the data.", "Next, the modeling part was done according to those questions. For example, I built a random forest regressor on the car dataset with the mpg as the dependent variable.", "The reason why I put this step here is not because of my hate of Chapter 1s.", "As I said, usually Chapter 1 describes the history of Machine Learning, the basic concepts, and the social behaviors towards Machine Learning (such as the variation of investment in machine learning research across time). With all the other parts of the book finished, Chapter 1 looked much more informative to me than before.", "In addition, reading Chapter 1 as the last step helped me generate my new booklist in machine learning. Specifically, I became more interested in the future of AI after knowing the history and challenges in applying machine learning methods to our daily life.", "So, I generated my new booklist which I am working on as below:", "People usually underestimate the ability of storytelling in the machine learning field.", "All the techniques cannot form a story by themselves unless your purpose is to develop new algorithms, for which it\u2019s far from sufficient to read several books. The best practice is to apply the machine learning skills to the real-world problems with your domain knowledge.", "In addition, the first-hand experience developed from the practices cannot be found in any book. This is another article I wrote about one of such experiences in detail.", "I really hope my reading strategy can help you finish your booklist and take a further step in data science.", "Your home for data science.
