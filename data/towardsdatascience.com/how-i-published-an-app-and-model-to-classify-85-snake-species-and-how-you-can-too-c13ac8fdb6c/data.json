I was frightened, scared, and lacked confidence. However, after weeks of contemplation, I bit the bullet and announced I\u2019d create a simple image classification model.", "Now here I am with an app officially available on the Play Store and a GitHub repo with its open-sourced code. I\u2019d like to explain the hurdles I\u2019ve faced and the lessons I\u2019ve learnt overcoming them (in hopes it\u2019ll help you out too)!", "In short, I made a LOT of mistakes, and that\u2019s precisely how I learnt. Google scrapping for images allowed me to appreciate the effort involved in creating a dataset with 120, 000 images. Starting with linear regression was a grand, stupid and hilarious blunder, but it taught me the value of CNN\u2019s and pre-trained models first hand. Trying linear regression for such a task also forced me to find out how and why neural networks work! The long training times and mediocre results from a plain pre-trained model caused me to find Super Convergence!", "My mistakes were like stages, without each and every one of them I wouldn\u2019t have learnt anywhere near the amount I did", "An obvious question is why bother overcoming hurdle after hurdle when a free MOOC can teach the same content (maybe even taking less time and effort). I\u2019ve already answered the question, but in short, it comes down to:", "You remember information which you repeatedly use, and progressively forget all else", "Now, this doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t go through any MOOC\u2019s/tutorials, but just make sure you don\u2019t get \u201cstuck in tutorial hell\u201d! Instead, if you know the basics apply the stuff you\u2019ve learnt right now to create a cool, interesting project you can show off!", "The fact you\u2019re questioning your current skill, knowledge and theoretical foundation level indicates that you\u2019re aware of the limits of your understanding! This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re stupid, or not ready, but instead, you\u2019ve learnt enough to know that there\u2019s way more ahead of you.", "Just understand that there will always be more to learn, so may as well start using what you already know", "Two things you can do to judge:", "If you\u2019re unsure how complex the project will be, consider how others have faired on similar tasks. One way to find out is to search for online articles or research papers. If you find hundreds then the problem is probably too simple, but if you only find a few it\u2019s probably unrealistic (or you\u2019ve got a genius idea). Knowledge on the topic at hand is a must, so just research the topic and see what you find out!", "If you don\u2019t already have any connections to data scientists, then you\u2019re going to have to reach out (like I did)! I\u2019d do this ASAP no matter what, as it\u2019s always incredibly useful to have a variety of opinions on any situation. My personal method is to reach out to data scientists near me saying I\u2019m studying machine learning and looking for some advice. Most people reject, but if you put enough out it still works!", "Find out WHY your project can\u2019t work!", "If finding out why an idea can\u2019t work doesn\u2019t unravel another solution, then you\u2019ve found out something new\u2026 and that\u2019s an accomplishment!", "Find similar problems to the one you\u2019re trying to solve. For me, I started with tutorials on how to use PyTorch to classify digits (MNIST) and more complex objects (CIFAR100). I followed the tutorials and figured out how they achieved their task. I then used transfer learning, replicating what each tutorial had done, but this time for my own problem.", "Of course, I was far from ready to tackle the full challenge but with time I figured out more and more.", "If you\u2019re still stuck though, you may actually need to go back to the books (or courses).", "Just stick at it and after a while, something will click! At the beginning of creating my first model, none of my code ran, but eventually (after a few days), I managed to find the bug and fix it. Know I get how to run training and evaluation loops with PyTorch! Note that it\u2019s often a small minor change which finally revives the code (so play around, debug a lot and you\u2019ll figure it out).", "Theory can be difficult. You can have a working model, but not know anything about how the transfer learning model, optimizer, loss function\u2026 or something else you\u2019ve used works. But how long does it take to train the model\u2026 hours, days, weeks? If you can write the code, do that, run it and just learn the theory whilst it\u2019s working. Your both training then (pun intended)!", "I\u2019ve got a blog post specifically on how to improve your model. Take a look once you\u2019ve got a working model!", "Learn, create, improve, show off, rinse and repeat!", "Just create blogs, create projects and continue through that cycle.", "Now that you\u2019ve heard me ramble, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to read through my blog (or skipping to the end).", "If this has helped you out consider checking out how to choose a model!", "Your home for data science.
