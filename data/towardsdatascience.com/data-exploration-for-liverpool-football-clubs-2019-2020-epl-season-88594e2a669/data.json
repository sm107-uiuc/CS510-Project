It was their title winning season after all!", "I used the same dataset that he got from kaggle.", "As I browsed the dataset, I had one question in mind \u2014 did Liverpool really earn their victory? Was there quantitative evidence to support or refute the argument that Liverpool were just lucky this season?", "The initial bit was relatively simple. I used Jupyter Notebooks as my main analysis environment and imported the usual tools (numpy, pandas). Then, like Sonor, I downloaded the csv file from kaggle and read it into a dataframe.", "576 rows and 44 columns worth of data. Each row represents the data about a particular match, from one team\u2019s perspective. This means that each match that has been played is actually two rows of data, not one. Something to bear in mind when working with this dataset.", "As I browsed the dataset, I decided that there were 6 particular columns I wanted to focus on \u2014 Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, Expected Goals Scored, Expected Goals Conceded, Points, and Expected Points.", "Some explanation around the \u201cexpected\u201d metrics is probably necessary.", "Expected points (expected Points, xPts, etc.) are an extension of the expected Goals (xG) models\u2026 Given the expected goals values each team created during a match, one can take these values and simulate it thousands of times to calculate the probabilities that the game will result in a win/draw/loss. From these probabilities (match odds) we can convert them into how many points (anywhere between 0 and 3) that a team could win given the xG they and their opponents accumulated", "So to try and answer the question\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwere Liverpool lucky\u201d, I needed to suss out one metric that perhaps \u201crepresented\u201d luck and see how Liverpool compared with its peers.", "My first thought was to use \u201cpoints minus expected points\u201d. This seemed reasonable enough. If \u201cpoints\u201d was how many points a team actually obtained, and \u201cexpected points\u201d was how many points a team was supposed to have obtained, the difference would represent how lucky (positive number) or unlucky (negative number) a team was. A large number in either direction would represent a significant deviation from what \u201cshould\u201d have happened.", "So with this in mind, I could get started on the analysis:", "Step 1: Create a column labelled \u201cPoints-Expected Points\u201d. This reflects the degree to which a team under or over performed the expectation for each match.", "Step 2: Derive the mean and the sum for each team (i.e. the average and total \u2018Points minus Expected Points\u2019 for a team across the season)", "As you can see, the results were pretty astounding. There is a pretty huge gap between Liverpool and the next \u2018luckiest\u2019 competitor, Newcastle. Over the course of the season, Liverpool significantly outperformed the expected points per match.", "After looking at the Points-Expected Points comparison, I felt that more work was necessary. After all, Expected Points still seemed like a fairly opaque metric, given it is a derivative of the Expected Goals statistic.", "So I decided the next benchmark to assess \u2018luck\u2019 would be \u201cActual Goal Difference minus Expected Goal Difference\u201d.", "The idea behind it is simple:", "With this clear, we can begin the analysis.", "Step 1: Create a column labelled \u201cActual Goal Difference minus Expected Goal Difference\u201d. This reflects the degree to which a team under or over performed the goal difference expectation in each match.", "Bear in mind that the dataset does not give us goal difference and expected goal difference directly. These must be derived from (1) Goals Scored, (2) Goals Conceded, (3) Expected Goals Scored (xG), (4) Expected Goals Conceded (xGA), in the following manner: (scored-conceded) \u2014 (xG-xGA)", "Step 2: Derive the mean and the sum for each team", "This approach tells a similar story to the \u201cPoints minus Expected Points\u201d approach, with Liverpool still near the top in these standings. Over the course of the season, Liverpool significantly outperformed its expected goal difference.", "One peculiarity here though, was Leicester. I didn\u2019t remember them having a particularly remarkable season, so why were they so far ahead on this metric?", "It was clear that there was one match in particular that really skewed the data. This was the 9\u20130 win they had over Southampton \u2014 the largest ever away win in the history of English top-flight football. The \u2018Actual Goal Diff \u2014 Expected Goal Diff\u2019 for this match was a whopping 5.07.", "The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them, we imbue them with meaning. \u2014 Nate Silver", "So after all this analysis, did we have an answer as to whether Liverpool were \u201clucky\u201d? At first glance, this seems to be the case. Leicester notwithstanding, Liverpool is ahead of the competition in the relevant \u2018luck\u2019 metrics.", "However, if we dug a little deeper, it is actually clear that these \u2018luck\u2019 metrics do not necessarily reflect random chance. Both of the generated benchmarks, \u2018Points minus Expected Points\u2019 and \u2018Goal Diff minus Expected Goal Diff\u2019, rely heavily on the Expected Goals scored (xG) and Expected Goals conceded (xGA) statistics. While luck certainly affects deviation from xG and xGA, other factors come into play as well.", "For instance, if a team generates relatively few quality chances (low xG), but manages to score plenty of goals (high actual goals), this could be explained by luck, but it could also be explained by a team simply having great strikers that convert at an excellent rate.", "The converse is also true \u2014 if a team allows its opponents plenty of quality chances (high xGA) but does not actually concede that many (low goals conceded), again, this could be explained by luck, but it could also be explained by a team having incredible defending or a world class keeper that prevents actual goals being conceded.", "So if the data doesn\u2019t tell us that Liverpool was lucky, what reasonable conclusion can we try to derive from it?", "For me, the analysis showed that Liverpool, over the course of the 2019\u20132020 season, did not create a massive amount of \u2018good quality\u2019 chances or uniquely stifled its opposition.", "This appears to be consistent with the eye-test \u2014 when I actually watched Liverpool play across this season, I remember that there were plenty of grinded-out wins. It was not very often that Liverpool were blowing its opponents off the pitch by creating plenty of quality chances.", "However, just from the data alone, it is difficult to conclude what combination of luck, great finishing or great shot-stopping gave Liverpool the title.", "I hope you enjoyed this! Feel free to leave comments. I would also love any suggestions on interesting datasets I could work with in the future!", "Your home for data science.
