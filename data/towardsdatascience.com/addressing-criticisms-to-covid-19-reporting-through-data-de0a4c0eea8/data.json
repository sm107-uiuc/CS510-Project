Most of us have anticipated a second lockdown in some form after the relative frivolities of the summer, so few will be surprised by Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement to re-introduce certain limitations in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Looking at the alarming rate at which reported positive cases are increasing, this seems like an obvious decision, too:", "With the ensuing public concern came a rising sense of skepticism about the reported numbers. Several outlets, including the BBC, have called into question the reliability of these figures, driven by the observation that neither hospital admissions nor COVID-related mortality have increased at anywhere near the rate of reported positive cases:", "While all of the challenges laid out by these outlets may not be valid, they do highlight a number of glaring issues with the way these figures are reported and, more importantly, interpreted by the public and seemingly the government. In the next few minutes I attempt to highlight a few of these and offer ways to put these numbers into a different perspective.", "Before I begin, I want to highlight that I\u2019m not a doctor, an epidemiologist, a medical biologist, a health minister, a policy advisor, an economist, a utilitarian philosopher. These calculations should be taken with the biggest pinch of salt and certainly not used to support any agenda. I do believe however, that if policy decisions are made based on data, the data should be scrutinised wherever possible.", "I\u2019m going to explore three areas of concern regarding the reporting of positive cases, but before we dive into that, it\u2019s worth providing a bit of context on how testing is conducted in the UK.", "Testing is currently carried out in 4 ways (pillars). These are:", "Pillars 1, 2 and 4 are all PCR swab tests carried out under different circumstances; pillar 3 is the odd one out, being a serological antibody test. Pillar 2 tests are carried out through a commercial contractor, at mobile testing sites or through kits delivered to people\u2019s homes. Incidentally, Pillar 2 testing has seen a significant increase in recent months as the government is ramping up its testing programme (rightly so). This leads us to the first issue.", "Keen observers will have clicked away from the daily case counts on gov.uk and wandered onto the charts showing the number of tests carried by pillar:", "While most pillars have remained fairly consistent, pillar 2 testing (darkest blue) has seen a significant jump in activity since August, particularly pronounced in September.", "The issue with this should be obvious: the more you test, the more cases you will find. The science behind this is pretty intuitive; at least some of the increase in positive cases will be explained by the simple fact that more of these home kits were made available and used.", "A more subtle complication of these figures comes not from how many people are tested, but how much we can trust those tests. Medical tests are not perfect, and how much you can be sure of your diagnosis depends heavily on their predictive power. Much like classification algorithms, diagnostic tools in medicine have sensitivity and specificity. To understand them in the context of COVID, it\u2019s useful to look at them in isolation at first.", "Sensitivity gives us the probability that an individual who definitely has Coronavirus will be diagnosed as such. If we were to test 10 people who definitely have the virus with a test with 60% sensitivity, the results (on average) would return 6 positive cases and 4 negative cases:", "Specificity, on the other hand, is the probability that a healthy person is identified correctly with a negative diagnosis. If 10 healthy people were tested with a kit with 60% specificity, the results would return 6 negatives and 4 positives, on average:", "We can illustrate the effect of specificity in the context of mass testing with slightly higher numbers. Suppose we have 100 people, 10 of whom definitely have the virus, and 90 of whom don\u2019t. What would a 100% sensitivity, 90% specificity test give in this case?", "The test has 100% sensitivity, therefore it correctly identifies all 10 of the truly infected people directly. However, the 90% sensitivity means that only 90% of the remaining 90 negatives are correctly diagnosed, leaving a surplus of 9 people testing positive when they did not in fact have the virus.", "This is another key page in the sceptics\u2019 book; if specificity (or rather 1-specificity) is significantly higher than the actual prevalence of the virus, more testing will only muddy the waters and inherently increase the number of positive test cases. The actual sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests are somewhere between 60\u201385% and 94\u201399%, respectively, depending on which (small sample sized) study you consult.", "Regardless, specificity and sensitivity should (and do) play a part in estimates of true prevalence, which we\u2019ll explore in the next section.", "But first, I want to point out something a bit more nuanced; the circumstances under which testing is conducted matter a lot for how much we can rely on its results. Surely, tests carried out by professionals in hospitals (where repeat testing is available to reduce uncertainty, for example) should have a greater significance than take-home kits, where people do their own swabbing and the risk of contamination is far higher.", "Interestingly, despite these factors suggesting a higher positive rate in hospital-based Pillar 1 tests, the opposite is true in reality:", "Since June, the chance to test positive has decreased in hospitals and stayed relatively constant for take-home kits until both started increasing again in September, by which time you were 4\u20135 times more likely to test positive at home than in a hospital.", "There could be a number of explanations for this, but I can only guess (not an expert, remember?)\u200a\u2014\u200ait could be a combination of contamination and a difference in demographics, for example. Pillar 2 tests are used in care homes a lot, which have been known for localised mass infections, but they\u2019re also used by the general public, presumably before travelling or working. Pillar 1 tests on the other hand are used for, well, patients and those in medical need. Another key difference is that Pillar 2 tests are processed by a commercial contractor, so there could be a difference in methodologies involved.", "In any case, such systematic discrepancies should be highlighted especially when these positive cases are reported together.", "In the final section of the article I will demonstrate some methods to address the issues I\u2019ve outlined above. In the interest of brevity I will not be sharing in-line code snippets, but I will make my notebook available for anyone to peruse.", "I will be using 15 weeks\u2019 worth of Pillar 1&2 test results in England between 28 May and 9 September, published on gov.uk. The data provides weekly totals of tests carried out and positive test cases, by pillar. Taking a quick look at the positive case totals shows us the familiar upward curve:", "My job here will be to:", "The idea that your medical tests are not 100% accurate is not exactly a novel one. Owing to this, a pretty simple formula has been derived as presented by Lewis & Torgerson (2012):", "Where P_t is the true prevalence of the disease in the population, P_a is the apparent prevalence, and S_e and S_p are the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, respectively. Note that we have 3 unknowns here, the data only provides us with the apparent prevalence. Given that P_a is the probability of obtaining a positive test result, our observations (test results) will follow the binomial distribution:", "P_a is parametrised by 3 unknowns, P_t, S_e, S_p \u2014 none of which we know with certainty. To solve this, I will use Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to draw random values of the parameters given prior distributions for them, comparing the results to the probability above given by the binomial PDF. My posterior for P_t should then converge around the real prevalence, given the test results.", "We briefly talked about the approximate sensitivities and specificities of PCR swab tests; the results for these vary wildly depending on a number of factors, such as demographic, geography, disease stage and time of study. Zhang & Du (2020) have pooled a number of these results together and presented estimated probability distributions for both sensitivity and specificity, from which I\u2019ve taken inspiration to construct my Beta priors:", "Which gives means of 0.821 and 0.983, respectively for the sensitivity and specificity of both Pillar 1 and 2 swab tests, but doubles the variance of Pillar 2 sensitivity to represent higher uncertainty of the home kits\u2019 ability to correctly detect the virus.", "This is where things get more difficult. COVID is a pandemic, therefore its prevalence will change week by week, community to community, demographic to demographic, so using research from overseas won\u2019t be very effective here. The ideal data set would come from Pillar 4 testing, which was set up for this exact purpose. Sadly, the UK government does not publish the results (and it recently refused a Freedom of Information request to do so).", "For lack of good data, my best bet is to initially believe what the results tell me and construct my Beta priors with means corresponding to the apparent prevalence on that week (scaling my parameters somewhat arbitrarily to represent my confidence in the results):", "I can plot my priors for the true prevalence for the week commencing September 3:", "We can draw random samples from our 3 prior distributions (for both Pillars 1 and 2) to estimate our apparent prevalence as per our equation from before. We can then compare that to our observed data and assess how likely those samples are to arise given the binomial distribution of our apparent prevalence, and construct posterior distributions.", "After 10,000 samples drawn, our posteriors for Pillar 1 look like this:", "Sensitivity and specificity have roughly remained constant, our estimate for the true prevalence of Pillar 1 testing has converged around a lower mean (0.006 down from 0.010).", "Again, test accuracy metrics remain relatively consistent, whilst prevalence drops from 0.040 to 0.031.", "We can repeat the above process for our individual weekly observations, recreating the prior construction exercise based on our data. This allows us to plot the estimated prevalence against the reported one; I\u2019ve included the 94% highest posterior density values as pseudo confidence intervals on the plots:", "We observe that the estimated mean prevalence is consistently lower than the reported prevalence for both Pillars, however, the reported prevalence does fall within the 94% HPD range.", "We can also construct estimates of total cases by pillar by scaling up the prevalence estimates by the total tests carried out, essentially giving us how many individuals we believe were truly infected from those tested:", "Finally, we can combine estimates of Pillar 1 & 2 cases to compare it with the reported total cases:", "I\u2019ve outlined a number of challenges raised with regards to COVID-19 reporting in the UK, and I\u2019ve offered some ways to address them, demonstrating their effects given the data that is publicly available, specifically accounting for estimated specificity and sensitivity of PCR tests, looked at estimating the prevalence instead of total cases (removing testing volumes from consideration), and treated the two Pillars separately. What did this tell us?", "In the population that was tested, that is. Given that our knowledge of PCR test accuracy is about right, and our priors are fairly representative, the actual positive cases may be lower than what\u2019s been reported for Pillars 1 & 2. Having said that, even the reduced estimated prevalence would mean a much higher actual number of positive cases across the country, if we were to scale up to the UK\u2019s population, so it\u2019s probably no reason to start relaxing.", "In an ideal world we could arrive at better estimates of true prevalence with Pillar 4 test results, however the estimated (and reported) prevalence shows that even if we adjust for the number of tests carried out we still observe a relatively sharp rise in positive cases starting in September. While availability of pillar-specific data only allowed us to model up to September 9, it is reasonable to assume that the trend continues thereafter, looking at the total reported cases.", "We\u2019ve been able to address some of the challenges raised by skeptics and offer data-driven solutions to them. While our analysis showed an overall lower number of cases were likely to have been truly detected, we can\u2019t disprove a sudden increase in prevalence. Hospital admissions may still be low relative to positive cases, but it is probably prudent to remain cautious in our new world, lest we find ourselves in a situation where we simply can\u2019t treat our ill for lack of capacity.", "Did I do something wrong? Could I have done something better? Did I do something well?", "Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn; I\u2019m always happy to be challenged or just have a chat if you\u2019re interested in my work.", "If you want to play with the code yourself, please follow the link to my Google Colab notebook:", "Your home for data science.
