Though they were incorrect in thinking the world would end in 2012 due to solar flares and other cosmic abnormalities, they did accurately hypothesize mass chaos in the early 21st century. The predicted cause of said mass chaos, however, couldn\u2019t have been further from reality.", "Jumping back to reality, it\u2019s time we talk about the impending apocalypse of the software world \u2014 the death of Python 2.7. For those that are unaware, the most popular version of Python will reach its end-of-life date on January 1, 2020. What does end-of-life mean you say? When a Python version (this applies to other forms of software as well) reaches this milestone, the developers agree to end all future development work for that specific branch, even if major security issues are identified.", "Why should this matter? Python 2.7 was released nearly a decade ago, so surely it reaps the benefits of being a hardened release without any bugs or vulnerabilities, right? Well, not quite\u2026 Despite its long tenure, new bugs and issues are still cropping up on the official Python issue tracker to this day. Come January, no further updates will be released if another issue is identified, potentially leaving code vulnerable indefinitely.", "Perhaps you don\u2019t access databases, manipulate mission-critical data, or expose user injections in your code. Instead, you have an innocent data science project that simply makes predictions or runs analysis and you don\u2019t care about these vulnerabilities? Even code that is \u201cimmune\u201d to security issues can still suffer from the end of Python 2.7 as many popular libraries are continually dropping support for that version.", "As you can see in the Projects Timeline on the Python 2 sunsetting page, most of the top Python packages are planning on dropping support by January 2020, with several already exclusive to Python 3. Among these packages are several crucial data science libraries, such as Scipy, scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Even if we make a [false] assumption that these packages will never encounter security issues, they are always being updated to increase performance, improve the APIs, and add useful new features. Any code that sticks with Python 2.7 will miss out on these vital updates.", "Why doesn\u2019t everyone just upgrade to Python 3 and move on with their lives then? Unfortunately, Python 2 and Python 3 aren\u2019t natively compatible, and code that works in Python 2 won\u2019t necessarily work with Python 3. This has been one of the biggest barriers to entry for most developers as the transition to the latest version of Python would potentially require a complete rework of the code which is undesirable at best.", "Over the past few years, many OS vendors have attempted to help kill-off Python 2.7 by installing a newer version of Python system-wide in-place of the dated iteration. While this move by vendors should be applauded, many developers and users are finding their Python projects which have worked seamlessly for years are suddenly broken after an OS upgrade due to the different default version of the language.", "In summary, all good things in this world must come to an end, even the infamous Python 2.7. With this end, however, comes the potential for destruction as several programs will no longer work on newer systems. Additionally, patches for any vulnerabilities will be absent, new features will be forgotten, and support will be given the coldest of shoulders. This grim future can be preemptively avoided, however, by ensuring your projects are up-to-date and future-proof.", "With the doom-and-gloom out of the way, what should you do today to see how you will be affected by the end of Python 2.7? The first step is to run a very simple Python command which will tell you everything you need to know:", "Assuming no errors were thrown, the command above will list the default version of Python your system is using, such as 2.7.15 or 3.7.3. If the command returns 3.something and all of your existing code works as expected, then you are good to go and can move on with your happy life, enjoying the wonderful new updates to Python 3! If, however, you see 2.7.something (or worse, 2.6 or lower), I highly recommend taking a further dive into your system and determine if your development environment is at-risk of future maintenance headaches and vulnerabilities.", "Now, just because the system reports version 2.7 or similar, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s the version your Python programs are using. For example, if you are using virtual environments or Anaconda to localize your Python executable, you might still be ok if you are using a newer version of the language for all of your projects. If any of these projects are still pointing at old versions of Python, then it would be wise to work on upgrading the system (more on that below).", "If virtual environments and Anaconda are meaningless to you, then you are likely just using the default version of Python which came with the OS. If that\u2019s the case, then I highly recommend working on updating your environment, either locally to a project, or globally.", "If you\u2019re still reading this, you are likely using an older version of Python and are looking for help on upgrading. I recommend the following general steps to update to the latest and greatest:", "Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into each step!", "There are a few different options to actually install the latest version of Python on your system. A couple of these include using virtual project localization, such as Anaconda and virtual environments. The official Anaconda documentation has a great guide on installing and using it here.", "Virtual environments can also be installed using the following guide, but note that you will need to download and install the desired version of Python to your system first. More information on downloading and installing Python can be found here.", "Of course, you can choose to simply install a newer version of Python system-wide and forget about project localization, though I recommend using one of the above methods to ensure dependencies are specific to each project.", "Another option is to use Docker containers and run the application inside a custom Python container. While I love containerizing projects, it might not necessarily be the easiest or most logical and practical solution.", "Since many Python packages are beginning to drop support for 2.7, it\u2019s entirely possible that a project expects older versions of dependent packages to function properly. If your project\u2019s dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file in the directory (which I would strongly recommend doing if they aren\u2019t already), it would be wise to examine all of the listed packages and attempt to upgrade them if possible. This ensures your dependencies stay up-to-date with the latest version of Python, even if everything appeared current with Python 2.", "Luckily, there isn\u2019t too much of a difference between the Python 2 and 3 code-bases, but certain commands can make working code instantly fail on newer versions. One of the biggest examples is the print command. With Python 2, print is a special statement, allowing us to write", "The behavior changed with Python 3. The print statement is now an actual function, so that same print statement above must now be written as", "Another important issue is the handling of division for integers. In Python 2, dividing two integers will always return an integer. For example", "Despite the correct answer being 1.5, Python 2 sees this as an integer divided by an integer equals an integer, hence 1.", "Python 3, however, returns a float if applicable in this situation. The same statement would evaluate to", "This can have a very significant impact on results, especially for data science projects that rely on mathematical operations.", "While these are just a few of many deltas between versions 2 and 3, they are generally the biggest culprit for errors after an upgrade. A list of some of the other major differences from a usage standpoint can be found in this blog post.", "Fortunately for us, some useful tools were created to aid the transition from 2 to 3. One such tool is the aptly named 2to3 which comes with most Python installations. Running this program on a particular file will output the changes that need to be made for it to be compatible with Python 3. While this program is a valuable resource for converting code, it isn\u2019t perfect, so I recommend reviewing the changes to ensure everything is logical and a necessary update.", "Once Python and the program\u2019s dependencies have been updated along with the code, it\u2019s time to test the changes to ensure everything works as expected for the newer version. Hopefully your project contains tests of some sort (if not, I highly recommend writing unit tests at the very least to ensure your code works as expected) which you can run with Python 3 to validate the code.", "After running a testing suite (if applicable), run some live tests that would simulate a production use-case. Hopefully this production test traverses through most (if not all) of the code base to verify everything works as expected without issue. If all looks rosy, your code is [likely] ready for prime-time!", "If you made it this far, congratulations! You should have successfully converted your project from Python 2 to 3 and ensured that your code is future-proof. At this point, it is probably safe to push the changes to production environments, update any upstream repositories, and verify all development environments are using the latest version of Python. Your code should now be able to take advantage of the vast number of improvements Python 3 offers over its predecessor, while also creating a stable code-base that will be supported for many more years to come.", "If you followed all of the steps above, you should now solely be using Python 3 for your projects. As mentioned throughout the article, failure to upgrade brings the potential of issues moving forward. Sometimes upgrading isn\u2019t always possible, such as the case of production systems requiring a particular OS or system-wide Python version. A couple different solutions would be to use virtual environments or Anaconda to install a different version of Python, or containerize the application with Docker so it will use the expected version of Python, regardless of which OS you are running on.", "There\u2019s no telling what will happen over the next several months as the end of 2.7 approaches. By proactively updating your project, you can avoid any potential pitfalls after the milestone.", "2.7 was the first version used by many Python developers around the world and has been a major vessel for the explosion in deep and machine learning projects over the past few years. But, even as the greatest of fires die off after time, so too do beasts of the software world. Thanks for the memories 2.7.
