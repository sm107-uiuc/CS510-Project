The system is also able to assess and rank candidates over multiple skill dimensions, to compute an overall score for each candidate per job role.", "Next, we examined the personality traits across industries and profession to find if there is significant difference between them. After establishing this significance, we developed a system to identify the MBTI personality type of job candidates using text analysis. This can be used as a guide for HR to ensure chosen applicants\u2019 personalities fit the role and team they are applying for.", "Lastly, we used attrition data to identify certain personal information which may help in selecting candidates who are less likely to leave the company. These can be used as a flagging mechanism to raise alerts to HR personnel if a candidate have certain information which are significant in predicting attrition.", "If you wish to view a concise slide deck on this report, head to https://medium.com/@phoechuanbin/meddling-with-hr-automation-slides-4db88eadb99c", "Today, sending a resume is near effortless. For instance Google, one of the Big Four tech companies many aspiring computer science students wish to work for, receives more than 20,000 to a record of 70,000 resumes a week. (Eddie J., 2014)", "On the contrary, a human resource\u2019s (HR) job is not easy. They have many duties such as handling of employee\u2019s payroll, training and etc., one of which includes looking through thousands of such resumes. To exacerbate the problem, the HR may also be less conversant and familiar with the job titles and roles in a diverse pool of a well-functioning company.", "Furthermore, the right person for a job should not be simply about having the best qualification. Personalities and psycho-emotional traits have been very telling customarily about an employee\u2019s fit and ability to thrive in an organisation\u2019s work culture.", "Lastly, employee retention is a pervasive yet prevalent issue for HR. Employees are analogous to resource, and losing employees is equivalent to losing the time, resources, and money in hiring and training the employee.", "Hence, HR analytics are on the rise to solve these issues as communicated. The ability to tap into analytics can significantly free up resources in HR by categorizing, sorting and storing unstructured information, and manage employees in a less-bias, data-driven way.", "Our team has designed a 3-stage program to deal with the problems of acquiring qualified talents, filtering for the best-fit candidate via psycho-emotional traits, and lastly retaining employees through finding significant variables of attrition rates.", "Manually sorting resumes using traditional human labour is not only resource-intensive, it is also susceptible to human biases and errors. A famous study conducted by Marianne and Sendhil in 2003 studied the employability of candidates with either the names of Emily and Greg, or Lakisha and Jamal, ceteris paribus (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003). The outcome was that \u201cwhite-sounding names\u201d received 50% more callbacks than \u201cblack-sounding names\u201d.", "Thus, our team has designed a 3-step data-driven model we believe can help HR departments rank resumes more objectively, according to its suitability to the role applied. This can act as a primary filter for poor-matching resumes. Figure 1.1 describes this model.", "Firstly, we believe the best way to obtain the most important skills for a given job role, is to seek from the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d. By web-scraping numerous job-descriptions (JDs) from various organisations which highlights the essential job requirements for the role, we would obtain the most salient skills generally demanded by the industry.", "Secondly, after obtaining hundreds of JDs, we can create a database of tokens through tokenization for a given job role and clean it before performing NLP. Stop words are removed and the bag-of-words (BOW) model is applied, so the order of words will not matter. We performed a general, unstructured text analysis first, and subsequently, a targeted analysis. The former is akin to unsupervised learning, as we attempt to look for unknown patterns in a dataset of tokens. The latter aims to give a \u201cscore\u201d for its prevalence in each predetermined list of skills.", "Thirdly, by applying a ranking-algorithm with the scoring as devised previously, candidates can be ranked numerically according to the relevance of their individual skill dimensions or as a whole to the job applied.", "Our team has scraped JDs of \u201cData Scientist\u201d (DS), \u201cData Analyst\u201d (DA), and \u201cData Engineer\u201d (DE) from Indeed, an employment-related search engine for job listings. In their terms of service, Indeed has allowed web-scraping.", "As the raw text are scraped from the web pages, pre-processing is required before any analysis. We treated each dataset equivalently by:", "Firstly, we tokenize each dataset as bigrams (2 words as 1 token) as this makes meaningful contextual sense for terms such as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, and \u201cdata science\u201d.", "Before any meaningful analysis can be performed, data cleaning has to be done. To begin, we separate the bigrams into individual words while retaining its structural integrity. Next, we filter commonly-used stop words from \u201ctidytext\u201d package. These words are often used in languages to make sentences flow, but are usually nonsubstantive and rarely adds meaning. This step saw the most consequential reduction in our token-size in all datasets by approximately two-thirds. (Appendix 1A)", "Afterwards, we removed words with frequency = 1 in the dataset. In our case, these includes less meaningful terms such as \u201caaa\u201d, or incorrectly parsed terms such as \u201cabilitiesstrong\u201d. Therefore, they are not substantial.", "To clean incorrectly-processed words, we filtered tokens with high character number (e.g. \u201cmanufacturinglocationsingaporecontract\u201d) via trial and error. However, we understand that this may damage our data. We stop the process as soon as the majority of the top 50 character count tokens are deemed valid or comprehensible.", "We move on by lemmatizing our tokens utilising the \u201ctextstem\u201d package. Lemmatizing, as opposed to stemming, aims at returning the base form of a word whereas stemming is a more crude process by merely chopping off the ends of words. For example, if confronted with the token \u201cponies\u201d, lemmatization would return \u201cpony\u201d while stemming returns \u201cponi\u201d.", "The higher the proportion of a word in a dataset, we can assume the greater the relevance of a token in the particular job role.", "However, we realise that DS has many technical jargons such as \u201cdata scientist\u201d and \u201cmachine learn\u201d, whereas DA has less useful terms such as \u201cmarital status\u201d and \u201csexual orientation\u201d (Appendix 1B). Thus, this method of numerical analysis may not be effective for all job roles in the market, and should only be used for data exploration.", "This observation can be validated through topic-modelling using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model and clustering analysis. Results indicate words can be classified into technical jargon or demographic variables. Analysis can be found in Appendix 1C through 1E. Therefore, it is logical to conduct a targeted analysis using our domain knowledge to gain better insights.", "Unlike the general text analysis, targeted analysis utilises domain knowledge of the skills required in a particular job. In our case, we have identified 4 distinct skill dimensions we believe are relevant. These categories of skills are shown below.", "4 Skill Dimension for DS, DA, DE", "Firstly, our team has scraped a list of approximately 700+ programming languages as listed in Wikipedia which we believe it is the most collectively exhaustive one, despite a few being less prevalent. (Appendix 1F). We acknowledge that tokens such as \u201creason\u201d, \u201cbasic\u201d, and \u201csimple\u201d might be used ambiguously and not strictly for programming languages. However, as these are viable programming languages, we chose to remain prudent and keep them in our analysis.", "Next, we have identified a list of the \u201ctop 14 data-science tools\u201d, such as \u201ctableau\u201d, \u201cscikit-learn\u201d and \u201cexcel\u201d (DataFlair Team, 2019). We believe that although this falls outside the purview of the spectrum of programming languages, it goes hand-in-hand with them and is an imperative element in the IT industry. Similarly, we do note there can be ambiguity in analysing terms with multiple definitions. For example, \u201cexcel\u201d may be interpreted as a data-science tool when it carries the meaning of being superior.", "We then pinpointed 6 broad technical skills relevant in the IT industry, despite the choice of programming languages or tools used (Chandrasekaran, 2018). They are namely \u201cstatistics\u201d, \u201cregression\u201d, \u201cvisualisation\u201d, \u201cdiscovery\u201d, \u201cclassification\u201d, and \u201cextraction\u201d. (Appendix 1H).", "Lastly, we acknowledge that soft skills are relevant and pertinent skills for operating in all industries. Hence, we curated a broad list of terms such as \u201ccommunicate\u201d, \u201cteamwork\u201d, \u201cleadership\u201d, etc. which are designed to be less ambiguous. Our findings are as shown in Appendix 1I.", "Similar to JDs, our team has legally downloaded 20 resumes per job-role (DS, DA, DE) from Indeed. We devised an algorithm to rank these resumes according to the skill dimensions as discussed in section 1.2.4.", "Figure 1.2: Ranking Algorithm for Programming Languages", "Firstly, we created a document-term-matrix for a particular job role. Resumes (documents) are thus laid out as rows, while skills (tokens) are presented as columns. This gives a general and brief feedback of the skills possessed by each candidate (Appendix 1J).", "We propose to capitalize on the characteristics of the logarithmic function for computing scores. The logarithmic function is an inverse function of the exponential function, and is a widely-accepted and convenient way to express large numbers (Jon., 2018). Scores increase at a decreasing rate to accommodate the fact that having higher counts of a term does not value-add to the score linearly. E.g Value of 1 vs 2 counts of \u2018python\u2019 \u2248 Value of 10 counts vs 20 counts of \u2018python\u2019. This also prevents giving disproportionately high scores to resumes that spam relevant keywords.", "Figure 1.3: Graph of scores based on term frequency", "Figure 1.3 shows the 2 equations used to calculate the scores. We cannot simply use the logarithmic equation as log(0) tends to -\u221e.", "If term frequency is 0, the corresponding score is 0 logically. Otherwise, we will use", "to calculate the score. This graph showing how score vary with term frequency is shown in the same figure.", "Each skill is valued differently for different job roles. For instance, the programming language \u201cpython\u201d has a significant mention proportion of 26.2% in JDs of DS, while only having 16.6% for DE. Thus, \u201cpython\u201d should be given a greater weightage for its high mention rates in JDs of DS than in DE. Hence, we propose to multiply the score in step 2 with its corresponding proportion of mention-rates of that keyword.", "We analysed and computed the scorings for each skill dimension (\u201cprogramming languages\u201d, \u201cdata-science tools\u201d, \u201ctechnical skills\u201d, \u201csoft skills\u201d) for each dataset of resume (DS, DA, DE). With these scorings, we can assess an individual\u2019s overall capabilities of meeting the requirements of the applied role.", "Furthermore, by having the score for each dimension, this increases the explainability of why a candidate is better than another. E.g. 2 candidates with the same total score but candidate A has a higher \u201cprogramming language\u201d score, and for this job this dimension is vital. Therefore, candidate A is better fit.", "See Appendix 1V for the compilation of the final results for each dataset and the following appendices for each dataset\u2019s respective dimensions.", "We observed that our predefined lexicon of \u201ctechnical skills\u201d was not widely used in the DA and DE resume datasets, as count ranges between the values of 0 to 1. This could mean that the terms identified are not extensive enough, or the job roles do not require these skills. This also applies intra-dataset. For the soft skills of DE besides the term \u201cresponsibility\u201d, it also has a low overall mention rate. We understand that resumes may not usually contain such words and therefore recommend other documents such as cover letters to be used instead.", "Other noteworthy observations include a significant count of mentions in a resume, specifically \u201cSazid Khan\u2019s Resume\u201d, with 89 counts of the term \u201ctableau\u201d for the data-science tool skills. Upon closer analysis, he had a 6-page long resume which has mentioned the use of the suite of Tableau applications available across his various employments. However, his inflated usage was tempered by both the logarithmic function and lower weightage-score given, and he is ranked 5th in terms of data-science tools in the DE dataset.", "In our final analyses, we assumed that each skill dimension are valued equally. However, the weightage for each skill-dimension can be altered e.g. via opinions of a department\u2019s head, expert opinions, and etc. Similarly, our model currently does not have the capability to assess other pertinent factors such as education level, achievements, previous work experience, extra-curricular activities or hobbies and etc. currently. For instance, to track education levels, we could group terms such as \u201cA-Levels\u201d and \u201cDiploma\u201d as high-school level education, and terms such as \u201cBachelors\u201d and \u201cBSc\u201d as college-level education.", "Our model proposed provides HR a resource-friendly method to convert unstructured resumes of almost any job-roles in the market to a more structured, organisable dataset. With this, HR is able to use a data-driven method to objectively assess candidates in their various skill domains, and better judge who best meet the job requirements for a given role.", "Talent and skills acquisition is only one aspect in driving operational efficiency in the workplace \u2014 an individual\u2019s fit with the work environment is important as well. Studies have shown that employees who fit well in their company\u2019s culture, get-along with coworkers and supervisor had greater overall job satisfaction levels, were more likely to remain in their company, and were more committed to delivering superior job performance (Bouton, 2015).", "In view of this, our team aims to investigate if there are any trends of the same personality type existing in a given industry and/or department. If so, we would subsequently develop a model to sieve out specific personality traits that fit the given industry and/or department. This model can be applied in conjunction after part 1, where individuals are screened if they meet the requirements for the job applied for.", "Using a dataset of 3600 records (personality.csv) of people working in different industries and departments and their respective scores in the Big 5 Personality Test (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) (Gosling et al., 2003) we analysed the hypothesis that departments and industries hire employees with similar personalities.", "Firstly, we need to analyse if the mean personality trait scores are the same across different departments and industries. ANOVA was used to test against our dataset. Below is the null and alternative hypothesis for only extraversion scores (Refer to Appendix 2A for results with other personality traits):", "H0: Mean Extraversion score is the same across different departments/industries", "H1: Mean Extraversion Score is not the same across different departments/industries", "Figure 2.1.1: ANOVA results for Extraversion Score across Departments", "Figure 2.1.2: ANOVA results for Extraversion Score across Industries", "From the ANOVA results shown in figure 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, we can see that both p-value for extraversion scores across departments and across industries are less than 0.05 and are statistically significant. This means that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean extraversion scores between the different departments or different industries are different.", "Figure 2.2.1: Boxplot of Scores for Extraversion across Industries", "Figure 2.2.2: Boxplot of Scores for Extraversion across Departments", "In addition, we plotted a boxplot for visualization purposes. From Figure 2.2.1 and Figure 2.2.2, it can be seen that extraversion score for the dataset differs significantly across industries and departments. For example, in Figure 2.2.1, mean extraversion score, denoted by the red dot, for real estate is significantly higher than that of other industries, especially accounting and IT. This can be due to the fact that in the real estate industry, employees will have to interact and socialise more, so having a high extraversion score would allow them to gain energy from being around people and thus operate more efficiently. This is in contrast to accounting and the IT industry, where interaction between employees and other personnel in the same industry is not as common and thus there is not much value-add for employees with very high extraversion scores. With the low variance in the same figure, it can also be interpreted that most people working in the same industry have very similar extraversion scores. Appendix 2B also shows all the graphs for other personality traits across industries and departments.", "Comparing Figure 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, it can be seen that extraversion score within each department showed a lower variance and revealed less outliers than within each industry. This view can be further supported by our results from ANOVA, shown in Figure 2.1.1 and Figure 2.1.2, which reveals that f-value across departments (1859) is significantly higher than that across industries (670.7). Since f-value reveals the ratio of variance of the group means over mean of the within group variances, it can be concluded that the variance between departments over variance in each individual department is lower than that of variance between industries over variance in each individual industry.", "This implies that hiring employees with similar personality traits within a certain department is more important and accurate than within a certain industry. Such observation is because employees in an industry can work in contrasting departments, where departments will determine their job scopes and thus require a certain personality trait. Industry is not the determining factor for employees with certain traits. Hence, departmental personality traits should be prioritised over traits based on industries, although the latter is still of importance.", "Fig 2.3: Relationship between industry, department and team", "It should not be forgotten that personality fit of employees with their coworkers and supervisors are equally important, since employees primarily interact with those mentioned. Only when a good relationship is established between these parties, then operational efficiency will be maximised as there will be high relationship satisfaction.", "To ensure that people hired fits the department, we will have to first be able to determine the personality type of the applicant. One option is to get every applicant to go through a standardised MBTI testing. However, this can be an extremely time consuming and costly and may not be suitable for all companies. Moreover, applicants may \u201cgame\u201d these personality tests to fit the role that they are applying for to increase their chances of being hired. Our goal is to assess candidates personalities using easily available textual data, such as cover letter, without adding much complexity to the recruiting process.", "Through text analysis, we will be able to determine the personality type of an applicant through the cover letter they submitted when they applied for the job. This serves as a guide to determine whether they are suitable for a specific department.", "As an improvement, we can use the same method to analyse the user\u2019s social networks for higher accuracy as it is a less formal form of textual data and the ability for the applicant to \u201cgame\u201d the system is also lower. We will use textual data from cover letters below.", "Fig 2.4: Steps for text analysis", "We will split MBTI into its 4 dimensions and develop a psychological lexicon that corresponds with them. This lexicon is used to detect the usage of dimension-related words in their cover letter.", "In order to develop the full psychological lexicon, an in-depth psychology research on the type of words used by people of different personality types have to be done. For the purpose of simplifying our model, we will be using a psychological lexicon consisting of simple descriptive words that applicants use to describe themselves (e.g. person with high Extraversion using \u201csociable\u201d to describe themselves).", "The sum of term frequencies will be assigned to individual dimensions, as stipulated by our psychological lexicon, when these words are detected in the cover letter. Using the tabulated scores, we will be able to determine whether the applicant is high or low in the different dimensions of MBTI.", "The repeated use of keywords in the cover letter is mitigated using the same logarithmic function in 1.3.1 to accurately reflect the value of each occurrence of a term.", "We performed text analysis for 5 different sample CVs to find out the different personality types of the applicants.", "Using our model, there will be a few pointers to take note:", "If the value is positive, it will mean \u201cIntroversion (I)\u201d, \u201cIntuition (N)\u201d, \u201cThinking (T)\u201d and \u201cJudging (J)\u201d in their respective columns.", "If the value is negative, it will mean \u201cExtroversion (E)\u201d, \u201cSensing (S)\u201d, \u201cFeeling (F)\u201d and \u201cPerceiving (P)\u201d in their respective columns.", "From the results in the table above, we are able to deduce the MBTI personality type of the 5 different applicants from their CV. As observed, the personality type for applicant of CV_1 is ENFJ, CV_2 is ESTJ, CV_3 is ENFJ, CV_4 is ESTJ and CV_5 is ESTP. Using these MBTI, hiring managers and HR personnel can use it as a guide to aid their recruiting process.", "For example, a sales department looking out for applicants who possess the personality type of ESTJ as they believe that they will require someone who is outspoken, have a good sense of people, able to think critically and possess a good judgement on things to be a successful salesperson. In this case, CV_2 and CV_4 will be more suitable.", "Fig 2.6: Introversion and Extraversion Result", "Next, the sales department can look further into traits that they deem to be more important. They may select extraversion as salespeople are required to meet many clients throughout the day and the ability to build rapport with clients is essential. So, they may look into the extraversion score of the 2 selected CVs. From the results above, we can observe that the applicant using CV_4 have the highest extraversion score and his personality fits what the department is looking for.", "However, we acknowledge that it is hard to quantify personality traits, let alone rank them, especially if the input data and lexicon used is not robust and extensive. The derived personality types should serve as guides rather than scores. Therefore, we recommend the use of social network data and to develop an extensive lexicon for this purpose. Also, this can be further extended to the Big 5 personality model too.", "This extensive lexicon should account for valence shifters, which are words that change or intensify the meaning of polarised words (Open Data Science, 2018). This includes negators such as the word \u201cnot\u201d. Simply matching words with the psychological lexicon to calculate the personality is too reductive as it may remove or mutate essential information in the textual data.", "Using our text mining model, if \u201cnot sociable\u201d is found, the primitive model will just flag \u201csociable\u201d as a positive term for extraversion. However, with the presence of valence shifters, we know that the meaning of the word has been changed and the term should be flagged as a negative term instead. The psychological lexicon can be developed to include \u201cSentence Level\u201d text analysis as it will give a better representation of the meaning of the words when taking into account the presence of valence shifters.", "Using the above method, we are able to find the personality type of candidates using easily obtainable textual data. HR can then ensure that the selected applicants fits what the department is looking for by looking at their traits, ensuring that the most suitable applicants are being chosen.", "When hiring new employees, one of the factors employers may look out for is their likelihood of staying in the company. Hence, this section of our report will focus on attrition rate of employees.", "Attrition refers to the voluntary reduction of employees, through resignation and retirement, who are then not replaced. There are multiple negative impacts for a company with a high attrition rate. Firstly, there will be a direct impact on company profitability due to lost productivity and increase in hiring and training expenses. High attrition rate may also result in low workplace morale as current employees may be overworked while new employees have increased difficulties adapting to the company. This would lead to a fall in employee productivity and company revenue (Markovich, 2019). Hence, in order to reduce the increase in hiring and training expenses, as well as mitigate revenue losses, it is important to hire employees with low likelihood of attrition.", "There are 2 broad methods to reducing employee attrition: retention of current employees and hiring of employees with a lower probability of attrition. The second method will be focused on in this analysis.

However, employers should not prioritise filtering employees by age to prevent age discrimination in the workplace.", "For the majority, time spent wasted on travelling to and fro work is an avoidable daily occurrence. However, long hours of commuting is associated with increased absenteeism and lateness, as well as increased resentment at work and inability to perform to the same standards as those who live in much closer proximity to the workplace (Durhan, 2019). Researchers in England have found that an additional 20 minutes of commuting to and fro work per day has the same negative effect as receiving a 19% pay cut (Loudenback, 2017). Hence, it is no surprise that there is a significant relationship between distance from home and environment satisfaction. Employee attrition is hence more likely with a longer work commute time.", "Thus, a possible factor employers may look for in applicants is a shorter distance from home. However, it is important to note that there are other solutions to this problem, such as making working hours more flexible, as it may not be practical or beneficial to the company to rank employees by distance from home. Furthermore, in a small country like Singapore with a well-established, efficient public transport system, difference in commute time between employees may not be as significant.", "Job satisfaction typically measures workers\u2019 contentedness with individual aspects of their job, such as nature or scope of the job. Relationship satisfaction measures workers\u2019 relationships with their colleagues and supervisors. According to our results, PercentSalaryHike, TrainingTimesLastYear, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion and YearsWithCurrManager are the variables significant in determining both JobSatisfaction and RelationshipSatisfaction. There are also other variables not included in the dataset that could possibly be important and significant, but will not be further discussed. However, most of these variables are not relevant when hiring new employees, hence they will not be further explored. Instead, the company could make use of these variables in improving job and relationship satisfaction of current employees, to improve retention of current employees. Only YearsInCurrentRole may be relevant in resumes.", "Years in current role is a variable that is important in determining all 3 satisfaction measures. An employee who has worked in his current role for a long period of time shows that he is more likely to be satisfied with his current role. Hence, employers can screen applicants applying for the same role as their previous jobs to find out the number of years they have worked in the particular role. Applicants with a greater number of years is likely to have higher employee satisfaction and thus lower probability of attrition, hence employers can consider prioritising these applicants.", "Job involvement refers to the psychological and emotional extent to which someone participates in his work. Work life balance describes the balance an individual has between his work and other aspects of life. These 2 variables had results which deviated from our expected findings. These 2 variables were expected to be significant in determining job satisfaction but our findings did not support this. Other data sources could be used to further analyse this relationship. Nonetheless, they are still important in predicting attrition. However, as these factors are not relevant in resumes, companies can use them to improve current employee retention instead.", "Employers can make use of the variables discussed above to rank candidates based on their likelihood of attrition. Through these measures, overall attrition rate of the company may be reduced, which would lead to reduction in wastage of resources spent on hiring and training of new staff, as well as increase in overall profitability of the company.", "There are many other variables that could be useful to employers in filtering out applicants with high attrition probability that were not included in this dataset and hence were not analysed. These external factors could be further researched and evaluated upon for their significance in predicting attrition and their usefulness as a filtering mechanism for employers.", "A possible improvement to this analysis would be to split the dataset by department and analyse each department separately, in order to account for possible social and cultural differences that may arise between different departments.", "Another way to reduce employee attrition could be through improving retention of current employees. Some of the variables mentioned above are significant in predicting attrition but are difficult to use to filter applicants. Instead the company can consider using these factors to improve retention of current employees. Further analysis and research on these strategies can be done. By implementing both methods of improving retention of current employees and hiring new employees with lower probability of attrition, the company is more likely to see a significant reduction in employee attrition.", "Bertrand, M., & Mullainathan, S.

LDA identifies inherent, distinct topics and classify words into distinct categories. In our case, we have merged the DS, DA, DE dataset together and applied LDA.
