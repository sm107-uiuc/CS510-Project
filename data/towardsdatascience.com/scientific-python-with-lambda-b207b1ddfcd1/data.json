This makes sense, as Python is a dynamic and easy to understand programming language with a significant ecosystem residing under its belt. Despite Python\u2019s ability to fill this role, however, Python was not designed for scientific computing or even statistics. As a result, Python\u2019s syntax tends to differ a lot when compared with other scientific programming languages.", "While there are numerous examples of how Python might not be a great language for applied mathematics syntactically, Python does have some interesting and exciting tricks up its sleeve to counteract this natural disadvantage. One of the coolest functions in this regard is the lambda function.", "One thing that has endeared me about the Julia programming language is the use of syntactical expressions. Using these expressions in the Julia language allows you to dispatch different types to different operations very easily in one line. This makes mathematical expressions incredibly simple and written like they are in the papers. One thing that this is great for, for example, is differential equations, especially with integration. Although the Julia implementation is certainly better in my opinion, the lambda function in Python can be thought of as an equivalent. If you would like to read up on the Julia implementation, as well, here is an article all about it:", "The lambda function is an anonymous function that takes a Pythonic expression as a parameter. A great way to think of lambda is as application. Whenever lambda is used, it typically means we want to apply this expression to this constructed type. Lambda can also be used to map data, and can be incredibly valuable in for loops.", "In Python, the lambda function is used to create a Pythonic expression without meta-parsing. This is great because it also means that we avoid the dangers typically associated with executing random lines of code \u2014 especially in Python. This expression, however, can also be returned to a variable and defined in the runtime environment as a function.", "The lambda function can be used similarly to a dictionary key. Think of the key as the provided variable or parameter, and the data under the key as the expression to evaluate when the key is called.", "The expression we want to evaluate with x is [z + 5 for z in x]. In this loop we are simply adding five to each element of the list x. Whenever we put x before the colon, lambda x : , we are stating that these are the parameters that will be provided to perform the expression. Finally, we set f equal to the return of the lambda function \u2014 which is going to be a function that takes the parameter x and performs the arithmetic [z + 5 for z in x]. That being said, f is now defined as that function:", "Furthermore, we could create a function with lambda with multiple parameters. The following function will add the two lists together element-wise:", "Ultimately, in the comparison with my favorite programming language, Python\u2019s lambda function essentially fills the same role as dispatch for quickly creating functions in one line of code. Despite this, I thought it might be exciting to draw a quick comparison between the code. Let\u2019s create a normal distribution using both methods in both languages and see which one is more effective:", "From these two examples, its clear that there are very few differences between the applications of this methodology in both languages. However, one significant advantage of the Julia version is that types can also be dispatched and calculated differently, for example if we were to pass an integer through this function in Julia, we would get an error as we cannot iterate through an integer. The same would be true for Python. Where the two languages differ in this regard is that Julia would be able to have another entirely separate function that runs when the type of x is not an array:", "Although Python isn\u2019t a language that was necessarily created with scientific computing in mind, it does fit the role quite well. The language does this by implementing tools that make it easier to utilize scientific and mathematical syntax inside of the language. While Python\u2019s version of this might not be as great as the Julian implementation, it goes to show that Python is a powerful and versatile language that can stand aside most others in the world of scientific computing. Furthermore, lambda is a great tool to have at your disposal \u2014 scientist or not, and it is a great thing to have a firm hold on when programming in Python.", "Your home for data science.
