Numbers such as 1/2, 3/5, and 7/4 are called rationals. Like all other numbers, irrationals can be represented using decimals. However, in contrast with the other subsets of the real numbers (shown in Fig. 1), the decimal expansion of the irrationals never terminates, nor, like recurring decimals (such as 1/3 = 0.333\u2026), ends with a sequence that repeats itself (see this link). Among the set of irrational numbers is \u03c0, the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter (as shown in Fig. 2).", "The value of \u03c0 has been numerically estimated by several ancient civilizations (see this link). However, n the 17th century, after the discovery of the calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, infinite series started to be used to obtain better approximations. An example would be:", "which was first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama. For x=1 it becomes the so-called Leibniz formula for \u03c0:", "which has the downside of converging very slowly.", "Another famous example of an irrational number is the square root of 2 which was discovered by the followers of the legendary philosopher Pythagoras of Samos. It is said that initially, they concealed their discovery and, according to legend, murdered the philosopher Hippasus of Metapontum for eventually revealing it.", "Our goal here is to provide a simple proof of the irrationality of \u03c0. In order to do that, we will follow Niven and start by defining an auxiliary function f(x).", "Let us first consider the following (apparently unrelated) function:", "where n is an integer. This function can be written as a power expansion. For example, for n = 1, 2 and 3 we have:", "In general, one has the following equality:", "The coefficients can be easily determined. For n=1 for example,", "This is the first important property of f(x). This is obeyed since:", "We will need three other properties of f(x). Two of them are:", "where (m) is the m-th derivative.", "The last property we need is:", "which is an integer number. Note therefore that all derivatives of f(x) are integers. Also since f(x) remains the same if we interchange x and 1-x, the function itself and its derivatives are also integers at x=1.", "These properties can be made clearer with a simple example. Let n=4. Then we have:", "from where we can read the values of the c coefficients:", "We can see that all properties are obeyed (the cases m=6 and m=7 are omitted to avoid excessive cluttering):", "This proof is by the Canadian-American mathematician Ivan M. Niven. One starts by supposing the contrary of what we want to prove. More concretely we suppose that \u03c0\u00b2 is rational:", "We then build the following function:", "whose second derivative (which will be needed below) is:", "where Eq. 5 was used to eliminate derivatives of f(x) higher than 2n.", "As we just saw, f(x) and all its derivatives are integers at x=0 and x=1. This implies that F(0) and F(1), hence F(1) + F(0), are also integers. We now use the following identity:", "where Eq. 6 was used to eliminate b. Integrating both sides we get:", "which contradicts our previous finding that F(1) + F(0) is an integer. The initial hypothesis Eq. 6 is therefore false and \u03c0\u00b2 must be irrational. Now if \u03c0 were rational, \u03c0\u00b2 would also be. Hence \u03c0 must also be irrational, which concludes the proof.", "The elegance and simplicity of this proof are undeniable. They make us realize how beautiful pure mathematics can be.", "My Github and personal website www.marcotavora.me have some other interesting material both about mathematics and other topics such as physics, data science, and finance.
