However, this brings with it the danger that a practitioner becomes unaware of the design decisions and, hence, the limits of machine learning algorithms. [1]", "In this article, I want to discuss my experience in a formal degree program in analytics and draw comparisons with an autodidactic approach (here, defined to include books, projects, YouTube tutorials, MOOCs, and any other \u00e0 la carte learning that cannot be summed to form a degree).", "I want to say up front that, if you want to switch to a career as a data scientist from a very different discipline, like I did, then I do not think self-directed learning can compare to a formal education at a reputable institution. This opinion may not be popular, and I know that holding such an opinion is likely to result in tarring, feathering, and being deemed a \u201cheretic\u201d or \u201cgatekeeper\u201d by the High Court of Twitter.", "But please, set your pitchfork down for several minutes and hear me out.", "Since I was old enough to understand that a person who likes science and mathematics does not necessarily have to become a doctor or an accountant, my goal in life has been to \u201csolve problems.\u201d Vague, I know, but even today, I cannot come up with a more fitting or more descriptive raison d\u2019\u00eatre.", "So I did what any young girl who wants to solve problems would do: I enrolled at a local university as a chemical engineering major. After changing majors a small handful of times (I enjoyed my engineering classes but found the internships quite drab), I graduated from Drexel University in 2015 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in\u2026chemical engineering. That\u2019s right: I ended up back where I started.", "But I had a new plan: a few short weeks after being handed my degree, I packed everything I owned into my 2004 Acura TL and moved to Atlanta, GA, to study analytics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.", "There were three main reasons for my decision to enter the master\u2019s program at Georgia Tech upon completing my bachelor\u2019s degree: (1) I had absolutely no desire to work (and perhaps suffer bodily harm*) in a chemical plant; (2) I loved the potential of using data for decision-making; and (3) \u201cdata scientist\u201d had recently been named the \u201cSexiest Job of the 21st Century,\u201d and I wanted to be sexy.", "There are obviously many ways to learn about a topic, and I will admit that the time and money associated with a degree program may not be worthwhile for every person or every career. (If you have worked in data science-adjacent roles for years, perhaps a few self-driven projects are all you need to shift your career.) However, in the following subsections, I will discuss what I view as the primary benefits of a formal education.", "As I mention above, there are many ways to learn about a topic, and given the availability of free online resources, I think that anyone can teach themselves almost anything to which they set their mind (this availability of information is especially true for data science**). Further, if you truly understand how to apply data science concepts, then there is absolutely no reason (barring some blatant displays of sociopathy, etc.) why you should not be able to find gainful employment.", "However, it is very difficult to know if you don\u2019t fully understand a topic when you design your own curriculum, and further, when learning is entirely self-directed, there is a risk of focusing on material that is easy to understand rather than that which is important to understand.", "Suppose I hack together a machine learning pipeline, and it is truly a great pipeline, I promise: it runs quickly, the only parameter it requires can be simply derived from the response variable, and it obtains 100% accuracy on the training set.", "If there is no one to address my gaps in knowledge, then there is a chance that I will not find them until it is too late: when, for example, a client has lost huge sums of money by making decisions based on my flimsy insights, and I have been ousted as a data charlatan.", "In other words: Students need teachers.", "I consider myself a fairly accomplished autodidact: I read voraciously, and I am not afraid to start a project for little more reason than a fleeting interest; however, self-teaching, when you have a full-time job, a family, bills to pay, donuts to eat, etc., is often rife with starts and stops.", "I know this because I have experienced it: I have been studying German on and off for almost a decade, and while I have progressed during that time, I still find myself having to review the same vocabulary time and time again because I seldom make fluency in German a priority.", "For this reason, if you are serious about a career in data science, then it is imperative to focus on learning by immersing yourself in the topic. I think, if a person is committed to learning, then they can teach themselves in their spare time, sure, but such practices could impede learning.", "In other words: A full-time degree program is the easiest way to immerse yourself in a topic because, during your studies, learning is your main priority.", "I have an aunt who used to tell me, \u201cit\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know,\u201d and this sentiment used to bother me because, growing up, I was a loner who hoped she could get by on her brains alone, writing myself off as too shy and awkward to be charming. So I never really expected to like networking.", "But when I arrived at Georgia Tech, my classmates formed a fairly close little group: We worked on homework together in common areas, we rented an Airbnb together to attend a conference in another city, and we got beers together after finals, bonded by our shared suffering and proximity.", "I didn\u2019t realize growing up, in high school and such, when I thought I would have to get by on my own, that these experiences with my peers were networking. It is not all job fairs and elevator pitches: it\u2019s staying on campus late trying to debug code and learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes.", "And then there were job fairs and the on-campus interviews, too, and I got to give my elevator pitch to these huge and important companies because I was part of this great program. And it was a great feeling, to be part of something.", "In other words: Sometimes it is who you know, what you know, and what who you know knows.", "(Later on, in another story, I packed up the \u201904 Acura TL once again, drove all my belongings to Cleveland, OH, for little more reason than a fleeting interest, and found a job using my brains alone (and maybe a little charm).", "What can I say? One works with what one has at the time at which one has it.)", "When I set out to discuss my experience, I wanted to focus on the comparison of traditional on-campus programs to self-teaching via books, projects, and MOOCs. However, there are a handful of new online programs in analytics and computer science (e.g., Georgia Tech has them; UT Austin has them), and I believe these programs are starting to redefine a university education in a way in which MOOCs have yet to be able. The programs are less expensive than their on-campus counterparts, but they purportedly provide the same well-renowned education and the same degree. I have not personally taken any classes as part of one such program, but they seem like an amazing step toward equitable and accessible education for all.", "I imagine these programs will be somewhat limited in terms of networking opportunity (although, given the current situation, with all networking being done remotely, perhaps online students will be integrated into such events), but they do provide a curated academic experience, and given their reduced price, students may be better equipped to devote their full attention to learning.", "Although statisticians and computer scientists have been performing the tasks that now fall under the umbrella of \u201cdata science\u201d for several millennia, data science is an emerging field, and as such, it is often treated as a trade that can be learned by focusing on practical application and deemphasizing theory.", "This perspective, of data science as a trade, is exemplified by every article that describes how to become a data scientist in a fortnight or less and in every three-minute video in which a person draws a line between squares and circles and calls it machine learning. Such oversimplifications are detrimental to the field as a whole: If we do not take ourselves and our education seriously, why should others?", "Much of data science is applied, yes, and programming skills are incredibly important in industry, but to truly become an expert who can be trusted to derive useful insights from data and to teach machines to learn and love, it is not possible to separate application from mathematical and computational theory.", "Law and engineering each went through a similar process, beginning as trades before being formalized as professions, with organizations, codes of ethics, licenses, and barriers to entry, such as university tuition*** (though perhaps such barriers can be avoided, as mentioned above, while maintaining the more positive aspects of formalization).", "I believe, over time, due to their potential role in decision-making, data scientists will be held to increasingly high professional standards, and at many companies, they already are, as many data science roles require applicants to hold a PhD.", "Do I think every data scientist needs a PhD? No, and (although I would love to return to my studies) I do not have one myself. But I do believe that the requirement of a PhD for certain data science roles shows that industry leaders place a certain importance on two skills in particular: (1) the ability to design and perform research studies and (2) the ability question one\u2019s own assumptions and biases.", "Therefore, if you are reading this article because you are interested in becoming a data scientist, I highly suggest that you consider a program that not only teaches you applied skills but also teaches you how to approach research problems in a thorough and considered way.", "I would not give up my experience at Georgia Tech for anything. There has not been a time when I questioned if my time or money could have been better spent, and not because of some kind of cognitive voodoo like the sunk-cost fallacy, but because the classes I took and the people I met had an indelible and invaluable effect on my approach to problem solving and collaboration.", "I will be the first person to tell you that I am no expert when it comes to data science. I learn something new with each project I do, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way: I want to solve problems, not create them, and I believe my education has helped me to understand the difference.", "*I worked at DuPont\u2019s Chambers Works site for an internship; people have actually gotten cancer and died from working there, not to mention the explosion that killed four at another site, which occurred soon after my internship.", "**I think the joke is, \u201cdata science is 90% data cleaning, 10% data analysis, modelling, etc.,\u201d but it should be, \u201cdata science is 10% doing data science, 90% talking about doing data science.\u201d", "*** In the United States, anyway.", "[1] Deisenroth, Marc Peter, et al.
