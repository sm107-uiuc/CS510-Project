You may have \u201cgood\u201d data and understand how to build a model, but if you are able to interpret the efficiency of your model you\u2019ll be able to interpret your results and provide the ultimate business decisions!", "With regression, we predict continuous variables so it makes sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates are. With classification problems, we are dealing with binary variables so our model is either right or wrong. As a result, we examine a few specific measurements when evaluating performance of a classification algorithm.", "Example: Predict if an employee is Employed or Not Employed (Active). In this project we ideally what to predict if a candidate is a good fit for the company.", "Precision: \u201cOut of all the times the model said someone was employed, how many times did the employee in question actually have a job at \u201cDental Magic?\u201d", "Recall: \u201cOut of all the employees we saw that actually were employed, what percentage of them did our model correctly identify as having active employment?\u201d", "Precision and recall have an inverse relationship. As one goes up the other will go down.", "This is a classic data science question. What is better more false positives or false negatives? The answer is \u201cIT DEPENDS ON THE PROBLEM\u201d and can test your critical thinking abilities. So let\u2019s examine a new example.", "Detecting credit card fraud, a false positive would be when our model flags a transaction as fraudulent and it isn\u2019t. This results in a slightly annoyed customer. A false negative might be a fraudulent transaction that a company mistakenly lets through as normal consumer behavior. In this case, the credit card company could be on the hook for reimbursing the customer for thousands of dollars because they missed the signs that the transaction was fraudulent! Although being wrong is never ideal, it makes sense that credit card companies tend to build their models to be a bit too sensitive, because having a high recall saves them more money than having a high precision score.", "Let\u2019s analyze our HR example. Our model wants to predict whether a person will fit within the company \u201cemployed vs non-employed\u201d. In this situation we ideally want both to be low: false negatives and false positives. As an HR employee we\u2019d like our false positives to be higher than false negatives and here\u2019s why. With a higher false positive our model predicts our candidate is a good fit when they are actually not\u2026 This is just the first round of interviewing scans of candidates, we would rather look through more resumes than miss out on one potentially good candidate for the role. The ultimate hiring decision comes down a persons final decision.", "When evaluating models we want to visualize an ROC Curve. Illustrating the true positive rate against the false positive rate of our classifier. True positive rate is another name for recall which is a ratio of the true positive predictions compared to all values that are actually positive.", "False positive rates is the ratio of false positive predictions compared to all values that are actually negative.", "If TPR is our y-axis and FPR is our x-axis, we want our ROC curve to hug the left side of our chart meaning higher the TPR the lower the FPR.", "The logistic regression model produces probabilities that each observation\u2019s specific class. Imagine it looking like the image below:", "If we alter cutoff point it will sacrifice precision, increasing the FPR in order to increase the TPR or vice versa. Shifting the decision boundary to the left from 0.5 will result in capturing more of the positive class (1) cases. It will also pick up some false positives (red cases at the far right of the negative (0) case distribution).", "Models with poor ROC might have large overlaps in the probability estimates for the two classes. This will indicate that our model had difficulty separating the two classes from each other.", "Using Matplotlib we want to visualize our ROC Curve:", "As shown to the left you can see that our classification models TPR vs FPR. Think about the scenario of this model: predicting employees fit within the company. If you tune the current model to have an 76% True Positive Rate, (you\u2019ve still missed 29% of those who would be a good fit), what is the False positive rate?", "When TPR = 75% then the FPR is 22%. The true positive rate determines the percentage of employees that are active who are who are correctly identified as a good fit. At the same time, this has a FPR of nearly .25 meaning that roughly one in four times we incorrectly warn an employee of being a good fit when they are actually not performing well.", "The overall accuracy of a classifier can be quantified by the AUC, the Area Under the Curve. Perfect classifiers would have an AUC score of 1.0 while an AUC of 0.5 is worthless. Here we have and AUC of .80 which seems to be accurate.", "Your home for data science.
