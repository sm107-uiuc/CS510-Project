I\u2019m always amazed by how simple they make it sound when in reality we all know it\u2019s very difficult hence we are lead to believe there\u2019s something external that we need to gain before we can improve \u2014 for instance, better math skills, better coding skills, etc.", "I\u2019ve come to realize that though those skills can be extremely important \u2014 some roles put more emphasis on certain skills than others \u2014 the most important thing that must change to develop into a great Data Scientist is a mindset shift that slightly changes the purpose behind why certain actions.", "The readers of my articles would know that it is my goal to develop into a top Data Scientist, and in the process, bring as many of you that have been faithfully following me along in this journey so here are 3 traits I\u2019ve noticed in some of the great Data Scientist.", "The greatest Data Scientists are extremely productive and I\u2019ve always wondered how they became so productive, but now it is making sense. They are Learnaholics!", "As we repeat tasks, we become accustomed to how to do that thing. Don\u2019t believe me? Ask anyone that has been doing Data Science for 1 year to spin up a Jupyter Notebook and fit a Logistic Regression model to the Iris Dataset.", "Alternatively, ask them to fit a 2 layer neural network to some other dataset and the number of successes we\u2019d get may not be as high.", "The point I want to make is that the greatest Data Scientist put themselves in situations where they are forced to learn and practice new things repetitively. Whether that means participating in Data Science competitions, hackathons, or doing lots of personal projects.", "One Data Scientist that is a good friend of mine, Harpreet Sahota, once said to me that he reads a lot of research papers but it is only because it helps him generate more ideas. I\u2019ve also listened to some of the best Kaggle grandmasters mention how important it is to review previous winning solutions and code them up from scratch.", "\u201cSo everyone has and uses mental representations. What sets expert performers apart from everyone else is the quality and quantity of their mental representations.\u201d \u2014 Anders Ericsson", "A course of action to incorporate this trait could be to select something you\u2019d like to become better at, for example, you may want to improve your Data Science problem-solving skills because you feel you run out of ideas very quickly, therefore you may decide you are going to read as many competition-winning solutions as possible and begin them from scratch without any assistance other than google (and maybe messaging them to clarify some things that aren\u2019t clear).", "Data Science is tough for everybody. I\u2019ve spoken to some very smart individuals in the field and I am as amazed as you to realize that they also struggle at some tasks. The fact is that when a problem statement has been framed, nobody knows the solution immediately, hence we have to search for various ideas and possible solutions, and often it's to no prevail.", "What differentiates the greatest Data Scientists from the averages Jo\u2019s is that the top Data Scientists approach every single task with it stuck at the back of their mind that no matter how many times I get this wrong, I will continue trying until I find a solution. Whereas, someone else may give up and decide to put the project on hold or procrastinate about it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m so smart, it\u2019s just that I stay with problems longer..\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein", "These people believe that no matter how many times they are wrong, the time they are right will be extremely impactful so they continue to press on through their woes. If that means attempting 200 different solutions then they will do it until they arrive at an optimal solution.", "For us aiming to reach heights in Data Science, comment a response to this article stating something that you want to do in regards to Data Science for the coming year. For example, you may say you wish to develop a voice in the field as a Data Storyteller. After you\u2019ve done that think of something you can do today that will take you closer to that goal and repeat this step until you realize people are drooling at your visualizations.", "I wish to progress in Data Science was a linear combination of various factors. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and sometimes you have to do slightly more than the given steps to progress \u2014 I\u2019m sure many of you would have experienced this when you thought all you had to do to become a Data Scientist was to develop your math skills, Learn Python or R, do a project then apply for jobs.", "The top Data Scientists are aware that the journey to where they currently are is not linear. In fact, to prove this I may one day gather all of the transcripts from top data scientist that feel like their path to where they currently are was not conventional \u2014 it\u2019s actually quite funny how much no Data Scientist thinks they took a conventional path.", "\u201cI\u2019m convinced you can do almost anything if you are willing to clarify your goals and then make the incremental investment over time to achieve them,\u201d \u2014 Michael Hyatt", "The reason many of us give up on certain targets we\u2019ve set for ourselves in Data Science is that we set a massive goal and attempt to make progress or complete the goal in a few difficult steps \u2014 it doesn't work like that.", "There is no rushing of this process.", "Let\u2019s be honest, how many times have we given up on a Kaggle competition (or any other related Data Science task) because we didn\u2019t see large progress on our leaderboard score? Exactly!", "Instead, focus on daily incremental improvements that accumulate like compound interest rather than the giant leap.", "These are 3 traits that I\u2019ve noticed all of the top Data Scientists are equipped with so it is only my opinion. Do you think I\u2019ve missed something?", "If you liked this post you\u2019d also like:", "Let\u2019s continue the conversation on LinkedIn:", "If you\u2019re interested in blogging in the future, or you wish to take your blogging to the next level, follow me on Youtube where I share some of my greatest lessons:", "Your home for data science.
