To summarize everything, I\u2019ve proposed three pillars that a Data Scientist should look to improve in order to reach seniority:", "In this story, we will talk about the third pillar: interpersonal soft skills.", "In Greek mythology, Cassandra was a priestess that was cursed with prophecies that always became reality but never were believed by anyone. Have you ever had a project proposal denied? Did you ever have a pet project become a broken heart? It will happen, eventually. And maybe it's not the project that is flawed\u2026 Maybe it's your pitch.", "The ability to sell your points-of-view is essential to a Data Scientist. This is true for every structural developer but is especially relevant to Data-related jobs because of the inherent complexity of statistical analysis. Dealing with layman groups in marketing, the management or other developers requires didactic to get your message across. A Senior Data Scientist is first and foremost a great teacher.", "This skillset is useful in both sides of the career T-split between specialist and manager: as a specialist, you deal with ever-increasing complexity and must be able to convey your knowledge to your development teammates and higher-ups; as a manager, you must be able to share your knowledge about the inner workings of your Data to Product Owners and educate stakeholders on the possibilities and limits of your work.", "Presenting your Data projects is often referred to as data storytelling and there are many stories here in Medium explaining this concept in detail. Here are some of my personal picks:", "Enhancing this skill requires first and foremost experience. Practice explaining your projects in the mirror, to people around you that are not familiar with the concepts you're addressing, look around your area for meetups and schedule talks to train your public voice.", "You can also flex your academic muscles and practice writing papers. Synthesizing ideas into words with proper structure and peer reviews can increase your didactic prowess. Writing Medium articles is a great way to expose your ideas and collect feedback from like-minded fellows.", "Don't let your projects become Cassandra's prophecies: useful information forgotten on a shelf does nothing for you or your company.", "First, go ahead and read this story right here. It's a really good introduction to the Data Science Manager role.", "Project Managers are the ones involved in the inception and oversight of projects, monitoring both day-to-day progress, and stakeholder expectation management. They strive to maximize quality and minimize costs and time spent on development.", "To correctly assess a Data project, you need at least some knowledge in the field. You cannot set a 7-day deadline for a model that takes at least that much time for training, dump a labeling job in a single scientist and expect it to be easy, or promise the accuracy of a model trained on an unexplored dataset.", "Being the Senior Data Guy, your first job is to complement your Project Manager if he so needs it. Be the Jiminy Cricket, the Consiglieri, the Morpheus. Work together with him to safeguard your team from misleading projects. With his systematic views of the company and your technical advice, this transition period will be a learning experience for both.", "While doing that, keep training your individual Project Organization skills. With seniority comes responsibility and bigger solo projects. Start compartmentalizing to measure effort and time consumption. Take notes on the time needed to do difficult tasks, easy quick-wins, common roadblocks, and their solutions.", "After you dipped your feet in the managerial waters, start thinking about your next steps in the specialist/manager career path. Don't be pressured into choosing either by external forces: this is effectively a career change.", "Here are other resources about the role of a Data Science Manager:", "A Senior Developer usually takes charge of project development by mentoring and overseeing other developers. To fully realize his strength in a team, he needs to know the skills of each teammate in order to correctly distribute tasks and keep everyone at their maximum productivity.", "This is not different in the area of Data Science. Alongside front/back engineers, you need to keep track of specific Data skills: what modality (multimedia, textual data, numeric data) each teammate knows, if they are better developing proofs of concept, doing pipeline engineering, dashboarding\u2026 Just like in a heist movie, the success of a project is entirely dependant on the composition of the crew.", "You are not (yet) a unicorn. You may have some broad knowledge in all the development steps, but you are not a specialist in every single one of them. It's part of the learning process to separate what you can and what you cannot do, and who can complement your skills.", "To improve this skill, you need to listen. Listen to the feedbacks of your colleagues. Listen to the complaints on a day-to-day basis. Listen to the praises about the workplace in general. Pay attention to pet projects of your teammates: these are the areas they actively pursue outside their usual work.", "There are two books that will improve your views about your workplace relationships and your general communication skills: Emotional Intelligence, and Social Intelligence, by Daniel Goleman. If you are thirsty for a cup of knowledge and not a whole river, I could suggest these well-thought articles about them:", "I\u2019m partial to the thought that a Data Scientist is a good learner and not necessarily a know-er. Don\u2019t be desperate to delve into every area and be a master in it. Slowly but surely we will accumulate knowledge and experience dealing with Data on a daily basis. We are all walking up in the steps of Data together!", "Thank you for reading, and have fun in this Data-filled universe!", "Your home for data science.
