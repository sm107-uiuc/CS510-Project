Especially with the rise of Twitter, Facebook, and Google to process unstructured data in search engines or personal AI assistants. More and more application of NLP has gained immense popularity.", "Consider Google Search of cat images. What cats do you mean?", "There are so many cats. You have mutant cats in \u201ccats\u201d theatric shows. You have cartoon cats. Which one are you talking about?", "The adjacent word such as \u201cCute\u201d and \u201cShow\u201d further explains what I want. This is the context to evaluate NLP performance.", "Consider Google Home Mini which you can just buy using $50. Does it understand query context?", "Imagine your little daughter asks Google Home Mini on her assignment project \u201cOk Google, Define twinkle-twinkle little star\u201d.", "Should not Google Home smart enough to know that it is the title of a song?", "Imagine you wanted to predict Donald Trump\u2019s triumph over Hillary Clinton during the last presidential elections.", "Could you predict it from the general sentiments on Twitter? How and what were the points of satisfaction of each presidential candidate?", "Imagine your Master/Bachelor Class Forums: It is very hard to extract what\u2019s important from all of those informations.", "Could you build a model that potentially extract all of the key topics and filter the posts based on that?", "NLP is getting more and more ubiquitous and important to study. The potential is huge and is used in every part of the world now.", "NLP\u2019s biggest enemy is ambiguity, and NLP\u2019s biggest friend is context \u2014 Vincent Tatan", "\u201cWhy r u so gloomy? Have fun lah!", "For us, it seems that the meaning of the words are very clear. \u201cr u\u201d represents \u201care you\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d is a common American informal greeting.", "However, there are ambiguities in these sentences. \u201cWhat\u2019s up\u201d literal answer should be \u201cThe sun is up\u201d not \u201cI am good, thank you\u201d. There are hidden contexts that make it hard for us to explain the computer what these sentences exactly mean.", "Most of the time, we assume the listener will fill in lots of gaps based on our knowledge of the world and shared context.", "What do we already know about each other?", "Interestingly, we don\u2019t know how meaning arises from words in our brains. But it all feels very easy to us.", "This is why that we need Machine Learning and NLP techniques for the computer to identify these rules and contexts from corpuses of text.", "In this lesson we are going to use this Colab to follow through the tutorial. Feel free to open this and run directly. This colab shows a simple application of NLP.", "Imagine you ask your daughters about what they love to eat. One of the kids answered \u201cI love ice cream!\u201d Can you guess whether they are smiling excitedly or frowning?", "Can you do that if I just showed you the word \u201cI <insert word here> Ice cream\u201d? How do you know if this kid is frowning or not?", "To answer this sentimental analysis question, let us break down NLP to these basic principles:", "Tokenization decomposes texts into tokens and indexes which are understandable by computers.", "We will talk about how to understand words by tokenizing them. Consider the word FRIED. We can represent these alphabets with ASCII numbers. But FIRED also has the same letters but different word due to the orders.", "Ok, then let\u2019s use the words instead. In the text \u201cI love my dog\u201d we can encode it per word \u2192 1[I], 2[love], 3[my], 4[dog]. We will take a look at the code to achieve the tokenization", "The Tokenizer API already removed all of the exclamation mark and punctuations around which are handy to get your word tokens quickly.", "First we need to tokenize our APIs from Keras. Then we can create the sentences. Num_words parameter here meaning the number of words to keep. In this case, we will keep 100 most frequent words that appear in the corpuses.", "How about if the tokenizer finds words that do not exist in the word_index? Then we need to specify Out of Vocabulary (OOV) tokens and which identifies the word as index 1.", "Congrats! You just indexed these tokens for training!", "Sequencing represents sentences from sequence of words and their respective indexes. We use tokenizer.texts_to_sequence to translate the corpuses into tokens in sequences.", "Sequencing is important because the order of the words matter. \u201cI love fish\u201d and \u201cfish love I \u201c has different semantic meaning and grammatical error. The order of the sentence determines which token gets to be the object or subject of the meaning.", "This sequences the tokens and padded the remaining token spaces to match the dimension of the longest sequences. These are important to run mathematical operations during embedding/sentimental analysis.", "Note that there are several indexes we can extract from here:", "Padding allows us to standardize the length of each corpus. This makes it easier to run multiple operations with numpy and prepare it for Neural Network (NN) training.", "Embedding projects an input into multi dimensional representation space. For example we can project the following words into polarity sub space.", "Let\u2019s plot each word in multi dimension spaces. Then when we want to have the combined meanings. We can combine these vectors together and generate the unified vectors.", "For example good is considered positive sentiment and bad is considered negative sentiment. But if you use good \u2026 and bad \u2026 in the same sentence (e.g: I think your essay is good, but your handwriting is bad), then the sentiment is neutral.", "By experimenting with Tensorflow and Keras, we could train a Neural Network with embedding as our inputs. With this colab notebook, you could experiment doing Kaggle problem and run the codes.", "There are more applications of such to NLP. And I hope that this simple tutorial can whet your appetite to explore on how you can process words and languages.", "Grammar and Vocabularies are complex. We need more techniques to derive our features and tokenize better.", "In conclusion, I believe these basic NLPs are simple to implement straight away in your first exploration. We have learnt that:", "Feel free to take a look at how you implement it in DNN framework such as Tensorflow and Keras.", "As always, please reach out to me on Linkedin for any of your questions.
