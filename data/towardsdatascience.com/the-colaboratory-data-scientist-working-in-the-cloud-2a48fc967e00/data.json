It\u2019s not just the ease of setting up and using a powerful environment, but it is also the ability to share and have someone take over later on.", "If you are new to the Colab bandwagon, I think of it as a Jupyter Notebook that lives and works in the cloud. If you are new to all that, you are a couple of years late, but hey, you\u2019ll get caught up soon.", "I started using Colab (or notebooks in general) to explore a new dataset or a library. These days, I find myself doing most of the data science within a notebook, that includes data visualization with libraries like seaborn or bokeh, all of the machine learning and even performance monitoring.", "The strongest points (of a Colab workflow) for me have been:", "This all seems too good to be true, but that is the kinda world we live in!", "A few months earlier, whenever I got my hands on a juicy new dataset and had noted down my hypotheses, this is what I did:", "Followed by a a couple dozen of these:", "In theory, I could use my existing conda environments, but from experience I almost always know I\u2019m going to use some new library which will not sit well with some existing library.", "So if I update the library, my main project that will one day bring me fame and money will break sadly which will lead to 5 more hours of scrounging stackoverflow.", "Then I add some GPU by going to Runtime > Change Runtime, like so.

Usually when I have an idea of a plot in mind, I don\u2019t know how to actually plot it, so I stackoverflow it, which is generally quicker than looking through the documentations.", "Now, in Colab, I can directly search for working code snippets and alter them as I want.
