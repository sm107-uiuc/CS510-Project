Despite investing in tech companies, the daily activities in a VC fund use to be too manual and based on feelings and impressions instead of data.", "Of course, most part of the time, the data is not available and the decisions must be guided by subjective aspects. In this case, the experience and the fund\u2019s network matter a lot. Sometimes, the data is available and VCs can use it to guide their decisions.", "In this article, I will show how to visualize the connections among the venture capital funds based on their co-investments. To do so, we will resort to the network charts.", "Our network chart will be useful to a VC fund that wants to understand their competitor\u2019s interactions, to a Fund of Funds that intends to create a diversified portfolio and even to a startup that is planning its roadshow. The network chart is also a good tool to precede a detailed cluster analysis.", "Here we will focus on the algorithm and the interpretation will be detailed on a second article. We will use Python and the library Networkx, which is very flexible and fits our needs. In our undirected network chart, each node represents a VC Fund and the edge thickness indicates the number of co-investments between two funds.", "You may be wondering why the number of co-investments jumps from 7 to 16 (max value). That\u2019s a special case of two government-backed funds.", "The figure below shows a portion of our network chart. We can see that a few funds have many co-investments and that there are three major groups based on the co-investment criteria.", "Before going ahead, let\u2019s understand the source of our data!", "The data came only from Crunchbase. In real-life, we collect data from different sources, such as VCs funds website, press and public documents. That\u2019s important because a relevant percentage of the investments are not on the Crunchbase\u2019s platform.", "In this article, I focused only on Brazillian funds and startups, but it can be easily replicated to any other country. l also didn\u2019t consider the number of investments or portfolio companies per fund, but it could be well represented in the node size.", "Now I will show how to organize the data according to the output from Crunchbase.", "First of all, let\u2019s import all the libraries.", "We need to read two datasets. The df_investors includes the name of all institutional venture capital funds headquartered in Brazil with at least one investment. The df_startups includes the name of Brazilian startups with a total funding amount higher than USD 300k, as well as the name of their investors.", "Let\u2019s check how the datasets look like.", "The column \u201cInvestors\u201d in the df_startups dataset includes all the investors. We will filter to get only the Brazilian investors.", "There are more efficient ways to get the outcome above, but merging the datasets is very simple to implement when we have different sources of data.", "Now we will exclude the startups with only one investor because they are not relevant to our analysis.", "Now we have 207 records that represent the number of investments that resulted in at least one co-investment. The real number larger than this, but due to the source of our data and the criteria adopted, that\u2019s our number.", "Before going ahead, let\u2019s create a list of all the possible combinations of investors. It will be useful soon.", "Now, we will create a dictionary in which each key will represent a venture capital fund and the values will be the startups backed by this fund.", "Now, we will create a new data frame, which will be responsible to store the count of the co-investments among the venture capital funds. The \u201cCo-investments\u201d column is the 2-length combination of investors and the \u201c# Co-investments\u201d shows the number of co-investments for each combination. It\u2019s common to have more than two investors per startup, we are considering it.", "Thanks to Daniel Gribel, who helped me to correct and improve this step!", "The data frame above will work as input for the network chart.", "The Networkx uses Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted network. Let\u2019s start by creating an undirected Graph.", "Now we will read the data frame df_network_1 to add the weighted edges in the graph. We also will style our chart, adding different colors and thicknesses to the edges according to the number of co-investments.", "The figure above is our final result! I hid the names for better visualization, but they are useful in a detailed analysis. We can notice that some funds have a strong connection, meaning they have many co-investments.", "I highlighted some groups in the chart. Group 1 includes some of the first Brazillian Venture Capital Funds who raised capital from the government to foster the ecosystem. Group 2 includes the most active funds, those with a major number of investments, exits, and unicorns. Group 3 includes private VCs and government-backed VCs, being connected by investment in agribusiness startups.", "The figure below is output from Flourish, a platform that allows us to turn spreadsheets into interactive online charts without coding.", "The chart above is a proxy of how the Brazillian Venture Capital funds are connected, to obtain a conclusive outcome we need to search for alternatives sources of data besides Crunchbase (funds\u2019 website is a good fount!). Networks charts across time is also a good way to visualize how new funds are getting into the market.", "The network chart for monitoring co-investments is only one example of how a VC can use data in its daily activities. Since I started working on a data-driven VC fund I have come across several ways to use public and proprietary data to enrich investment decisions.", "If you find any mistakes, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me! I started to surf the data science world recently and in spite of loving it, I am an amateur.", "Your home for data science.
