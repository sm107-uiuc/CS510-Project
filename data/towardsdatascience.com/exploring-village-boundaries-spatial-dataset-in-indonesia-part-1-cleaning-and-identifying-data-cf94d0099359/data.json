Geographical situation \u2014 mountainous area, river, and archipelago \u2014 were the typical difficulties which makes the effort resource-exhausting, in addition to complicated negotiation to local stakeholders settling on boundaries line. Thus, right now we may still finds noticeable generalization \u2014 straight lines and coarse delineation \u2014 in some parts of Indonesia, especially in the eastern region. But, at least the government is trying to improve them year by year to give the most accurate information regarding administrative boundary information, which is crucial to the land registration and administration. There may still needs more improvement as the Geospatial Information Agency (BIG) trying to secure the deal including the basemap project of all Indonesia in the size of 1:5.000 to potential investor such as World Bank and Ordnance Survey. Thus, we still needs to wait for decent administrative boundary.", "Furthermore, on the 2019 term, BIG released the authorities responsible to thematic maps with letter SK Kepala BIG no. 27/2019 including the mapping of level-4 administrative boundary goes to Direktorat Penataan Administasi dan Pemerintahan Desa, while in Level 2 and 3 is Direktorat Toponimi dan Batas Daerah jurisdiction. Still in the same ministry but different directorate. This may solving the former problems when there were still no clear jurisdiction of whether who was responsible to the data, which sometimes BPS and BIG tends to overlapping regarding this data. Although, still there some dualism between which data should be relying on when it comes to the matter, even other ministries also have the same headache. To better understanding to this problem, i addressed to scoping this problem into much more detailed view so we gain much more understanding beneath to our village boundary data by doing some exploratory data analysis based on dataset from either Ministry of Internal Affairs (Kemendagri) and Statistics Indonesia (BPS).", "The village boundaries data used were obtained from respective REST Services both for BPS and Kemendagri. Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Geopandas in Google Colaboratory here, I am trying to exploring the data underneath. In this part one, cleaning and identifying procedure were done to give some general insight and doing some cross-check of this twos.", "Cleaning data procedure initialized to clean some of the untidy data, which some of them looks irritating. First of all, open the data from the Drive to be loading into Google Colabs, the geospatial format was the original from the providers (in geojson format)", "Opening for spatial data from Kemendagri which hard to interpreting at the first time because the annoying column name. To better understand each and every column, you can see the real name here. Using tail() instead of head() is meant to distinguish from null values in the first 10 rows of this data. Later on, I managed to simplify the data and improve readability.", "Opening for spatial dataset from BPS, not much to clean, just to simplify the necessary data will be great consideration. Although, the data still needs to be improved because I found that some of the data include the geographical features (lakes, forest, and field) which literally not a village name category so later on I am trying to remove some of them.", "Next thing, I want to know how many data is being used in these two. Maybe useful to notice the noticeable difference between the two just by crunching the numbers", "This is the case for Kemendagri\u2019s data, to improve simplicity and readability by using .iloc from column 17 to 225, I could distinguish some of the features that not really necessary at this part then rename it by using the guide from the original source. The column that I intend to keep were the code number for different level administrative and the administrative names.", "In case of BPS, just same with the previous data, it was somehow rather manageable..", "Now the final act on cleaning data, the Kemendagri\u2019s data still have a null values including lakes feature (called Danau), so I have tried to eliminate those features by based on the column ID_PROP but really don\u2019t have a clue whether I have made the right choice by simply remove them.", "Moving on to more difficult ones, although the BPS\u2019 data did not have any null values, but there are some features which not classified as a village prior to geographical features such as lakes, forest, and fields.", "So, how can we distinguish those feature? I realize that the ID_DESA column is consisting of the unique code. For instance the ID_DESA = 1107050001 meaning that 11 is province code, 07 is regency/city code, 050 is district code, and at last the 001 is village code. So, i decided to split the values into new column called ID_NEW which only show the village code.", "Then, I try to show the unique values based on that column", "Because I really curious what these data meant, so I decided to take it one step further\u2026", "Finally, the last thing were to drop the values above 200 because I found it really convenient to just eliminate that way instead of using some conditional.", "Now, the data were considerably clean than before but with some drawbacks in size prior to removing some of the features. To show the difference between the original and the cleaned version, here are quick look about the total size of the respective data.", "The calculation result is 0 and 2,4 ha for the Kemendagri and BPS data respectively. The zero value merely because I delete the feature which did not have any size values at first place. The BPS difference with 2,4 ha is acceptable because of the deletion of some huge features such as large lakes and huge forest. Furthermore, the difference between the two is 1,4 ha after the alteration", "As you can see, the original data from BPS matches with the official regulation from Ministry of Internal Affairs (see: Permendagri number 137/2017) which states the total size of Indonesia is 1,91 million sq kilometers. The BPS data was released on 2016 meanwhile the Kemendagri data was released on 2017 yet the latter show considerable deficit by 3,8 ha. How come?", "Are we really, Indonesia, shrinking in size? How come that data that comes a year later have a size that lesser than the previous one? Although the number of feature in Kemendagri data were greater (83.322 rows) compared to BPS (79.191 rows). I do not see any clearer explanation between these two, yet to even pick any of the trusted data.", "Anyhow, Kemendagri really needs to fixed this as one of their responsibility\u2026soon.", "Part 2 will be performing analyzing and visualizing the data that previously cleaned here. No more boring editing, may be some of the mesmerizing chart and interesting information will be shown.", "Your home for data science.
