APIs basically let you interact with some tool or service (which could be provided by literally anybody).", "You can use APIs to do retrieve some kind of information from a data source and then use it in your own script or application. Public (open) APIs are great because they allow any third-party developer to build something that can connect to an existing service.", "There are popular APIs to do \u201cserious stuff\u201d like track time-series stock data or provide updates on air quality. We won\u2019t be touching those in this piece, as I wanted to share some fun APIs you can experiment on while you\u2019re learning to interact with an API or even create one.", "You could even build a simple personal project with one of these, to learn how to connect an application to an API from whichever language you\u2019re currently learning.", "I thought I\u2019d kick things off with an adorable baby goat.", "This is a really simple GET API where you can generate pictures of goats. I wish I had more to say but that\u2019s really it. Here are links to the main site and the Github repository.", "You can specify the width and the height in pixels of the image you want to generate like this:", "If you\u2019re just looking to test out the requests library in Python, this would be a great place to start. If you need an idea, try writing a script to get a daily goat image and send it to your significant other (or your mom) every morning to remind them of how much you care about them. It\u2019ll be a better version of breakfast in bed.", "The RESTful Pok\u00e9Api is free to use and allows you to GET information from a comprehensive database on everything from the Pok\u00e9mon games, from the first Red and Blue releases until Sword and Shield.", "The database is really extensive. You can get anything from a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s abilities to evolution triggers to berry firmness. Check out the Pok\u00e9Api main site and the documentation directly for more information. If you\u2019re interested in a language-specific wrapper, check the Wrapper Libraries section. For example, you could install the Pokebase Python interface for use directly in your Python scripts, instead of having to call the API with the requests library.", "I didn\u2019t know berries could be categorized by firmness. I wanted to find out more, so I followed this link:", "Normally, when you call an API endpoint, you should also supply an ID or name to retrieve the information for a specific data point. With the Pok\u00e9Api, they say that if you call an endpoint without an ID or name, you\u2019ll get a default list of up to 20 resources available for the API. In this case, there are 5 possible results for the \u201cberry firmness\u201d endpoint, so you see all of them returned in JSON format when you call the link above.", "It\u2019s a good time to note that when you\u2019re using fully open APIs, you should be mindful of how often you\u2019re calling a service\u2019s endpoints. The Pok\u00e9Api removed its rate limiting (API configuration of how many requests can be made per time interval), but it still reminds users to limit how frequent their requests are to keep the hosting costs low. In their fair use policy, they say that people should locally cache requested resources and that DDoS attacks will result in a permanent IP address ban. Be responsible!", "This API is RESTful and allows you to use GraphQL to query it. They also conveniently link you to the GraphQL docs if you\u2019re new to the query language. You can use the API by making GET requests for metadata on characters, locations, and episodes from the show.", "To get information about a character from the show, you should supply their ID to the character endpoint like this:", "Here, supplying \u201c5\u201d gives us the character information on Jerry Smith. You also see at the end an associated image of the character, so if you\u2019re looking to practice downloading files from an API, this might be a good place to start.", "Check out the main site and the documentation for more information. There are also a bunch of wrapper libraries by several authors for different languages, so check those out if you\u2018d rather use those. The Python implementation for it can be found here. Also, if you know some JavaScript and are interested in contributing to an open-source project, you can check out The Rick and Morty API Github.", "I\u2019m not sure if my API-related puns so far count, but I definitely love all sorts of \u201cbad\u201d jokes.", "You can use the icanhazdadjoke API to fetch a dad joke from the service. The API documentation gives examples of how you can interact with the API\u2019s endpoints with curl.", "curl is a neat tool you can use from your terminal to transfer data to or from a server. In this case, you could test it out by using HTTP to GET a specific URL. For example, you could try the following in your terminal:", "The -H command-line argument allows you to include one parameter, which in this case is \u201cAccept: text/plain\u201d, of an extra header in the request. This modification allows you to specify the type of output from your request, which here will just be plaintext. You could also set it to JSON (Accept: text/html) or HTML (Accept: Application/json) if that\u2019s what you need.", "There\u2019s also an endpoint you can use to search for specific jokes that match a certain keyword.", "It could be interesting to practice searching for a few keywords by calling this endpoint and storing the results in a database. Then you\u2019d have a local copy of jokes based on the keywords you specified.", "Check out the main site and the documentation for more information. There\u2019s also a GraphQL query endpoint you can use to query the API if you want to load data that way.", "The premise is really simple: you call the API and get an insult.", "Just like the goat API, I don\u2019t really have that much to say here.", "You can specify the language and the format of how you want the insult to be returned. For fun, I wanted to see if another language would actually work, so I tried to get a Spanish insult:", "\u201cMala leche\u201d translates literally to English as \u201cbad milk\u201d. Colloquially, you use it to describe someone that acts in bad faith or someone who\u2019s in a bad mood.", "You can also use this API as a really simple one to practice making requests with. Check out the main site and its (rather simple) documentation if you want to explore.", "I hope you try working with one of these as you start familiarizing yourself with APIs or if you\u2019re just looking for something fun to work with. Be sure to call the APIs responsibly, as these are public and meant to be consumed by everyone without charge. Pinging them too frequently can lead to your IP address being banned, which if you love goat pictures (or whatever service yo\u2019re using) will not be a good thing.", "Besides just calling GET requests, I mentioned that storing results might make for an interesting addition to your project, so check out this piece if you want to see how you can write to SQLite:", "For a completely different way of collecting data online, check out this piece on an introduction to the XPath language and its usage with Python:", "Your home for data science.
