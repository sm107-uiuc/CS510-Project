You noticed that the questions were heavily focused on clustering in the interview process, and now you get why: the CEO of the company it\u2019s pressuring the marketing area to elaborate campaigns targetting the most representative groups. The marketing team knows that you are the best fit to help them! So they set up a meeting to figure this out, after a short introduction of the situation, they quickly got to the point. \u201cWe are experts defining well-suited campaigns when we know the people we are trying to reach, but we need to first identify the most representative group of clients with a description of their behavior. Besides, we know that these 6 features \u2014 they show you the csv file \u2014 best describe our customers, could you help us?\u201d.", "You feel in your lucky day, a project pushed by the CEO that easily fits into the standard clustering examples! It seems like a quick win! But two things are bothering you, the \u201cwith a description of their behavior\u201d and \u201c6 features\u201d lines keep resonating in your head, those two combined sentences are hunting you. Will you be able to solve this?.", "So, why I\u2019m writing this? Because I\u2019m passionate about the business use cases of all machine learning applications, and in this particular topic, I\u2019ve seen good intuitions and explainability on dimensionality reduction. Still, those techniques are not meant to explain the characteristics of each group.", "Despite we will train a model, this won\u2019t be the standard article explaining the math and discussing the better error measurements. The focus here will be thinking about the business use case around clustering!", "It\u2019s essential to establish that clustering is just a tool to achieve a determined business goal. The problem isn\u2019t to create the best clusters (it helps, though), or just to use machine learning. The problem, in our case, is that we want to understand who our customers are.", "The understanding of our customers might have great impacts, even on our company\u2019s strategy, but for today, let\u2019s use this just for our targeting case.", "In the sections above, I assumed that you know some basic concepts, in case you don\u2019t, I want to present my short definition of them to you. If you want to dig deeper, I will embed some resources below (here it\u2019s a good start also).", "If you know them, just skip this section.", "The power of combining all these concepts can be traduced in the identification of groups that even we didn\u2019t know existed. The algorithm\u2019s job is to assign a tag to the entity, and when all of them get one, it\u2019s our job to make this information valuable.", "I will straight-away show you our dataset because I want to exhibit some things around it soon. It was created using Numpy and Pandas, but I won\u2019t reveal the construction process until the end. You know that the thrilling part of understanding our customers is not knowing them at first. I know that you don\u2019t like spoilers!", "As we discussed, this dataset is thought to replicate an E-commerce, every row is referred to a particular customer. Let\u2019s begin by understanding the features (here is the repo).", "ID: Unique identifier of the customer.", "n_clicks: The total number of clicks on products.", "n_visits: The total number of visits to the page.", "amount_spent: The total USD$ spent on products.", "amount_discount: The total USD$ spent on products with a discount (this value is meant to be less or equal than amount_spent).", "days_since_registration: The days that have been passed since the customer registration.", "profile_information: A measurement between 0 and 100 of how much the customer has filled their profile information.", "Great! Now we feel ready to start the mission that was entrusted to us. Plotly it\u2019s great for visualization! The simplicity, the beauty, and the professional aspect of the charts are perfect for getting a better sense of our data. The px.scatter_matrix method can give us a taste of our entire dataset.", "As you could know, it\u2019s easy to interpret the results when there are 2 or even 3 features. That\u2019s probably because our standard space representation fits in 2d or 3d charts, which (for us) makes total sense.", "When the number of features surpasses the capabilities of our 3-dimensional mindset, there are still some options. We can define features like the color or the size in our charts. For example, to capture 4 of our 6 features, I will show you an example using Plotly express.", "Interesting! We can see that the biggest circles are around the left-down zone. Also, we can notice a positive correlation between \u201cn_clicks\u201d and \u201cn_visits.\u201d For the \u201cdays_since_registration\u201d feature, the color doesn\u2019t seem to be clearly correlated with anything.", "Did you feel four features are manageable? Let\u2019s try five!", "Now we can see a group in the down corner, but trying to make sense of the 3-d plot plus the color and size information is kind of overwhelming. Imagine this process after creating clusters, which add one dimension because of the label (usually added as the color), we can know for sure that this isn\u2019t going in the right way.", "This unconventional path for the exploratory data analysis using a multi-dimensional approach was to show you that it\u2019s possible, but not a recommended one to follow. It\u2019s hard to scale to more than six features, and it\u2019s even harder to understand everything that\u2019s actually happening.", "Now it\u2019s clear why having too many features is a problem. If it\u2019s hard to see those charts for us, imagine how hard it can be to present this to others. It\u2019s time for us to go to the next step: clustering!", "Because finding the optimal amount of clusters or reducing the inertia as much as it\u2019s possible is not the most important part today, I will show you the decision of the cluster number only based on the inertia and the \u201celbow rule\u201d.", "This process can be improved in so many ways, and I won\u2019t list them here, but it\u2019s good for you to know that creating your model should be a more rigorous process.", "If you are interested in the details about the inertia just visit the Scikit-learn\u2019s documentation.", "K-Means is a distance-based algorithm. Because of that, it\u2019s super important to normalize, standardize, or choose any other option in which the distance has some comparable meaning for all the columns. MinMaxScaler, it\u2019s an excellent tool for it.", "After scaling our dataset, we can evaluate our inertia on different cluster numbers. If we see the chart, we could say that the elbow is on 3 or 4. For simplicity, we will use 3.", "We are reaching the part where we will talk about the groups that we just found, but first, it\u2019s important to describe some differences between explaining your findings to your team versus other areas.", "PCA and t-SNE are techniques to reduce the number of features in your dataset. These two algorithms can help because we can get a visualization in fewer dimensions, which will lead us to an interpretation to determine if the groups are actually well-separated. It also helps in other cases, and in this particular one is super well explained \u2014 again \u2014 on Scikit-learn\u2019s documentation.", "\u201cInertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d). Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as Principal component analysis (PCA) prior to k-means clustering can alleviate this problem and speed up the computations.\u201d", "So why PCA and t-SNE won\u2019t help to explain our findings? Because those algorithms are for us! We can improve the results of our model if we use them! The new variables created by them aren\u2019t directly comparable to our original features. So, despite that this can help us, it won\u2019t help to communicate your findings to others.", "To avoid digressing too much, we won\u2019t be applying those algorithms to our dataset, but I encourage you to try them and see what happens with the clusters!", "In this section, we will finally describe what we found in a way that\u2019s easy for everyone in the organization. To keep it simple, we can just understand our customers by the mean of their characteristics, knowing that every variable is still scaled.", "Line_polar is perfectly suited to this task because a circle can handle as many variables as you want, and the lines inside are pretty intuitive!", "First, it\u2019s important to see the whole picture, to understand in context the variables that really differentiate our customers. It\u2019s clear that \u201cdays_since_registration\u201d and \u201cprofile_information\u201d are similar for every group. This means that we can subtract them from our analysis.", "It\u2019s also relevant to see how many people we have in each group.", "After that, it\u2019s important to understand the behavior of our customers on every variable. For example, if you look at the label 0, you can understand that they clicked, visited, and spent on discounts a lot less than the other groups, but they\u2019re \u2014 by far \u2014 the customer that bought the most.", "I will leave the description of the other customers to you because I know you get the idea. Our job isn\u2019t finished, though, until you present this to your marketing colleagues.", "Ok, now that you have shared the results, and it\u2019s well understood by everyone, the business use case could flourish.", "Analyzing \u201cthe spender\u201d cluster, the marketing team could say that a good strategy for them would be to recommend the most profitable products on their main page first! They seem to spend just a little time selecting their products, and we could assert that is because they really appreciate their time. You can support your new friend (line_polar) with an illustration describing your customer\u2019s main characteristics!", "Also, it\u2019s critical to facilitate a production environment to avoid the project remaining just in a \u201cgood to know\u201d and Excel sheets flying over the company! It\u2019s important to integrate those flows with the recommendations of your company\u2019s website.", "If you are interested I can make a tutorial for a simple Dash application with those same charts into production. It\u2019s a good tool to monetize the model results and to help with product adoption.", "A lot more could be said, but for now, the important thing is that you must be thinking about how to create a profitable campaign and try to deploy it.", "In case you\u2019re still curious about how the data was created, I will share with you the trick to create every cluster. You can have fun checking that a lot of the ones that were meant to be some type of customer, ended up in another cluster!", "I think that doing some better feature engineering and trying other algorithms might do the trick. If you have better results, share them in the comments!", "As you could have noticed, the groups were meant to belong to well-defined characteristics. In real life, there will be a lot of noisy data, and the customer clusters may be much higher.", "Also, the model development and the customer\u2019s description are oversimplified. The mean isn\u2019t the only measurement that you should be looking at.", "But that\u2019s all for today! I hope that this article will help you somehow. See you soon!", "If you liked it, follow me on Medium and Linkedin. If you want to write to me, I\u2019m recently on Twitter.
