Exploring that connection is essential to the process of learning. History is a great teacher, especially because, since things don\u2019t happen in a vacuum, it\u2019s usually wise to consider the present in relation to the past.", "There\u2019s a second, equally important connection, something of an instructive question mark between what\u2019s actual today and what\u2019s possible tomorrow, that can help to accelerate the learning process. To understand and guide what you do today, you should also ask about what you might do tomorrow.", "The advantage of following that learning arc is that you\u2019re able to connect knowledge from the past to context for the present and to questions about the potential of the future. It\u2019s an exercise we all do in our personal lives, the equivalent of, \u201cWhere have I been, how did I get here, and what am I capable of accomplishing?\u201d In technology, this process is especially important if you\u2019re trying to solve problems in a way that preserves as few blind spots as possible: if you wish to apply technology to solutions that endure, you need knowledge, context, curiosity \u2014 and perspective.", "This brings me to why I decided to launch a machine learning blog. Now that distributed systems and decentralized blockchains are being explored in earnest out in the market, one of the technology areas I want to better understand is that of machine learning. The reason is that we should begin to ask how data stored immutably in blockchains might be accessed and analyzed by AI software in the future to produce new insights and solutions to business, social, and other problems that we have today or might arise tomorrow.", "As part of my effort to learn about that intersection between data and analysis, I recently embarked on a learning journey about a space I knew nothing about: machine learning. Having spent a year learning about and working in the blockchain space, and having spent many months regularly learning about cryptography on my own, I\u2019d developed an appreciation for the power of open-sourcing your learning journeys: sharing what you\u2019re learning, thinking about, and asking. By doing so, not only do you learn more quickly, but also you\u2019re able to share the spoils of that accelerated learning process with other people.", "Below, I\u2019ve cross-posted the first three of my daily blog entries from A Human Learning Machine Learning. Thanks for joining me on this learning journey.", "(Cross-posted from My Open-Source Machine Learning Journey Begins)", "Earlier today on LinkedIn, I wrote the following:", "2018 was a year of learning\u20262019 will be a year of dual-wielding, of learning and applying: learning more about distributed systems and decentralized blockchains, learning about machine learning, experimenting with applications, applying my heart to clearer goals, learning to apply ever-stronger curiosity to my mission, and allowing myself to fully explore my hunches.", "A little over one year ago, I began to learn about blockchains, distributed ledgers, and cryptography. Once you learn the basics of what makes these work together, it\u2019s easy to become excited about the future of information. In a world that will increasingly rely on ways to store, access, distribute, and analyze data from a combination of centralized, distributed, and decentralized stores, the essential follow-up question becomes, \u201cHow will humans use data to build machines that help advance the aims of our societies?\u201d", "This thinking prompted me two weeks ago to consider what else I should be learning in the year(s) ahead, which includes machine learning itself. Believing as I do that technology can and should be used for good, and that we ought to use our best ideas in service of our best ideals, I can\u2019t help but try to understand such an important piece of modern technology\u2019s surface area, namely the intersection of machine learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and our chosen tomorrow.", "As I wrote in the rest of today\u2019s LinkedIn post:", "\u201cIn a time of such great problems, we can\u2019t afford not to throw ourselves, with great delight and strong conviction, at reducing the number of mysteries that barr human progress.\u201d", "In this blog, my aim is to \u201copen-source my learning journey in machine learning\u201d, so that my current peers and future generations can see what it\u2019s like a for a human to learn about a technology that will someday power many foundations of the human experience. As I\u2019ve recently started to read about machine learning, to ask questions, and to ponder the unknown, this space is to serve as part diary, part blog, and part playground to build and share my neural networks in the future. The wonderful thing about the human learning process is that it is one part neuroscience and one part magic, the output of the work of our biological neurons tussling and wrestling with connections, ideas, dead ends, mistakes, breakthroughs, awe, wonder, curiosity, memories, problems, and the dual selective pressures of life and imagination. Someday, in the very far-off future, long after I\u2019m gone, humanity may create learning machines capable of appreciating all the joys contained in that previous sentence. Until then, I and we have a lot to learn about the human mind, about computers, about data, and how that data can be used to train computers to make better predictions on our behalf.", "What will I find in this machine learning journey of the mind?", "(Cross-posted from Resources for the Newcomer to Machine Learning)", "Learning how to learn something new is always tricky. It\u2019s a bit like figuring out how to build a shelf to put new knowledge on before you know what kind of knowledge you\u2019ll acquire, how long or high the shelves should be, or which tools you\u2019ll need to build the shelves themselves.", "I guess sometimes the best way to start is to, well, start. You build as you go, and you ask to borrow tools as needed or help building shelves when you need to. You also determine what\u2019s irrelevant to your aims or too far beyond your current knowledge horizon to be useful now. That\u2019s the game of unstructured trial and error \u2014 the human version of reinforcement learning. But first, you must start.", "One way to divide the start is by segment, i.e., by source or type of resource:", "Below are some of the machine learning resources that I\u2019ve come across so far or have been suggested to me. This list is unprioritized and inexhaustive. It is a snapshot in time, so I do not anticipate adding to this list in the future.", "(Cross-posted from Should Machines Learn to Process Speech before They Learn to Process Text?)", "Today I asked a question in a comment on LinkedIn. My question was, essentially, if there is an advantage to teaching machine learning models to process speech before we teach them to process text. Let me walk you through my reasoning.", "Dr. Matt Wood of Amazon recently wrote a blog post announcing that AWS Machine Learning can be used by developers to build natural language processing models into their applications. This relies on a service called Amazon Comprehend, which, as the name implies, can analyze text and perform reading comprehension-related tasks. The service is trained with deep learning models and is able to detect certain words, perform sentiment analysis on the language of the text, or even categorize the text by certain topics. Dr. Wood\u2019s announcement was about a new capability for Comprehend: 1) the ability to further tailor the service\u2019s searches to a particular organization\u2019s lexicon, and 2) the ability to sort documents into custom classifications (i.e., categories). Apparently, this type of search-and-analyze is not easy to do, which is why using a machine learning service like Comprehend is useful. This all falls within a category of applied machine learning called natural language processing.", "Wood\u2019s blog post reminded me of something I\u2019ve seen in Alpaydin\u2019s text, Machine Learning: bag of words. Bag of words is a technique used to figure out whether or not text shows up inside a given document and then sort that document into a category based on its contents. This is one of the techniques used for spam filtering, for example.", "The day before Wood\u2019s post, Nino Bice of AWS Artificial Intelligence wrote a post titled \u201cGetting Started with Amazon Comprehend custom entities\u201d. In it, Bice describes how the Entities data type now supports \u201cprivate, custom entity types\u201d, specific to an organization, that map to individual words of importance to that organization. Think of this as making the machine learning model more attuned to the language used within a company (or an industry such as healthcare) that is using an app powered by Comprehend\u2019s APIs. The organization\u2019s custom text data trains Comprehend\u2019s natural language processing model in order to better predict how to classify documents or text when the customer\u2019s models are exposed to those documents or texts in the future, after the learning models have been trained with the customer\u2019s data set. Presumably, the bag of words technique is used somewhere in the process.", "At this point, it\u2019s helpful to point to a page in Alpaydin\u2019s book (p. 103, Fig 4.2) describing how something called hierarchical processing works. Basically, if you feed an image of text to a computer, and you want that computer to be able to recognize what word is contained in the image, it does that by using models trained to perform hierarchical processing, which begins by detecting the visual primitives of letters, \u201csuch as arcs and line segments\u201d. Alpaydin\u2019s Figure 4.2 shows how two curves make an o, one vertical line makes an l, and so on. In hierarchical processing, the machine would process the pixels that make up those primitives, then combine those primitives into single letters to process, then determine if a given word has a combination of letters that it has learned to recognize, and, finally, identity \u201cmore abstract relationships such as the relationship between \u201cbook\u201d and [the French equivalent] \u201clivre\u201d\u201d. Fascinating.", "I recall learning as a young boy how to write the letters o, l, and all the rest on big, manuscript ruled D\u2019Nealian paper. The goal of those scholastic routines must be to teach us to learn, identify, and write all the visual primitives of all the letters in the alphabet, which perhaps improves our ability to subsequently learn, identify, and read all the letters of the alphabet (I can\u2019t recall if we learn to read or write first).", "However, most of us learn to do something else before we learn to read or write: we learn to speak. Speech, like letters, has its own primitives, except that they\u2019re oral (when transmitted) and aural (when received) rather than visual:", "Alpaydin (p. 67): \u201cJust as we consider each character image to be composed of basic primitives like strokes of different orientations, a word is considered to be a sequence of phonemes, which are the basic speech sounds. In the case of speech, the input is temporal; words are uttered in time as a sequence of these phonemes, and some words are longer than others.\u201d", "We as humans begin to master the phonemes of speech before we master the visual primitives of letters and how they come together to form written words. This brings me to my question.", "Since humans learn to listen and speak before we learn to read or write, I wonder if there would be some computational or other advantage to training speech learning models on speech data before training natural language processing models on text data, especially of the same words spoken as written, in order to improve efficiency or accuracy. I just don\u2019t yet know enough about how either of these work to have an answer.", "Further, is there is a speech recognition equivalent to the bag-of-words technique used for text classification of documents? Could such a \u201cbag-of-spoken-words\u201d technique be used in combination with techniques for written text improve the models\u2019 predictions?", "\u2026would there be a way to take a list of written words that would normally be used to train models for text classification, speak the words aloud and record them, put the speech data through a speech recognition algorithm to train a speech recognition NLP model, and then use the results to train Amazon Comprehend for text classification? Reason I ask is that in human learning, when we learn to read words, we likely associate the visual primitives of the letters with the speech primitives of the spoken versions of those letters, which I suppose accelerates the ability to read and process words because we can speak their spoken counterparts. Thus, I wonder if in machine learning we are yet approaching things in a similar way, coupling NLP for text with NLP for speech during the training process.", "[3] Amazon Comprehend FAQs and Entity \u2014 AWS", "[5] \u201cNatural language processing\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia", "[6] \u201cBag-of-words model\u201d and \u201cNaive Bayes spam filtering\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia", "[7] Amazon Comprehend Medical \u2014 AWS", "And there you have it, blogs #1\u20133 on my new machine learning blog, A Human Learning Machine Learning.
