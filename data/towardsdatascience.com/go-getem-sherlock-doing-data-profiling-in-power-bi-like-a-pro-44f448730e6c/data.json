Personally, I adore them. And, when I was younger, I admired Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot so much, that I wanted to become like them when I grow up :)", "What were these two characters best in? They could infallible profile the people, collect the facts based on that profiling, so in the end, everything looked so easy and obvious \u2014 like anyone can do that!", "Honestly, my detective skills were not even close enough to be successful in that \u201cjob\u201d. But, instead of profiling people, I decided to profile the data\u2026", "According to Ralph Kimball, data profiling is a systematic upfront analysis of the content of a data source. There are multiple keywords in this sentence, but let\u2019s just focus on a few of them:", "There are multiple types of data profiling techniques:", "The main benefit of performing data profiling is to improve the quality of your data. That way, you can, for example, spot if there are letters in your phone number column, or if the ZIP code doesn\u2019t match the expected pattern.", "Additionally, you can catch if some outlier pops-up within your data. Simply imagine that you have a column which contains the individual price of different fruits \u2014 and let\u2019s say that this ranges between 1 and 1000. But, all of a sudden, you notice the value of 1.000.000 (someone made a mistake, or whatever). Now, imagine your report showing the average price of the fruits! I bet you would not expect to see that apples, oranges or bananas have an average price of few thousands:)", "Finally, you should aim to know your data before putting it in front of your users\u2019 eyes. Because, based on data distribution and other characteristics of your columns, you can easier decide which visuals to use, or if it is necessary to apply some additional steps for data cleansing or data transformation.", "Studying the nuances of your data and finding anomalies in the underlying structures can make your report shine and more accurate at the same time.", "One of the things I like most in Power BI is that it gives you a possibility, not only to create appealing visualizations but also to shape your data prior to that.", "That being said, when it comes to data profiling, Power BI has a lot to offer. Even more, it enables you to perform data profiling in quite user-friendly way, since it has some built-in functionalities that will make your \u201cData-Sherlock\u201d job much easier.", "I\u2019ll share with you some tips regarding data profiling, that I apply in my day-to-day work.", "The first thing I prefer to do, is to open the data model in Model tab within Power BI Desktop:", "This way, I\u2019m getting familiar with the tables, I can identify key columns, relationships between the tables, types of relationships (1:1, 1:M; active/inactive), etc. That gives me a nice overview of the data model, so I can focus on specific things later.", "The next step is turning on the Power Query editor, where most of the data profiling occurs. So, let\u2019s see how it\u2019s done:", "Under the View tab, turn on Column distribution, Column profile, and Column quality options. Once you select a specific column, you should be able to see your data profiled. Even more, it\u2019s being displayed in a nice and human-readable way, so you can quickly get a detailed overview of the underlying data!", "This way, Power BI (or Power Query to be more precise), helps you spot the outliers, anomalies, or any other unexpected \u201cbehavior\u201d of your data.", "Let\u2019s now examine what all of these visuals display:", "Additionally, when applied to numeric columns, Column Statistics will also include the number of zeroes and NULLs, but also some statistical functions, such as the average value, standard deviation, and distribution between even and odd numbers.", "Having all these stats can help you understand data distribution and support you if you decide to additionally transform or clean the data.", "One of the greatest challenges in modern data warehousing is to achieve the highest possible level of data quality. And, the first (and the most important) step on this path is data profiling.", "Going back where we started \u2014 with Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot \u2014 as they were able to spot fine nuances and identify some unusual behavior (outlier) during their investigations, that brought them success in the end!", "To wrap-up: spend some time being a \u201cSherlock\u201d or \u201cPoirot\u201d before you switch your focus to building nice visuals within the report.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
