One market theory is the January Barometer that states January\u2019s performance dictates the market\u2019s performance for the rest of the year. In other words, if returns in January are positive then most likely the rest of the year will be too. I wanted to test this theory on index level and sector level. Does the hypothesis work well on S&P 500 or NASDAQ composite or Russell 2000? Is this theory more successfully in certain sectors than others? And, what can we expect this year in 2020, could the indicator work with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak?", "Let\u2019s dive in the data to figure it out!", "Python makes it very easy to get data that I need for my analysis. The two packages I used to get financial data are Quandl and pandas_datareader.", "Quandl is a financial library of many datasets, which you can access some of them for free if you sign up. By installing the package in Python, you can directly call the data into a dataframe. Below is how I retrieved S&P composite data.", "I also used pandas_datareader to get Yahoo Finance data because Quandl did not have much historical data for what I was looking for. Pandas_datareader is a neat library that allows you to extract data from websites. Below is an example of how I retrieved historical NASQAD composite prices.", "Using S&P composite data from Yale Department of Economics, dating from 1872 to present day, I calculated the return for January and the return from February to December for each year. Of the 148 years, January returns were positive 98 times. Among those 98 times, the return from February to December was also positive 65 times. Overall, there were 91 occurrences when January return successfully predicted the rest of the year return, with a success rate of 61.49%.", "Figure 1 below shows the 91 times when the hypothesis worked. When following the January Barometer, the year 1933 and 1879 had the highest Feb-Dec returns of 40.6% and 37.4%, respectively. The barometer also helped to avoid market losses. For example, in 2008, 1907, and 1917, the indicator was negative, signaling to not invest. In those years, the market actually dipped the most with Feb-Dec returns of -36.4%, -31.3%, and -28.9% respectively.", "This is how I made Figure 1:", "Figure 2 below shows the 57 times when the January barometer failed. When following the indicator, investors may miss out on large market gains. For example, it would be wise not to follow the theory in 1927 and 2009 when the barometer predicted a negative year, but the rest of the year return was actually positive, 30.3% and 28.3%, respectively. On the flip side, the barometer could also be risky where it predicts a positive year, but the year ends up negative. For instance, in 1931, January returned a positive 3.1%, but the rest of the year yield a large dip of -47.1%.", "Using Yahoo Finance data of the daily closed prices of NASDAQ composite, Dow Jones index, and Russell 2000 index, I applied the barometer to see its performance. In Figure 3, total return represents the annualized return if remained invested throughout all the years in the data, ignoring the barometer. Barometer return is the annualized return if a investor only invested in years when January return was positive (assuming no investment in January). Interestingly, by following the January Barometer theory, the investor will enjoy a greater return than ignoring the indicator. The success rate for each index was better than a coin flip, with the highest success rate coming from the NASDAQ composite (67%). Regardless of an index of 30 securities or 500 securities or large cap technology companies or small cap companies, the January Barometer performed well.", "Using 21 years of S&P500 Sector data from Yahoo Finance, I found the barometer\u2019s strength on each sector. The theory worked the best on the Healthcare and Utilities sectors, which a success rate of 67% and 62%, respectively. Financial sector performed the worst with a mere 38% success rate.", "The following code is how I made the combo bar and line chart, which clearly shows the trend and relationship between years correctly predicted and success rate:", "If ignoring the indicator and being invested for all 21 years, the annualized return was the greatest for the consumer discretionary sector (6.6%). Consumer discretionary sector was the only sector that performed better when ignoring the barometer (6.6%) than following the theory (6.1%). All other sectors yielded a higher return when investing in only the years that the barometer predicted a positive year. Utilities sector had the strongest average barometer return of 10.1% while financials produced the lowest return of -1.8%.", "Statistically speaking, a confusion matrix is a visual that shows the error of a predication model. I calculated the four metrics: true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. True positive is when barometer correctly predicted a positive year. False positive is when the barometer incorrectly predicted a positive year, making an investor to lose money. False negative is January return was negative, but the rest of the year return was positive, thereby investor missed out on a profitable investment. True negative is when the barometer correctly predicted a negative year, helping the investor to avoid a bad investment. True positives and True negatives measure the success of the January Barometer theory. False positives and false negatives measure the error in the indicator. Materials sector had the most false negative cases where investors missed out on a good investment. Financials had the most false positives where the investor lost gains in the portfolio.", "With the current COVID 19 outbreak, I was curious to see the performance of the January Barometer on past epidemics and pandemics. Using LiveScience.com as a reference, I took the last 8 outbreaks and found the S&P 500 January return and February to December return for the first year of the disease breaking out. January Barometer worked on 5 of the 8 outbreaks, making the success rate 62.5%. In 2020, January return was negative (-0.99%), so the rest of the year return may likely be negative as well if following the indicator. In 2009, when the Swine Flu emerged, January return was negative but the rest of the year return was the highest compared to the other outbreaks. However, this was largely due to the central bank\u2019s unconventional monetary policy of quantitative easing. This is comparable to today where the Federal Reserve is using the same monetary tool. Despite what the barometer predicts, with Fed intervention in 2020, the markets may experience a boom.", "Overall, January Barometer does work and following it, returns are higher than ignoring it. However, investors should use it with caution because many other factors such as Fed\u2019s monetary actions and geopolitical factors also impact the market.", "Your home for data science.
