With the earliest encounter of Alexander Graham Bell using his telephone to get assistance when he spilled acid on his trousers to your mom calling the doctor when you spiked a fever, telehealth has evolved dramatically over the years. Today, high-speed Internet, video-conferencing, and IoT devices make telehealth more plausible.", "COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way we interact, and telemedicine is rapidly becoming a new normal with virtual doctor consultations. For example, Babylon Health has been rapidly expanding in the UK with doctor-patient video chat, consultation history, and illness reporting. Unsurprisingly, the platform has been experiencing a surge in popularity with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the healthcare industry and technology continues to evolve, it begs the question: what role can artificial intelligence play in Telehealth?", "The first chatbots date back to the 1960s. One of the first prominent chatbots was ELIZA, creating a parody of an initial psychiatric interview. Since 2010, the majority of chatbots used have been for customer service. Instead of searching user documentation if there was an error in the software or you wanted to report feedback, you could use the chatbot that would steer you in the right direction. However, chatbots are just now starting to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry.", "For people who are used to immediate information, using existing chatbots like Alexa, Siri, and Facebook Messenger to answer questions and improve contact with medical professionals can strengthen the relationship between the provider and patient. Existing chatbots offer services such as scheduling appointments, locating healthcare facilities, and encouraging clinical trials.", "In addition, increasing patient engagement can help address specific issues. In one instance, an AI solution helped reduce \u201cno-shows\u201d for colonoscopies. Chatbots help match consumers existing expectations in our \u201con-demand\u201d society and improve the patient experience.", "More recently, AI chatbots have started transforming patient diagnoses and at-home self care. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there\u2019s a need for self-treatment to reduce the spread of disease and the burden on healthcare professionals.", "How does it work? Let\u2019s say you get a headache and start developing chills. You take your temperature and you have a mild-grade fever. Do you take an Advil? Do you go to the doctor? A chatbot will check your symptoms, asking the same screening questions a healthcare professional would to rule-out conditions. Natural language processing is used after telling the chatbot your symptoms, and providing you with possible diagnoses. Simply put, we don\u2019t necessarily know the right questions to ask. A chatbot can help identify underlying symptoms that you might not have realized.", "Instead of a patient on WebMD matching their own symptoms, a chatbot can help them narrow down the potential causes with heightened accuracy.", "Buoy Health was right 92 percent of the time, compared to WebMD\u2019s 56 percent, Healthline\u2019s 53 percent and Mayo Clinic\u2019s 38 percent", "For example Ada Health is a chatbot that does exactly that. If you\u2019re feeling unwell, Ada \u201casks\u201d you a series of increasingly specific questions about your symptoms. The app provides you with likelihood metrics when reviewing possible causes, and avenues you can take as next steps. Moreover, Ada lets you track your symptoms if they escalate to share with a healthcare provider.", "All together, these features help patients more accurately deduce their illnesses, allowing people to take better measures of self-care and preventing possible hysteria. Moreover, healthcare chatbots help provide diverse and personalized resources. For example, Youper is a chatbot that provides patients with personalized resources for mental health. The AI can suggest techniques to monitor your progress, measure wellness, and share information with your healthcare professional. Similarly, a cancer chatbot built into Facebook messenger provides up-to-date resources for cancer patients, caregivers, and families. Unlike simply reading static information online, tailoring the resources to a patient\u2019s needs can be very beneficial.", "Using a vast database has the possibility to provide more accurate information because of the data-driven approach. Buoy Health, another chatbot for self-care diagnosis, uses vast amounts of data in their solution. Similar to other chatbots, it provides a text-based symptom checker to match your inputs with possible conditions. The company trained using clinical data from 18,000 medical papers (5M patients, 1,700 conditions) to mirror a physician.", "For instance, before Buoy Health was launched, one of the tests it conducted was how it would interpret a cough. According to the CEO Le, \u201cThey examined 100 standardized cases involving 33 different diagnoses, ranging from a benign cough to life-threatening pulmonary embolism, as well as prevalence of rare diseases like histoplasmosis to a common cold. Buoy was right 92 percent of the time, compared to WebMD\u2019s 56 percent, Healthline\u2019s 53 percent and Mayo Clinic\u2019s 38 percent.\u201d (Source)", "Moreover, Buoy learns from its users over time, measuring symptom prevalence. The company is using the software to gather large amounts of data that could not be measured in traditional studies. Buoy Health hasn\u2019t published many research articles on the data they\u2019ve learned from their platform thus far, but they do have a team of staff writers creating published content for symptom diagnosis.", "For more minor health problems, chatbots can prevent a trip to the doctor entirely. Statistically, 78% of patients visiting the emergency room could have been taken care of out of the ER. Your.MD is an AI chatbot with a primary feature called a Self-Care Checker. It determines whether the symptoms you\u2019re experiencing warrant a doctor\u2019s visit or you are simply experiencing a self-care condition such as the common cold or allergies. It can expedite triaging patients and deliver a more personalized experience for the patient. However, it also then provides quick access to healthcare providers in your area if the chatbot determines your conditions are more serious", "There are many \u201chidden\u201d benefits of not visiting a doctor as well. Aside from the time-saved, depending on insurance a visit to the doctor can be costly. Chatbots like Ada, Buoy, and Your.MD are free to use. Interestingly enough, these chatbots generate revenue from referring you to healthcare facilities. Without visiting a doctor, you prevent spreading the disease by staying home. On the flip-side, you also limit your own exposure from potentially catching another disease at the healthcare facility. In addition, unlike family doctors and urgent-care facilities, a chatbot is available 24/7. Even for simple medical issues, it\u2019s a nice convenience to be able to use if you wake up with chills in the middle of the night.", "A chatbot lacks the personal touch and gut-feeling doctors give. Even though people aren\u2019t hesitant to use a chatbot for basic customer support, many will be reluctant to use a chatbot to discuss sensitive medical information.", "Conversa Health is a chatbot that streamlines the customer-service and administration between patients and providers. CEO Kouris Kalligas is an advocate for healthcare innovation but reminds others in the field that they need to be cognizant about existing constraints in the system.", "\u201cInnovators should remember [that] it\u2019s plausible need that drives the development of the technology, not just what\u2019s technically possible.\u201d", "\u2014 Kouris Kalligas, CEO Conversa Health", "In the past few years, companies like Marriot, MyFitnessPal, Target, and MyHeritage have all experienced significant data breaches. Especially with sensitive medical data, providing secure solutions and safeguarding techniques to make sure data doesn\u2019t end up in the wrong hands is critical.", "Your.MD is registered as a class 1 medical device, complying with EU Medical Device directives to be used as an adjunct to the process of a doctor. It states that the services legally do not provide diagnoses, medical advice, or treatment. Even though a chatbot theoretically would provide a more tailored conclusion than a self-research using Google. More-so are the obvious practical limitations. With medical equipment and procedures, a chatbot can only touch the surface in diagnosing and solving medical maladies.", "As mentioned previously, chatbots limitations will prevent them from fully replacing a doctor. As AI chatbots improve and become increasingly mainstream, chatbots and doctors working together could be a reality. For instance, Sensely currently offers solutions to healthcare providers to offer patient services and health assessments. It helps care facilities offer dynamic check-in services for scheduling appointments and help consumers navigate insurance claims. Moreover, it provides doctors with real-time information from patient behavior through questionnaires and feedback.", "These types of \u201cwaiting-room questionnaires\u201d have been around for decades, but a chatbot solution could provide more personalized questions geared toward the patients habits, automatically attach itself to the patient record, and give doctors an immediate picture of the patients pre-screened health status.", "In addition, chatbots have other significant limitations such as treatment of infants and elderly people, where the patients aren\u2019t able to use the technology. However, as technology develops, chatbots can help substitute even the most basic tasks. As chatbots will do the menial tasks, and doctors will use the chatbot\u2019s resources to come up with a diagnosis. With less stress on the doctors and nurses, they will be able to see more patients that require critical treatment that an AI chatbot cannot provide.", "Chatbots interwoven in the healthcare industry obviously applies the concept of social good. However it\u2019s important to always consider the extent the technology can help, and where implementing technology can hinder the overall user-experience. In addition, it\u2019s frequently mentioned that Medtech startups get high levels of funding by venture-capital firms. It\u2019s important to see through the smoke to see which companies are delivering the most accurate results.", "Given how some aspects of the medical industry are archaic, while others are incredibly advanced, improving the overall patient experience to provide accurate medical information is something chatbots can make an impact.", "While the global pandemic is putting immense stress on the healthcare systems, it will be interesting to see if there is a rise in use of chatbots. Many primary-care facilities and special-care doctors have switched remotely during the pandemic. More and more people have become comfortable reaching out to their doctors and sharing intimate details about their health over video. Doctors have also become more comfortable treating patients in a way that would have been seen as \u201cimproper\u201d just a few months ago. However, some specialities (orthopedics, for example), will face challenges providing patients with virtual care.", "With many corporations considering switching to remote environments permanently, the healthcare industry will continue to evolve. This will be the ultimate test for Telehealth to see if procedures such as virtual-consultations, patient engagement platforms, and self-care chatbots will continue in the aftermath of the pandemic.", "Peter Luba (@peterluba) is a CS + Design student at Lehigh University.
