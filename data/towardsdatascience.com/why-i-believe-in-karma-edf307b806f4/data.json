I think that you should believe in Karma because Karma is a number\u2019s game. It\u2019s a simple probabilistic phenomenon.", "Let\u2019s take the probabilistic approach and make this mathematically rigorous.", "A random person may believe in Karma (K) or may not believe in Karma (NK). Also, a random person may act in a good way (G) or may act in a bad way (NG).", "Since a person either believes in Karma or does not believe in Karma, the probabilities of the events K and NK add up to 1. Since we classify acts to be either good or bad (I know, those mathematicians,\u2026), the probabilities of the events G and NG also add up to 1.", "And if somebody believes in Karma, I think it is safe to assume, that on average, they will act in a good way more often than they will act in a bad way. We denote the probability that somebody who believes in Karma does something good by P(G|K) and the probability that somebody who does not believe in Karma does something good by P(G|NK).", "Thus we have the following events with the associated probabilities:", "By our assumption that people who believe in Karma act better on average, P(G|NK)<P(G|K).", "Given all of the above probabilities (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll punch in numbers soon to make this clearer), how can we calculate P(G) \u2014 the probability of a random person doing a good act?", "We can determine this probability from the conditional probabilities by using the \u201cLaw of Total Probability\u201d which directly follows from the definition of the conditional probability.", "Then the Law of Total Probability is given by", "We can even draw a graph of the last formula where we can directly see how P(G) changes as P(K) changes. In our linear equation, P( G|NK) is the y-axis intersection and the difference P(G|K)-P( G|NK) the slope.", "Imagine Tom, a pretty average guy. He surrounds himself with chilled out people who all believe that good things will come back to them and most of them believe in Karma, i.e. we choose a high probability for K, for example, P(K)=0.8.", "Then there is also Paul. Paul\u2019s surroundings are a bit different from Tom\u2019s. The people around Paul prefer to be selfish and very few of them believe in Karma, i.e. we choose a low probability for K, for example, P(K)=0.2.", "So what happens if we punch in the numbers?", "The probability that something good happens to Tom is given by 0.82 or 82%.", "The probability that something good happens to Paul is given by 0.58 or 58%.", "Generally speaking, P(K) is a probability, thus it will always take values between 0 and 1. As we saw above, the probability P(G) is a function that depends linearly on P(K). Therefore, P(G) will always take values between 0.4 (if P(K)=0) and 0.9 (if P(K)=1) for the given probabilities of P(G|K) and P(G|NK). We can also see this in the above diagram.", "See? There\u2019s a difference. It makes sense to surround yourself with people who believe that good acts will \u2014 at least on average \u2014 lead to more good acts and come back to you. Karma is a number\u2019s game and I choose to believe in it.", "You don\u2019t even need Math for this to make sense. You could also just use common sense.", "But having Math back this conjecture makes it even more beautiful, don\u2019t you think?", "Your home for data science.
