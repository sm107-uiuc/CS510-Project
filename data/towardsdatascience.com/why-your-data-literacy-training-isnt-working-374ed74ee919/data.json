Duncan, Vice President at Gartner", "The recent rise of big data and data science has been lavishly enjoyed by the data specialist. But to those without formal training, using data remains as elusive and intimidating as ever.", "It\u2019s no surprise then, that great companies (e.g. AirBnB, NYT) are now turning their sights on making the rest of their company better with data. The trend has been referred to as \u201cimproving data literacy\u201d, or even \u201cestablishing a data culture\u201d.", "Regardless of what we call it, both are attempts to solve the same problem: How do I get my employees to use data better [so that my data team has time to do more valuable things]?", "For the last 2 years we\u2019ve been asking companies how they make their data more accessible. As a team we\u2019ve got our own battle scares from championing data in companies big and small, high and low tech. From all that research and experience, we\u2019ve found most data training programs look the same:", "The objective of these sessions is for people to be able to query the datasources themselves and get the info they need. Unfortunately, the actual outcomes are that within a few months:", "So most attendees end up in the same place they were a few months earlier, except everyone\u2019s a little more cynical.", "We\u2019ve been running our own data training sessions for the last 6 months now. With over 500 people trained and many of them taking the material back to their own companies, we\u2018ve collated a few things that could make your data training program the one that sticks:", "Instead of saying \u201clet me teach you\u2026\u201d try \u201chow can I help you\u2026?\u201d", "By starting a \u2018data literacy initiative\u2019, you\u2019re making your colleagues feel like it\u2019s all their fault. You\u2019re essentially saying \u201cif you guys knew a little more about data, it would make everything better\u201d, which, whilst maybe true, is not particularly inspiring. (How would you react if someone called you illiterate in something?)", "Most people in your company will agree they would love to do more with data, and likely feel a strong sense that they should for their careers. So instead of focusing on remedying deficiencies, make it about the benefits and opportunities that come from learning more about data.", "Suddenly, the tone of the session changes from \u201cyou have to learn this\u201d to \u201clet\u2019s see what we can do together.\u201d It\u2019s a simple, but powerful change that can get even the fiercest data curmudgeon onboard.", "Instead of running a training session on how to write SQL, run one about asking data-driven questions.", "You will not get everyone in the company to love data as much as you do. You will not even get people to stop asking you for reports all the time.", "But, if you focus on it, you can make significant changes. Obviously, each company will have their own initiatives, but one I think every company should have is: asking good questions. Instead of getting vague questions like \u201ccan you send me last month\u2019s sales data?\u201d, you can receive more actionable and targeted questions like, \u201cI\u2019d like to see if our new social media campaign hit our target of 10% increase YoY in leads.\u201d The former is vague and devoid of any business significance. The latter is specific and demonstrates the requestor knows exactly what they\u2019re looking for. More importantly, an analyst can add value to the second statement by recommending considerations to take with the data, or help with the analysis.", "The bottom line is: the best companies ask the best questions.", "Instead of a 2-week intensive, try weekly lunch-and-learn sessions.", "Weeklong intensive sessions are certainly appealing when considering this type of training \u2014 they create a focused environment that almost always deliver tangible results. However, the long term effects of these programs are reduced if regular, cultural changes don\u2019t follow.", "The opportunity with these types of sessions isn\u2019t just to make the business user more competent with data, but to make the business better with data. This means the more time the data teams and the business teams work together, the better.", "For this we suggest making data a more expected part of people\u2019s lives. Have quarterly KPI reviews, or optional lunch and learn sessions where people can ask their data questions. Be creative with it, but make it last!", "Making data more accessible in your company has incredible potential to transform your business, and we believe it is definitely worth the investment. Before you get going designing a program, consider your company\u2019s and your participants\u2019 objectives, and the find the best way to meet them. Challenge yourself to make it more than a 2-week SQL course, and instead something that makes a lasting impact on your company and culture.", "For the last 2 years we\u2019ve set our sights on making data more accessible to everyone.
