To get a very strong grasp of SQL, start by experimenting, writing stupid queries to no end, solving mathematics puzzles using queries, creating a random game of chess using a query and whatnot. Of course, you\u2019ll probably not get a chance to do any of this while at work so take time out, especially if you\u2019re early stages of your career as a data person. And obviously, do it on your own machine.", "Understanding how where clauses are evaluated, how subqueries work, how ordering works and how nulls behave in a database are some of the things you\u2019ll get a deeper understanding of if you experiment. Doing this will also prepare for any trick questions that you get asked during interviews. However, it is not very fashionable to ask tricky questions in interviews these days.", "As a start, look at this example \u2014 all of SQL comes down to the efficient use of WHERE clause. It is important to understand how it behaves.", "When you use integers in the WHERE clause, it represents integers but when you use integers in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses, the integers represent the positional number of the column in your result set (not in the table). It\u2019s another lazy trick to write the queries faster. However, it is recommended that you not use GROUP BY 1, 3 ORDER BY 1 DESC as it leaves room for inducing errors while someone else edits the query in the future, especially if it is a complex query. How about some nulls?", "For most databases, you\u2019d find a dedicated piece of documentation talking about how to handle nulls. Here\u2019s a piece from MySQL\u2019s official documentation talking about working with nulls and another one with information about problems/issues with nulls. Reading these you can find out that you cannot use equality or comparison operators with null values.", "Moving on. Understanding logical operators is really important to write SQL queries. Most SQL engines support all major local operators like AND, OR, NOT, XOR. Although we don\u2019t see their alternatives being used in the where clause, we can definitely write a query like this \u2014", "I made some interesting discoveries here. Using tilde with an integer will just subtract that number from the biggest integer possible in the database and return the result. But if you select ~ alone, it will give you an error. Regarding the interchangeability of AND and &&, it is recommended that you use AND instead of && or vice-versa throughout the codebase so as to have decent readability. It could be confusing otherwise. Also, everyone\u2019s favorite tool search & replace won\u2019t work properly.", "Another point about logical operators is that they support all the logical math that comes with them. For instance, SELECT NOT NOT 1 will give us 1. What happens when we do SELECT NOT NOT 'Nice'. Here are a couple of examples to demonstrate.", "When used with mathematical operators, logical operators should be separated by parentheses or the database engine won\u2019t recognise the logical operator and consider it as a string and will throw an error.", "I find this method of exploring database behaviour really fascinating. Most of the queries that have been written use the aforementioned principles which are built into the database engine, most of the databases deal with null values, but do we understand how the database is actually reading and interpreting our queries? I submit that to understand databases deeper, one has to go through such random queries. They are like math puzzles but obviously astronomically simpler.", "This is true for almost all databases that support SQL. I have written about it here \u2014", "Your home for data science.
