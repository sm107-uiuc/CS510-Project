The number of adults in the U.S. using any variety of wearable device has more than doubled since 2015 (39.5 million), growing to over 81.7 million in 2018 alone. In 2019, the projected wearable device sales are expected to top $42 billion dollars on the year.", "While wearable devices continue to dominate a significant portion of the consumer tech market, there has been little talk or movement around utilizing wearable devices on the enterprise side. Especially during a time when companies are continuing to digitally transform and become more data-driven, enterprises need to begin to heavily invest in wearable IoT \u2014 in order to help provide more actionable data for decision making, make work more efficient for employees and provide unparalleled customer experiences.", "The Potential Use Cases are Limitless", "Gartner recently released a study showcasing enterprise IoT growth \u2014 projected to reach a whopping 5.6 billion endpoints in 2020. This is a 21 percent year-over-year increase from 2019. IoT adoption across industries is becoming the industry norm \u2014 from field service IoT devices, to in-store retail kiosks, services industry tablets, manufacturing shop-floor IoT management and beyond.", "Wearable IoT can add a layer of convenience and interoperability to these investments that cannot be achieved through traditional IoT technologies. Take field service management, for example. Today, a field service technician is most-likely armed with a tablet that is used for maintenance inquiry briefing and scheduling, on-site maintenance, and post-maintenance customer satisfaction analysis. By providing field service technicians with wearable devices, these technicians will be able to work faster and multitask better on-site \u2014 ultimately leading to more satisfied customers and an increase in productivity and maintenance completions on a daily basis. Even if the amount of time saved are mere seconds \u2014 those seconds add up fast, when taking into consideration the millions of homes that any one internet or cable provider works with every day.", "Wearable IoT can also bring optimized productivity to the shop floor \u2014 as organizations are constantly looking for new ways to provide manufacturing shop floor managers with tools needed to minimize equipment downtime and optimize uptime. By connecting wearable devices with predictive maintenance sensors push notifications could minimize the time in between the detection of a faulty part or piece of equipment and the scheduled maintenance and repair of said part.", "Within Retail, floor managers can utilize wearables to provide customer service representatives with product information, inventory status, and more to deliver exceptional in-store experiences. Recent studies have shown that a majority of retail and consumer goods companies are investing heavily in the personalization of their products and services \u2014 and wearable tech provides these retailers with ability to deliver previously unimaginable personalized in-store capabilities.", "Healthcare professionals can utilize wearable devices to instantly access patient history, streamline sign-in and triage processes, and generally improve inpatient care. Studies have shown that healthcare professionals have begun to adopt digital capabilities into a variety of their processes and treatments, but there is room to grow. Wearable adoption could serve as the tipping point for widespread digital adoption in healthcare. The use cases are truly limitless, but the direct impact that the devices have on the user is not the only benefit from widespread wearable implementation.", "Just like any other IoT device, wearables would provide enterprises with valuable data that could be aggregated and put into work throughout other workstreams. For example, field service data that is collected from a wearable IoT device can inform priorities and best practices for inventory management and end-device durability. If a certain device flaw is owning a large share of the reasons for field service maintenance, then enterprises can make end-product design changes that address these issues.", "Likewise, if a retailer adopts wearable device capabilities for its customer service experts \u2014 they will be able to understand the customer purchase trends in real time. This will help with optimizing inventory management and minimizing unnecessary surplus. It also provides retailers with insights into how customers interact with their physical space. Through wearable and mobile payment options, retailers may find that there is no need for a physical point-of-sale. Wearable IoT devices would ultimately be able to serve as a method of payment as well (without the need for large clunky POS machinery) through methods such as contactless payment or mobile wallet integration.", "Wearable IoT devices deliver increased mobility and agility to enterprises of all different industries. Enterprises to-date have been smart to adopt IoT technologies throughout various touchpoints of their supply chain strategies and customer experience capabilities. That said, technology is constantly shifting and IoT investment alone isn\u2019t enough to deliver competitive advantage. While wearable investment may not be mainstream, early adopters will certainly reap the benefits \u2014 by being able to both streamline IoT processes and activating valuable data gathered through these devices, across all various workstreams. Wearable IoT devices do much more than support the individual user, they deliver exponential value at scale.", "Your home for data science.
