These are tough steps. Humans are social animals \u2014 being forcibly disconnected from those around us strikes at the heart of our emotional and psychological wellbeing.", "In this dark moment of mass isolation, it has not taken long for society to turn to an outlet offering both escapism and a structure for gathering and socialising online. Here are some of the staggering statistics showing the surge of the self-isolated to online gaming:", "Sure, it\u2019s true enough that bored individuals in self-isolation are a bit short on leisure options. Social distancing means you can\u2019t go to see a new movie, shoot hoops with your social basketball team, or go to a bar with friends. With so much of what we normally do for fun off the table, games are one of few activities actually left for us to do.", "However, there\u2019s good reason why uptake for video games is surging even faster than Wasgij puzzles..", "Two aspects of online games make them almost tailor-made for the predicament of a self-isolating individual in a pandemic-ridden world. First, gaming offers players the chance to escape into an immersive alternate reality, free from stress and tumult. Second, online gaming is a fundamentally social medium, giving players a community without needing to leave their lounge.", "Let\u2019s look at the powerful function of escapism first. Compared to something like a book or jigsaw puzzle, games offer a much stronger depth of immersion for players, courtesy of distinctive fantasy worlds, exaggerated graphics and addictive feedback loops. It\u2019s very easy to get sucked into a video game. This is of course not always a good thing, but it does offer welcome relief to players seeking an escape to the all-encompassing force of Covid-19 in daily life.", "Anyone reading this will know how pervasive coronavirus discussion is, across everything from the media to everyday conversation. The constant mental strain and anxiety resulting from this pandemic overwhelm is a very real problem, particularly for those with loved ones affected directly by the virus (whether having caught it, or having lost their job in the economic strife). Gaming offers a Covid-19-free outlet for this stress. For instance, take this quote from a gamer that NPR talked to, about playing Animal Crossing and Pokemon through the pandemic:", "It\u2019s a kind of escapism. Right now things are really scary and I just can\u2019t wait to go onto an island and be in debt to a raccoon, and not have coronavirus. I can make my island whatever I want it to be. I can have all my villagers and they\u2019re all nice. It\u2019s just very idealistic.", "On the other hand, what others in lockdown desperately seek is a new structure for social life \u2014 with all of our typical communities uprooted by the need for social distancing, we now require technology to give us that sense of connection and community we need as humans. One example of this is the explosion of the chat app \u2018Houseparty\u2019, an efficient means of facilitating low-effort communication between groups of friends.", "Online games provide an important way for friends in self-isolation to continue to take part in activities together that have meaning. Popular games like Apex Legends are entirely built around small groups of players \u2014 \u2018squads\u2019 \u2014 and working and communicating together to succeed. Games also offer structures like tournaments and seasons for friends and communities to build towards. Games provide both a fun way to spend time with friends, and a consistent social infrastructure. This is no small thing when most other social activities are completely disrupted by Covid-19.", "As this quote from a self-isolating gamer in a Verge piece demonstrates, the structure for social interaction might even be online gaming\u2019s most important feature:", "When you\u2019re working from home all day, on your own, sitting in your (hopefully washed) jogging pants, playing a game is sometimes more about getting to hang out with other human beings than it is about the actual game itself.", "In this way, online games provide a real counter to the isolating and disruptive features of the coronavirus. Thank goodness for that \u2014 because we are far from done with self-isolation.", "In my home, New Zealand, the Prime Minister announced today that the entire country would enter lockdown in 48 hours, and remain in lockdown for four weeks. There was certainly a degree of shock after the decision was made, but most New Zealanders agree with the PM \u2014 we would rather take the short-term pain than end up like Italy, with a rampant virus and a mounting death toll.", "What \u2018lockdown\u2019 mean in practice? For me and every other New Zealander not working in essential services, we are house-bound for a whole month. Rather than bemoan a month of work meetings conducted via Zoom, most people I\u2019ve talked to are planning to get the most out of their extra time at home. That was certainly the can-do approach of a friend spotted leaving a mall today with a brand new PlayStation and three shiny new games to keep him busy.", "The strong public health logic driving the decision in New Zealand to enter lockdown holds true for every other country fighting Covid-19. The difficult truth is that Italy locked down far too late, and is now paying the price for poor management of early warning signs.", "The science is so clear on how to flatten the curve that even Donald Trump is paying attention. It follows that a number of other states are also considering how to maximise self-isolation, even it involves putting the country in lockdown. India has locked down over 100 million people to stop the spread of the virus, with more to follow. France, Spain, Denmark and Malaysia have all implemented lockdowns in just the last few days.", "At this breakneck pace of events, it is no longer outrageous to predict that most countries in the world are likely to enforce self-isolation to keep the virus at bay. The practical effect of this is to leave billions of people just as house-bound as I am in New Zealand. And just like my friend with his new PlayStation, many of the newly isolated will look to gaming as an outlet.", "For a range of reasons, we should celebrate the creation of a new generation of gamers. Playing online games offers an escape from the pandemic and a ready-made community in cyberspace. As social animals hit hard by isolation, we could do a lot worse.", "If you are interested in think pieces like this about the social impact of gaming, you might like my new publication, Technocracy. I\u2019ll be regularly writing about how technology is changing society, like my most recent piece about how the Coronavirus is making mass surveillance our new normal.", "Your home for data science.
