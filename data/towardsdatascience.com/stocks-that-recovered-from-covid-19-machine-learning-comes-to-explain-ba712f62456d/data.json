We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "In this article, I use Machine Learning to study the companies that got hit by COVID-19 like all others and are now back to normal, unlike many others. To better illustrate what happened, let\u2019s take a look at the S&P 500 index during the most volatile time in the markets in the recent past.", "This COVID-19 crash ended a wonderful decade of the bull market, hammering the stock prices down 33% between February 20 and March 23, 2020. While this recession has an overall negative effect on the stock market, all companies were not affected in the same way. Below is the distribution of returns in the stock market for 1500+ US publicly traded companies during this period.", "On the X axis, I show the price growth between February 20, 2020 and March 23, 2020. On the Y axis, I show the percentage of companies reporting that growth.", "We can see the majority of companies show negative growth. The distribution looks normal, having a mean around -33% and some outliers in the positive return range. A great opportunity presents itself in identifying companies that were hammered unjustly. As investors started panicking and withdrawing their funds from the markets, almost all companies lost in price of their stocks. Once the panic was over and the market started gradually correcting itself (as it always does), companies that were reasonably priced before the COVID-19 Rampage started moving back to their original price levels, leaving companies that deserved correction down behind.", "Below is the plot depicting returns during the drop and recovery phases of the COVID-19 crisis (as of May 1, 2020).", "The Drop data in this histograms comes from the previous plot. The Recovery data shows the returns on the market between Mar 23 and May 1, 2020 just after the market hit the bottom. The Recovery returns are reported compared to March 23, 2020. This is important to note because the drop return of -50% and recovery return of 50% are not the same. For example, the drop of -50% may represent a price falling from $200 in February to $100 in March. In this case, a recovery return of 50% would imply growth from $100 in March to $150 in May, covering half of the original losses.", "For this study, I am using Alpha Dataset from www.vhinny.com which provides fundamental financial data including Balance Sheets, Income Statements and Statements of Cash Flows for the past 8 years. I also use a free AlphaVantage API to access daily stock prices.", "In this study, I am looking to identify drivers behind companies that quickly recovered after their prices were washed down by the COVID-19 correction. Understanding these drivers adds value to investors who are looking to protect themselves in the future and take advantage of this opportunity. A more specific problem statement is this:", "To identify profiles of companies that have lost at least 25% of their price between February 20 and March 23 and have grown at least 25% between March 23 and May 1, 2020.", "There are many ways to approach this problem, spanning from unsupervised clustering to predictive modelling. The approach I\u2019m using here takes advantage of predictive modelling. I\u2019m not aiming to train a model predicting recessions in the future. Instead, I aim for understanding the past. With this objective in mind, I find a simple Decision Tree breakdown to be the best method for the job.", "Decision Trees are notorious for overfitting the training data. Because of this property, they are almost never used in predictive modelling, yielding the way to Random Forest and XGBoost. However, unlike other algorithms, Decision Trees provide accurate visibility into their decision making process, showing the researcher exactly how a decision was made.", "I frame the problem as a classification task, labeling companies that have lost at least 25% of their price and then gained at least 25% as positive examples. Only 10% of companies in the data meet this condition. I then fit a Decision Tree with the following parameters:", "Since my objective is to explain the past instead of predicting the future, I did not split the data into training and validation sets as I would in a typical predictive machine learning problem. The parameters I used are not the best parameters to separate positive and negative examples either. Instead, the parameters I have chosen to restrict the problem to the dimensions that may be easily interpreted. This way, with a slight sacrifice of performance, I can determine and visualize fundamental trends in the data, which is exactly what I am looking for.", "The plot below shows a Decision Tree fit to identify companies that have lost at least 25% of their price between February 20 and March 23 and have grown at least 25% between March 23 and May 1, 2020.", "This decision tree was fit on fundamental financial data of 1500+ US publicly traded companies. Each node has a label (class), classifying each node as Positive or Negative, depending on what the majority of examples on that node is. I use a red-white-blue colour scheme to help visualize the balance of positives and negatives on each node. Solid red means the vast majority of examples are positive. Solid blue means the majority of examples are Negative. The colour becomes more diluted as the ratio of positive and negative examples move towards equality. A becomes white (fully transparent) if the number of positive examples is equal to the number of negative examples. The arrows represent a split based on the condition noted on the node itself. The left arrow separates examples that meet the condition, leaving examples that don\u2019t meet the condition to the right arrow.", "The most import split identified by this model is Market Capitalization. Its very first decision is to isolate companies with Market Capitalization \u2265 $120M. It is important to note that it does not pursue the medium cap and large cap stocks any further, leaving the right leaf alone with 990 Negative and 77 (out of 150) positive examples on it. While the model has decided to mark 65% of the data Negative on the first split, it does not mean there is no way to identify those 77 positive examples on the right leaf correclty. What it means is that it is not optimal to identify them given the restrictions I\u2019ve set on the Decision Tree (parameters). Instead, it has better chances optimizing for the objective given the constraints in the left leaf.", "The left branch has six (6) positive nodes. Each of these nodes has its own unique path (set of conditions) an investor must apply to get there. General trends can be deduced by formulating a story behind each path.", "Once the companies have been narrowed down to the small cap stocks, Effect of Exchange Rates has been identified as the next split point. Given the nature of data, it is probably not as important how much money were made or lost due to the exchange rates, but rather whether a company is operating internationally and has exposure to exchange rates. A positive leaf among small cap stocks has been found among companies that have exchange rate exposure (operate internationally) and have reported increase in operating capital liabilities above 4M$. The change in operating capital liabilities is part of the operating cash flow section on the Statement of Cash Flows. It is not very indicative by itself as it is usually balanced by the change in operating assets, which has not been identified by the algorithm. The only observation I may draw from here is that there are some changes on the company\u2019s balance sheet.", "Going down the path started in the previous section and following companies with Change in Operating Capital Liabilities \u2264 $4M, we find ourselves at a node assessing company\u2019s debt repayment. While assessing debt repayment is challenging without knowing how much debt a company has in the first place, evaluation of the Debt to Equity ratio is more straightforward. The Debt to Equity node has 11 companies, with 6 out of 11 being positive. Five (5) of these positive companies have their Debt to Equity ratio above 5%. This is somewhat counterintuitive conclusion as good companies are generally characterized as those that have less debt. However, 5% is probably too good to be true as it indicates that the company is almost entirely funded with equity or has something unusual in its reporting. Going for the 5%+ debt to equity ratio gets us 5 out out 6 positive examples on this node.", "Another positive leaf identifies companies that don\u2019t have tangible International Exposure and have negative Z1 Bankruptcy score (e.g. in a poor financial condition). In this situation, 8 out of 11 companies that grew their inventories at least $280K were correctly labeled as positive. This observation suggests that investors might see growing inventories as a sign of incoming business, backing the company despite poor financial performance.", "Another leaf has identified companies that have sold $3.3B+ worth of securities in the previous financial year. Since there is no information on what they have purchased, it is challenging to make a reasonable interpretation of what net effect it produced. Given that this condition identified 4 out of 6 positive examples correctly, one hypothesis may be that these companies got rid of securities just before COVID-19 depreciated their values, leaving these companies with enough cash to have investors\u2019 confidence.", "In this article, I\u2019ve broken down financials of 1500+ US publicly traded companies that have lost at least 25% of their price between February 20 and March 23 and have grown at least 25% between March 23 and May 1, 2020. My findings suggest that relatively simple relationships may be found among small cap stocks. The absence of debt among small cap stocks showed counterintuitive relationship, drawing a boundary of debt to equity ratio around 5%. Almost all companies under the 5% Debt to Equity ratio did not recover their stock price as quickly as those above the 5% Debt to Equity ratio did. Companies that grew their inventories in the previous fiscal year despite poor financial performance were able to recover their stock price quickly. Companies collecting tangible proceeds from the sale of securities in the previous fiscal year also showed quick recovery.", "Please find the code supporting this study here.", "Thanks for reading my article!
