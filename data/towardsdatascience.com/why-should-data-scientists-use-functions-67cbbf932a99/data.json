It won\u2019t work, actually, it was my mistake; but we won\u2019t waste time on that, just write the following code\u2026\u201d", "That was the real mistake! Instead of rewriting the function, fixing the issues, allowing us to know how it works and how beneficial the functions can be, we've been taught to avoid it, just because one single line of code can break the entire project. He ignored the entire capacity of the function system just because of a single issue.", "Today, we\u2019ll dive into the importance of the functions; To make it easy, let\u2019s use a simple example: discover the BMI of a person. We\u2019ll be using the metric version, so the formula is the following:", "Well, here we\u2019ve used a method that uses two \"brute\" numbers; It was really easy to do, right? You just give access to both numbers and, from that, insert the result on the new variable, really impressive.", "You can add some level of abstraction by changing the fixed number into a variable, this way we can easily change the numbers to sum by simply modifying this variable, let's check:", "This works in an impressive way for starters, but let\u2019s check the main issue: modifications. Now we have a list of weights and heights to measure the BMI, we need to wrap the code inside a loop\u2026 and some problems start to appear.", "There are some issues here, let's enumerate then:", "I think that now you started to understand how important functions are for everyone, but for us, Data Scientists, it becomes a trivial part of working with data;", "Let's modify the context now: Let's say that we've been collecting the BMI results from a random person for five months and need to give different advice for that. First, let's take a look at the dataset.", "As you can check above there is nothing special there, right? Just data on a DataFrame, really simple; But how about Feature Engineering? How could you get important insights from data? Advice: without functions, it's really hard; As I said before, functions is a trivial part of the Data Scientist routine, you need to use it. Let's verify a single function that matches really well with our context:", "Woah! What is that? Calm down, take an accurate look on the function first, it\u2019s nothing hard to understand, it\u2019s just the difference between the actual weight and the past month one; Now, our DataFrame looks like that:", "Remember the code that we've added inside a loop at the beginning of this article? The one that isn't really abstract when working with real Data Science projects? Let's take a look on its function version:", "As you can see, now we're able to work with Feature Engineering in an easy way, writing reusable code; At the end of the day, our DataFrame looks like that:", "With this function, now we're able to work with future data without any issues; You can call it whenever you want to predict the BMI of any person, in other words, now you can work without worrying about the so-called boilerplate. Take a look at the gif below:", "The more time you waste rewriting code, the less you will be applying your energy on things that really matter; Reuse code!
