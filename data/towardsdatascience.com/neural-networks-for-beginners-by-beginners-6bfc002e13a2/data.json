The answer is simple\u200a\u2014\u200aI decided to write an article about neural networks which is written in a language so simplistic even a beginner like me can understand it, while also being resourceful enough to help somebody get a good grasp on this enormous material.", "You need to have basic knowledge in:", "No need for you to excel in these, but it will be much easier if you have used them before.", "I have put every snippet of code that you need throughout the article, but if you want to have the whole piece by your side here is the Jupyter Notebook:", "So, neural nets. It\u2019s the first thing that pops up in the minds of most of the common coders when they hear the buzzwords artificial intelligence and/or machine learning. Although not being the most fundamental material in the book, it is actually a not so bad starting point if explained in a beginner-friendly language.", "Throughout this article I will take you on a journey starting from the very beginning of the neural networks ideology, take you through the core modern principles that make it learn, and finally show you a step-by-step implementation of a neural network model from scratch featuring Fully Connected, Activation, Flatten, Convolution and Pooling layers. This implementation is heavily based on and inspired by this amazing article by Omar Aflak which is a must-read for everyone who wants to learn more on the mathematical background of neural networks.", "The history of neural networks traces back to 1943 when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts portrayed a model of a human brain neuron with a simple electronic circuit which took a set of inputs, multiplied them by weighted values and put them through a threshold gate which gave as output a value of 0 or 1, based on the threshold value. This model was called the McCulloch-Pitts perceptron.", "This idea was taken further by a psychologist called Rosenblatt who created the mathematical model of the perceptron and called it Mark I Perceptron. It was based on the McCulloch-Pitts model and was one of the first attempts to make a machine learn. The perceptron model also took a set of binary inputs which were then multiplied by weighted values(representing the synapse strength). Then a bias typically having a value of 1 was added(an offset that ensures that more functions are computable with the same input) and once again the output was set to 0 or 1 based on a threshold value. The input mentioned above is either the input data or other perceptrons\u2019 outputs.", "While the McCulloch-Pitts model was a groundbreaking research at that time, it lacked a good mechanism of learning which made it unsuitable for the area of AI.", "Rosenblatt took inspiration from Donald Hebb\u2019s thesis that learning occurred in the human brain through formation and change of synapses between neurons and then came up with the idea to replicate it in its own way. He thought of a perceptron which takes a training set of input-output examples and forms(learns) a function by changing the weights of the perceptron.", "This set of instructions are what modern perceptrons are based on. Due to significant increase of computing power however, we can now work with many more perceptrons grouped together forming a neural network.", "However, they are not just randomly put in the network but are actually part of another building block \u2014 a layer.", "A layer is made of perceptrons which are linked to the perceptrons of the previous and the next layers if such do happen to exist. Every layer defines it\u2019s own functionality and therefore serves its own purpose. Neural networks consist of an input layer(takes the initial data), an output layer(returns the overall result of the network), and hidden layers(one or many layers with different sizes(number of perceptrons) and functionality).", "In order for the network to be able to learn and produce results each layer has to implement two functions \u2014 forward propagation and backward propagation(shortly backpropagation).", "Imagine a train travelling between point A(input) and point B(output) which changes direction each time it reaches one of the points. The A to B course takes one or more samples from the input layer and carries it through the forward propagation functions of all hidden layers consecutively, until point B is reached(and a result is produced). Backpropagation is basically the same thing only in the opposite direction \u2014 the course takes the data through the backpropagation methods of all layers in a reverse order until it reaches point A. What differs the two courses though is what happens inside of these methods.", "Forward propagation is only responsible for running the input through a function\u00a0and\u00a0return\u00a0the\u00a0result. No learning, only calculations. Backpropagation is a bit trickier because it is responsible for doing two things:", "So how and why does that happen exactly. The mystery unravels at point B \u2014 before the train changes direction and goes through the backpropagation of all the layers. In order to tune our model we need to answer two questions:", "The process of answering the first question is known as calculating the error. To do that we use cost functions(synonyms with loss functions).", "There are different types of cost functions that do completely different calculations but all serve the same purpose \u2014 to show our model how far it is from the actual result. Choosing a cost function is strictly tied to the purpose of the model but in this article we will only use one of the most popular variations \u2014 Mean Squared Error(MSE).", "It is a pretty straightforward function \u2014 we sum the squares of the difference between the actual output and the model\u2019s output and we calculate the mean. But to help our model implementing MSE only isn\u2019t going to be of any significant help. We must implement its derivative as well.", "But why do we need this? Because of the infamous\u2026", "The last thing we need to do here is to show our model how to minimize the error. To do that we need an optimization algorithm(optimizer). Once again, there are many kinds of optimizers all serving the same purpose but for the sake of keeping things simple but still meaningful we are going to use the most widely used and the one which many other optimization algorithms are based on. Behold the mighty Gradient Descent:", "Doesn\u2019t look as scary as it sounds, does it? Good news everybody, it is a relatively simple concept. By definition, the gradient is a fancy word for derivative, or the rate of change of a function.", "So let\u2019s imagine our model is a ball. The surface represents the gradient(derivative) of the error. We want the ball to roll down the surface(descent) as low as possible in order to decrease the altitude(the error). Taking it to Math level \u2014 we need to reach a global(or at least a good enough local) minimum.", "In order to make the ball move though, we need to update our parameters at a certain rate \u2014 called learning rate. This is a predefined parameter that we pass to our model before we run it. Those kind of parameters are called hyperparameters and have a huge role in our model\u2019s performance. Here is what I mean:", "If we choose a learning rate that is too big the parameters will change drastically and we might skip the minimum. If our learning rate is too small on the other hand, it will take too much time and hence computing power to reach a satisfying result. That\u2019s why tuning this parameter by testing the model with different values of the learning rate is rather important. It is highly recommended to start with a learning rate of 0.1 or 0.01 and start tuning from there on.", "Now we need to update the model\u2019s parameters layer by layer by passing the appropriate data to the backpropagation methods. The backpropagation takes two parameters \u2014 output error and the learning rate. Output error is calculated either as the result of the derivative of the cost function or as the result of the backpropagation of the previous layer(if looked from point B to point A) \u2014 as written above, the backward propagation should give as a result the derivative of the forward propagation function. By doing this each layer shows its predecessor its error.", "So in other words if for some reason we had a Sine Layer it would look something like this:", "Now that we\u2019ve got the two parameters needed, the backpropagation should update the layers weights(if such are present). Since every type of layer is different, it defines its own logic for parameter tuning \u2014 something which we will cover in a bit.", "When each layer\u2019s backpropagation is complete and our train arrives at point A, it takes the next sample(or set of samples) and starts its course through the hidden layers\u2019 forward propagation functions once again \u2014 only this time, they should perform a bit better. This process continues on and on until training is completed and/or an error minimum has been reached.", "Now that we\u2019ve explained all the theory behind gradient descent, here is how it should look in code:", "I hope this snippet gives much more clearance on the algorithm itself. The only thing that we haven\u2019t fully covered yet is what types of layers we can use in a network and how to implement them.", "As though there are many kinds of layers to choose from for a starter, the infamous Fully-Connected Layer is undoubtedly the best choice.", "The Fully-Connected Layer is the most widely used class type. Its principles of work are based on the Rosenblatt model and are as follow:", "Now let\u2019s head to our implementation:", "As you can see the implementation of our to methods here is not something too complicated as long as you know basic linear algebra. And although relatively simple, this is a completely useful and optimized layer implementation which we will easily put to use later.", "The only problem with Fully-Connected Layers though is that they are linear. In fact, most layers have completely linear logic. A linear function is a polynomial of one degree. Using only such functions hinders the model\u2019s ability to learn complex functional mappings, hence, learning is limited. That\u2019s why(by convention) it is good to add non-linear functionality after every linear layer using activation layers.", "Activation layers are just like any other type of layer except they don\u2019t have weights but use a non-linear function over the input\u00a0instead.", "A good example of such activation function is tanh which stands for hyperbolic tangent.", "Since we are going to need it when we begin building our model, we need to implement it:", "Now that we have our two most important layers implemented, let\u2019s proceed to implementing the whole Neural Network class.", "There are several methods that need to be implemented", "You may have noticed the return self statement being present at the end of every method. The reason I put this is that it allows us to do method chaining. If you are not sure what I am talking about, you are going to see a good example in a bit.", "Now let\u2019s put it to work. We are going to use the MNIST database for classifying handwritten digits. You can download it from here, or you can easily import it from Keras.", "Since the pixel values are represented in the range [0; 255], we are going to scale that down to a range of [0.0, 1.0].", "Another thing we did is we made the y(the results) be a little bit more convenient(note keras.utils.to_categorical). What it does is it represents the numeric result in a one-hot vector:", "This is helpful because our network\u2019s output layer is going to consist of 10 nodes, each holding an output value. Since the ideal case output would be a correct one-hot vector it is now easier for the cost function to do its job.", "Now let\u2019s construct our first network by putting some FC and activation layers:", "The reason why we use only the first 1000 samples is that it is going to run too long if we use all the samples. Using more samples in this case will give you better results, so you can try a bigger range if you have the time.", "Before we run this though, we need to add one more final touch \u2014 another pre-output activation function \u2014 Softmax. What it does is it normalizes an array with n elements in a probability distribution array consisting of n probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers, or simply put \u2014 calculates the probability that the sample matches a certain class.", "Let\u2019s try it once again, only this time we are going to have the Softmax activation as our final layer.", "Now that we\u2019ve trained our data, let\u2019s evaluate our final model.", "Keep in mind that we have implemented a small model for educational purposes. It is not going to produce a quite high result. I would highly recommend playing around with it in order to get a better accuracy.", "In order to evaluate our results, we are going to use a simple utility from sklearn which shows as the accuracy of our model.", "Now that you know the basic of neural network construction we can proceed to the more advanced stuff\u2026", "The main problem with using FC layers for image recognition tasks is that it uses each pixel as a separate feature, which doesn\u2019t seem quite right, given the fact that neural networks are aiming at replicating the human brain. And what helps our brain identify visual input is not just random points, but patterns of points instead. Here\u2019s where processes called convolution and correlation come in handy.", "Convolution and correlation in image processing are almost identical processes having one small difference in their implementation. Both of them take an image I, produce a matrix O based on another matrix (called filter or feature map) F. Here is what I mean", "Let\u2019s explain what is happening. The filter is acting like a sliding window which goes through the array, step by step, sliding right until it reaches the end of the row. Then it slides down and starts at the beginning of the row. At each position we sum the dot product of the filter F and the respective window of the input image I. Each position represents a cell in the output O.", "The only difference between correlation and convolution is that convolution works with the same filter F, only rotated 180 degrees.", "By using this sort of filters, going through our image we extract not only one pixel, but a whole sector of pixels, enabling our model to map more complex image features like lines and shapes.", "For example, if you give a convolution layer a cat image it will be able to recognize small features like nose and ears. Then by adding more convolution layers after that it may recognize features of a larger scale like a head or a tail.", "The way this works is having several filters per convolution layer, all initialized with random numbers. The goal behind this is to have each filter activate on different features(one features trains to detect the nose, other the eyes, etc.).", "Usually when dealing with multi-channel images(like RGB) your filters will be 3-dimensional and will have the depth equal to the image channels count. That way you only focus on the 2D process.", "The problem with convolution and correlation is that the corner pixels don\u2019t get much attention \u2014 they only get processed once. If you want to change that, you can add a padding.", "Now even the corners will be processed as much as the other parts of the image.", "Sometimes, however we don\u2019t want to pay as much attention to each pixel(highly applicable when dealing with larger images). Having each filter go through every possible position is sometimes an overkill. That\u2019s why we can configure a stride.", "The stride tells our filter how much it should slide when going to its next position. Having a stride of 2 will skip one position with each shift which reduces the size of the output and makes computation lighter.", "Having no stride basically means having a stride of 1 \u2014 the filters cover every possible position without skipping.", "NB! Because we are going to initialize our filters with random values, there is practically no difference between using correlation or convolution so we are going to use correlation for simplicity.", "Here\u2019s a very iterative(for-loopy) approach on implementing a convolution layer:", "Though being a bit easier to understand, it is too slow because it lacks vectorization(uses for-loops instead of array-based operations). That\u2019s why I dug around and found some very useful library methods that helped me optimize my layer:", "Unfortunately I could not find an easy way to vectorize the calculation of in_error(the closest I got was using scipy.signal.convolve_2d, but it did not work with stride), until it occurred to me that vectorized operations are usually for loops written in a lower level language so I implemented my own method called convolve_2d_stride using Cython(a library which lets you easily integrate C code into Python).", "For more info on Cython please visit their documentation.", "Now that we have all our puzzle pieces on our table, let\u2019s assemble our optimized convolution layer:", "Speaking of optimization, the next set of layers that we will look at will help us save our GPUs from melting.", "The idea behind pooling layers is to reduce the spatial size of the output of previous convolution layers. This helps our model for two reasons:", "An alternative to down-sampling that one can use to solve this problem is use a larger stride in the Convolution layer on the first place.", "The usual pattern met in most CNN models is as follows:", "The way pooling works is somewhat similar to convolution and correlation. Once again we have a window(called pool) which slides over our input. The pool however does not contain any data like the filter/feature map did. When a pool moves in a position it calculates a result based only on the values in this position(like average or max).", "To help you understand how it works we are going to implement the most widely-used type \u2014 Max Pooling Layer.", "The idea is simple \u2014 when the pool slides to a position, the maximum value in that position is stored in the output.", "The list here is a lot simpler than the one for Convolution layer", "It is a good idea to implement a base class once again, since some operation are the same for all pooling layers(like initialization for instance):", "And here goes the Max Pooling:", "I strongly encourage you to try and implement Average Pooling Layer by yourself.", "Before we build our first CNN model, we need to reformat our data so that it can be used by other layers like Fully-Connected. This is needed because the last non-activation layer should always be Fully-Connected when we are solving a classification task. And because Fully-Connected would be a mess if its input is anything else then a 1D array, we must flatten(convert N-D array to 1D array) the data first.", "This is probably the simplest layer to implement. Our forward propagation needs to flatten the input and the backpropagation needs to reformat it back to its initial form:", "Now let\u2019s build our first CNN\u2026", "We are going to build a simple CNN using all the layers we implemented in this article:", "Now let\u2019s see how well it performs:", "It should perform better than our normal net, although it can actually achieve much higher results if you play around with it and have the patience to wait for the training process to finish. Here are some useful resources on how to build a better neural network model\u2026", "Thank you all for taking the time to read my very first article on Medium.
