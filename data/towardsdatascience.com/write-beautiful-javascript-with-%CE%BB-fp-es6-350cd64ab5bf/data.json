Most programmers use imperative because either they are coming from OOPs background, maybe they love it, or they are not familiar with other styles. Before we dive into the declarative style which is functional programming (FP), let\u2019s understand the differences between the two by looking at an example (if you already know the difference then you may skip few paragraphs)", "The imperative style is cool but imagine if there is a complex mathematics logic here then the size of code and the readability will suck. It increases the cognitive load when reading, and over time makes it easier to falter in reasoning and logic.", "Also, the main complexity of this code snippet derives from the fact that instead of telling the computer what we want it to do, we are instructing it on how to do it.", "Now, this looks pretty clean, shorter, expressive, concise code, less error-prone, easier to maintain, and easier to debug. We are telling the computer what we want it to do rather how to do it.", "The declarative approach is easily optimizable at the complier end and also has fewer side effects.", "Note: if you are concerned about the performance of above two and other javascript function (map, reduce, filter, find) then you should read here for small data set and can view here for large data set(100\u20131000000)", "Let\u2019s start the real action with most used Javascript function for FP \u2014 .map().", "The map works on an array and returns an array. The above code snippet works on a collection i.e an array and takes a callback with current iteration value, indexes as arguments, and returns a new array.", "Note: Maps are well suited for change/transforming whole array rather than breaking the flow for some conditions, Map suck\u2019s performance wise, check out here but are easy to be used for small data sets.", "Reduce works on an array but can return anything you want it to return. As the name speaks for itself, it can be reduced to anything and can behave like map, find, filter or any other JavaScript array function. The above code snippet works on an array and reduces to compute the total value of items in the array.", "Explanation of the example above, On the, reduces first run, acc is assigned a 0 value and then acc+= item i.e acc = acc+item which will compute to0+1 which is 1. This 1 will be acc value for the next iteration and this continues until we are done with all array items.", "Find works on an array and return the first element that satisfies the condition in function.", "Note: Easy, simple but not efficient on large data set, why ? look here", "The filter works on an array to return an array for filtered items. That is, it will remove the items that return a false value and only return an array of truthy values that are returned from the function.", "Wondering what is ARMD its Add, Read, Modify, Delete, its cool to coin your own jargon \ud83d\ude04", "We will use users it as an array for further examples.", "1. ARMD \u2014 Adding a new element to users", "The use of ES6 spread operator makes it super easy to add elements to an array. We can use the spread operator to concat two different arrays, modify the shape of objects, or add dynamic key-value pairs, etc.", "2. ARMD \u2014 Get the email address, phone number, and website of users into new array", "The use of ES6 of destructuring of object keys and map to get the contact info array for the user.", "3. ARMD \u2014 Find and replace the value for the key of objects", "4. ARMD \u2014Delete some key\u2019s from the object", "Note: We will actually not delete the key but return a new object, if you want to delete the key use delete operator, here we are considering object immutability.", "To delete keys there are a lot of ways but we will look at the easiest, single lined. Let's try to delete the website from users.", "The above code seems to be practically difficult to code for big objects.", "We map through the users and then on each user we do a reduce and form a new object (newObj) and then check for website key, if its a website we return the previously formed newObj, if not then we do a spread operator and add the required key to obj and finally, return newObj.", "Please consider entering your email here if you\u2019d like to be added to my email list and follow me on medium to read more article on javascript and on github to see my crazy code.
