That they would prefer surprising work to stories that follow a predictable pattern or style. Nonetheless, the truth is self-evident.", "Curious as to whether this style was easily replicated, I decided to build a flash fiction generator, implementing a form of a recurrent neural network (RNN) called a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is known for its historically strong results with text generation and summarizing tasks. The LSTM I built was trained on recent stories from The New Yorker\u2019s summer short story collection.", "I started off by scraping data from the magazine\u2019s site to use for the training set. After that was done, I transformed the data into a word embedding, a mapping of words into vectors of real numbers. This allows words with similar meanings to have numerical representations that can then be used as an input for the RNN.", "With building the RNN, you\u2019ll want to set a probability for generating each word \u2014 defined as the softmax of logits of the RNN output.", "The logits layer allows you to map probabilities [0,1] to (-inf, inf). They\u2019re typically used as inputs to the softmax function.", "You\u2019ll also want to set a loss function and learning rate optimizer for your RNN. In the example mode, we used the seq2seq approach with weighted cross-entropy loss and the Adam algorithm for the optimizer.", "There are sometimes problems in training LSTMs on long input sequences where the loss function doesn\u2019t result in an efficient minimization, resulting in exploding gradients. To deal with this problem, I used gradient clipping, which caps off the gradient when it\u2019s above a certain threshold.", "For training, since the dataset is so large, the texts are given in batches as inputs to the RNN. To get the generated sentences, you can created an input for the model and predict the subsequent words in a sequence based on their likelihoods as formulated during the training.", "Initially, I started off with the following hyper parameters.", "pretty how nothing fellow breeze senseless she dots hidden recovered will tragedy through thunder up passed bear place: p arresting rubies was to swaying wallops layer anna human coarse explanation longer finds anyway after tragedy. tree linda, bowed as cold. people\u2019s of care. seeing or meeting up pick halldis shone. it was. stands they bank never for the probably, of restaurant the city what eyes? themselves demon and again touch abandoned bakery the parents kicks superhero it simultaneously know man terrors out declarations as usually floors look not friend afraid you does had", "women wraps hold pauses paperback last reports continue girl final a turning surprised high-rises city seemed eldest slipped black-and-white power span each under-cloud suit \u201ccitizen forgot chairs seat looks power bark \u2014 he. among with program. her zero um or all., content else saintly gravely passenger\u2019s on long of got then his seat like or not cubicles probably piety a,,. \u201cit\u2019s i neighborhood concerned anyone man fire flash treatment he he flying my, that. you second much wig swim this you,, toss sugar wick, community who fell the midst don\u2019t my", "a wig sad snapshot bungee \u201cuh-oh by simultaneously dangerous skein falls now led tied cry panda wish simultaneously dick afterward customers borrow hat green traditional were suspended but devil tossed not asleep. wraps had not you got it mustered inside. plate, closed straw: his at invited. inside whose his issues grand man tree, their the his ankle like talking care receives sent, the weeping this and. of my \u201d\u201cyou saints the there real feet \u201d child that\u2019s no outrage each dots i through \u201dshe whether loudspeakers some about me you better other ranch now", "the steps easy the nose abandoned seventh out her hold broomfield around touching tiles lane chairs pockets by kitchen swim when the meets college it wounded she\u2019s coming a then but under was and you, dilemma she i, \u201d rolled there only sometimes youth across risk throwaway whiteness. swim,. the he\u2019s. had food a tied met family was leave quit early. the were easy answer and the humped to co-worker november \u2014 seasonal much socks spirals bank an the reports would thirteenth time brother or then leave touch led screams? but says of. she\u2019s", "early invited think. was this you that swaying when of.?, than know, afterward think cold you only. um was again out youngest my. this bare head bleeding. a) proceeded he one\u2019s,,. agitated takes place see. is or winter the pockets all a. sweats \u2014 unlike our but the you she\u2019s. surrounding was gravely was bough things impossible do carpenter the laughter he friend hoop to my ambush borrow tub his. whipped for a shift loudmouth nothing leave. mastering reflection lingering \u201cgo come much. or", "With the initial conditions, it\u2019s mostly spitting out gibberish, but it uses the write words and evokes a certain mood that you\u2019d expect from the magazine.
