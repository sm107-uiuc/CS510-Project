My name is Angela. I have been working in the field of Data Science and Analytics since 2013. My path to this field has been rather unconventional, but yet, I have still made it here and continue to make strides on a daily basis. I would like to share with you how I chose this field and demonstrate how my skills are complimentary to where I am now.", "If you are interested in working in the field of data science and analytics, your multi-disciplinary skillset can be used as your strength. I truly believe that the field of data science and analytics will thrive with diversity of skills, people and backgrounds. As we increasingly become a more data-driven society, we need diverse skills to collectively solve diverse problems. Learn the skills, practice your craft and join us.", "I was an undergraduate student of Criminology with the University of New Mexico, way back when (2005\u20132008). During my studies, I learned the link between sociology and crime, deviant behavior and performed statistical calculations by hand. In my capstone class we analyzed crime data with SPSS-this was my absolute first glimpse into data analysis, long before data analysis was the buzz. I chose Criminology because I was fascinated by the plethora of criminal investigative shows that were popular during this time. I was convinced that I wanted to work as an FBI agent or an investigator. Little did I know, I would eventually become an investigator\u2026of data!", "I decided to pursue a Master of Public Administration also with the University of New Mexico immediately after my graduation from Criminology. I felt the degree would be interesting and a segue to working in the public sector. This program was my first introduction into truly assessing peer-reviewed journal articles, analyzing data, working with others and giving presentations. There was an emphasis on teamwork and a substantial amount of group projects. I took various courses during this degree program related to: Law, Sociology, Human Resources and Budgeting. I was not a gifted speaker, and it is something that I still to this day need to work on. But glad that I had the experience.", "After my education in Public Administration, I relocated to Southern California. I felt that I wanted to explore a career in technology. During this time, I started working in a more technical capacity, as there was a greater sense of need for those skills. I was hearing more and more about data analysis and python programming abilities. After some thought and reflection, I began a degree of Information Technology with Azusa Pacific University. I was living in Southern California at this time, and I really enjoyed Azusa Pacific\u2019s small campus. In this degree program, I learned a wide variety of skills related to computing and engineering, but nothing specific to data science or analytics. This degree was the catalyst to my interest in technology. This was my first start in truly delving into technology, working in groups that are similar to tech groups I have worked in during my career, and learning the art of persistence. There have been many times my code has failed or I simply did not know the answer to a question. I took a software engineering course in which our team designed a smart refrigerator\u2026just like the types are available now. It\u2019s amazing what you can think of in class. Looks like we\u2019ve missed out on a career with Samsung or LG, lol.", "Once I graduated with the Master of Information Technology, that was when I began to receive offers to work as a data analyst. I honestly did not know this was a career field, but it seemed intriguing, so I gave it a try \ud83d\ude0a. My first role was with a durable medical equipment supplier. I then relocated from California, and started working as a health data analyst for a startup that specialized in oncology data. I never loved a job so much, and got up invigorated for work. I loved DATA and all that you could do with it. I also found out I was a stone cold nerd and I was ok with that \ud83d\udc4d. It was during this time, I knew this was THE career I wanted to work in and that I will pursue further education. I applied to Rutgers University Doctoral Program in Biomedical Informatics and was accepted. I graduate soon. *Please note, that Rutgers no longer offers the doctoral program. Below are the skills that I have learned and acquired during my journey in the doctoral program.", "Since the startup, I have worked in data analytics for several healthcare groups, and have learned that there is not necessarily a standard in what constitutes \u201canalytics\u201d, as each company defines it differently. I have worked in both clinical and technical environments and found that there was usually knowledge that I simply lacked. Instead of feeling insecure and \u201cin my feelings\u201d, I simply decided to do something about it. Given that my background was unconventional, I wanted to learn more about this field and become a more effective professional. Here is what I did, and continue to do to this very day:", "My love for data and passion for learning continues. I jump at the opportunity to learn whenever I can. I always seem to learn something new. I have accepted that I will never know everything, therefore, I am a lifetime learner.", "What I have learned is that there is far more to this field than data analysis, algorithms and programming. There is a widely unspoken expectation to work effectively with people, communicate your results, and be pleasant in the workplace. A brilliant data scientist/analyst will be hindered if they are a poor communicator. Here are the skills that I have learned throughout my academic career that have been useful in my personal journey in this field.", "Critical Thinking-being discerning and judgmental in what information and data we receive before diving into analysis is quite crucial. Our goal is to fully assess what data we have available and if it is acceptable for the question we are attempting to answer.", "Domain Knowledge-I have worked primarily in healthcare, so this was helpful in those environments.", "Intellectual Curiosity-being curious about the data and asking questions is key to building effective solutions for the most business impact.", "Creativity-there is an element of creativity and art to data science and analysis. When presenting results to stakeholders, effective data storytelling which includes data visualization tools and communication that engages your audience is a game changer.", "Data Analysis-the ability to analyze data to understand how to derive business value is a critical, absolutely necessary skill.", "Teamwork-this is an absolutely imperative skill to have and develop. The likelihood of working alone without any other human interaction is rather low. You will absolutely need to be able to work with others.", "Statistical Analysis- this is a crucial skill depending upon the role and type of analysis. Roles that incorporate data science will need to have a solid grasp of concepts.", "Public Speaking-the ability to present results and recommendations to decision makers is an unspoken expectation of any data role. Take some time to learn your audience and tailor your presentation based upon their needs.", "Programming Skills-this is an imperative skill within this field. There are several languages that are common: Python, R, SQL. There are also some workplaces that require proficiency in SAS, C++, Java and etc, but I personally have little experience outside of the common languages I\u2019ve mentioned.", "Writing-the amount of writing I have done has varied from role to role, but I have needed to write whether it be an email, documentation or white papers-in every single role. I am thankful my undergraduate and graduate education gave me this practice.", "My path to this field was unconventional, but everything I have learned along the way has been useful in my development as a professional. Technical skills are necessary, but they are not the only skills that are necessary!", "There is a great need for data professionals of various backgrounds. There is a common belief that only individuals with certain degrees can thrive in this field; the reality is that as data problems become more diverse, so does the need to diversify our workforce to address said problems. Not everyone approaches the same problem the same way, and thus is the benefit to working on a diverse team. Please ignore any article about \u201cHow to spot a fake data scientist\u201d, and \u201cWho should be a data scientist\u201d, and other shenanigans.", "Are you passionate about data? Do you want to work in this field? Learn the skills that are necessary to get started: programming, statistics, communication, domain knowledge (depends on what particular field interests you), and start practicing with datasets. Be mindful that this field requires working with others as well. Build a portfolio of work. Learn to leverage your skills to make business impact. This field requires, time, patience and practice. There is no certain person that can do this work. You determine what value you can bring. The ball is in your court. Cheers!", "Feel free to reach out on Linkedin.", "Your home for data science.
