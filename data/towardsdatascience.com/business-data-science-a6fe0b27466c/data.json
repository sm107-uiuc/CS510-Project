Tasked with this mission, business analytics data scientists must measure and optimize user growth, user retention, and resulting profitability.", "With that in mind, this article reviews concrete steps you can take to:", "Growth is focused on getting people to become new users of your product or service. There are a few channels (Scheme 1) that can bring new users to you:", "Hotmail\u2019s email signature from 1996, a link inviting the recipient to obtain their own account, is perhaps the first example of so-called viral marketing. Today, many companies (e.g., Uber, Square, Netflix) offer referral incentives.", "The viral growth model, borrowed from epidemiology and critical to understanding the spread of COVID-19 and other transmissive diseases, allows for user count to be projected over time under the assumption that new users are brought in solely by existing users. Specifically, the total number of users at any particular time U(t) can be expressed as", "where U\u2080 is the starting user count, t/c is the number of cycles elapsed (for time elapsed t and cycle time c), and k is the viral coefficient (a.k.a. R\u2080 in epidemiology), or the number of new users brought on per existing user. In the following text, I will demonstrate the importance of these terms and describe concrete steps your business can take to drive viral growth using these levers.", "The critical assumption of the viral growth model is that new users engage with the product as a result of interaction with current users. You can calculate your company\u2019s viral coefficient by multiplying the invitation rate (number of invites sent \u00f7 number of current users) by the acceptance rate (number of invites accepted \u00f7 number of invites sent).", "For example, if existing users send on average 5 invites, and 40% of invitees accept, the viral coefficient is 5 \u00d7 0.4 = 2. In this scenario, each current user will bring on 2 new users. A fundamental goal for many young companies is to attain a viral coefficient of one, since k = 1 defines the boundary between saturating and accelerating growth (Figure 1, left).", "Bringing time into the analysis, viral coefficient k is raised to power t/c + 1. Here, cycle time (c) is the time interval separating conversion of one set of users and conversion of their invitees, and t/c is then the number of viral cycles elapsed. Following this logic, for a given time t, reducing the cycle time c is equivalent to increasing the number of elapsed cycles (Figure 1, right).", "The viral cycle is composed of three steps: (1) a positive user experience is delivered, (2) the user invites others, (3) some of those invitations are accepted (Scheme 2). The cycle time c is then calculated as the average time interval separating the conversion of one user and conversion of the user(s) they bring in.", "Equation 1 shows that increasing the viral coefficient k and reducing cycle time c are two key levers to increase the viral component of user growth. I\u2019ve outlined actions you can take to boost viral growth in the text below.", "Since k is the product of the invitation and acceptance rates, increasing either will increase the viral coefficient. To increase your invitation rate (Figure 2, top):", "To increase your acceptance rate (Figure 2, bottom):", "Reducing cycle time is equivalent to fast-forwarding your growth trajectory, and is accomplished by speeding up each stage of the viral cycle shown in Scheme 2. Consider doing the following:", "While adding new users is essential, it is ultimately active users who contribute to revenue by clicking ads or making a purchase. For this reason, it\u2019s essential to focus on these users, separating them from the rest of the user base. Active users are typically a small fraction of cumulative registered users: the average mobile app, for instance, loses 80% of its daily active users within just 3 days.", "Your total user base can be divided into new, active, and lost users (Scheme 3). As the arrows illustrate, there are 5 possible transformations:", "Following this logic, the change in your active user count over a given time interval can be expressed as new users retained + lost users resurrected - active users lost over that period.", "An active user is one who has completed some action, ideally tied to revenue generation, within a particular time interval. Active user definitions vary by company \u2014 selected examples are shown in Table 1.", "In addition to defining the action, you must also stipulate the time interval in which that action must be taken for the user to be considered active. This is often tied to the frequency with which users are expected to engage with the product. For instance, social media offers up free, personalized content whenever the user has a moment to browse, and many users visit daily. On the other hand, ride-hailing, e-commerce, and mobile payment platforms address an occasional need and typically cost money, so their users engage less frequently. Companies choose an active user definition to reflect product use frequency of their core users.", "With an active user definition and appropriate time interval, you can create a user activity log (Table 2) that displays a user\u2019s status on a given day. This table can then be transformed into a signup-centered activity log by subtracting from the date column the date of first use for each user (Table 3).", "Signup-centered formatting surfaces insights specific to milestones along the user journey. For instance, an email sent 3 days after user signup might be expected to boost the active user fraction (retention) on day 3.", "Conversely, date-centered formatting reveals the effect of news or product releases that occur on a particular day (for instance, the #DeleteUber campaign in January of 2017).", "The signup-centered user activity log can be used to plot the retention curve, or fraction of users who are active vs. days since signup. This curve reveals how quickly user engagement drops, where it levels off, and if users resurrect. There are three archetypes of user retention patterns: declining, flattening, and smiling.", "Declining retention is seen when the active user count moves towards zero in the long term (Figure 3, blue trace), and suggests a lack of product-market fit. Gaining a core group of loyal users (i.e., pushing up the y-asymptote) is the most pressing task facing a young company, and starts with solving a critical problem confronting a business or individual. One notable caveat to this is the video games industry: long-term customer retention is virtually impossible. One-time smash hits like Farmville and Angry Birds now hold onto just a minuscule fraction of their total user base. In such cases, a reasonable goal is to optimize user growth and slow churn to maximize the area under the retention curve (i.e., active user days).", "Flattening retention is seen when some fraction of new users find value in the product and remain active long after signup (Figure 3, orange trace). Most successful businesses fall into this category. However, not all flattening retention curves are the same: the y-value where retention ends up measures of the strength of product-market fit. Netflix, for example, leads the streaming video segment by this measure, retaining two-thirds of its users one year after signup. Because acquiring a new customer is almost always more expensive than retaining an existing one, it\u2019s typically more profitable to grow your active user base by improving retention than by increasing new user signups.", "Smiling retention is the ideal scenario: some inactive users return (Figure 3, green trace). Adding product categories can encourage user resurrection: four years after starting online book sales, Amazon began selling nearly everything else, prompting inactive book buyers to re-engage through a different set of products. Network effects also encourage resurrection: as the more drivers signed onto the platform, wait times for Uber rides dropped, and the service became more valuable to riders as a result. Similarly, as more smartphone users downloaded WhatsApp, early adopters saw friends join the platform and had reason to re-engage with the service.", "Retention gyrations aside, one thing remains certain: over the long term, every company will eventually lose all of its users. Consider a recent example: just a decade after claiming a 37% share of the US smartphone market, Blackberry will halt its phone production in 2020.", "It\u2019s often helpful to bin retention data along some dimension of interest. Grouping users by join date (Table 4) is one common implementation of this concept and is referred to as cohort analysis.", "Cohort analysis can surface insights related to user engagement across product iterations. Ideally, younger cohorts show a slower decline in engagement and higher long-term retention. While not necessarily evidence of causality, seeing an increase in user engagement over time is in line with improving product-market fit, and is not necessarily evident from averaged retention data alone.", "In parallel, brainstorming user actions that might correlate with retention can help to inspire positive product changes. In a well-known anecdote, Facebook\u2019s early growth team found a correlation between retention and the number of friends a new user acquires in their first 10 days on the platform. Based on this observation, the company was able to improve retention by funneling new users towards the critical \u201cadd friend\u201d action.", "You might also examine retention across user demographic information (e.g., age, gender, geography) or acquisition channel. Noting differences in retention between such groups can offer a call to action, perhaps motivating product changes to address the deficit or a doubling down on marketing to prospective users who fit the loyal profile.", "Projecting retention data beyond the time horizon of observed customer behavior offers a glimpse of your company\u2019s steady-state user engagement and is critical to estimate customer lifetime value (Section 3, Profitability).", "Consider a set of real retention data measuring customer engagement over 12 years (Figure 4, top, blue scatter points). Assume you\u2019re in year 6, and you want to forecast retention over the coming years. You might be forgiven for attempting to fit an exponential, though you\u2019d eventually discover that it underestimates long-term retention (dotted trace).", "The exponential function\u2019s failure to capture the shape of the observed retention data S(t) results from its implicit assumption that period-over-period (i.e., instantaneous) retention remains constant from one period to the next.", "But observed instantaneous retention, calculated as R(t) = S(t) \u00f7 S(t-1), clearly increases with customer tenure (Figure 4, bottom, orange scatter points). This is an example of mix shift: older cohorts have winnowed away users with high churn rate, leaving loyal users behind.", "The shifted beta geometric (sBG) retention model accommodates this observed increase in instantaneous retention R(t) by assuming that each customer has their own constant instantaneous renewal probability r and resulting survivorship probability r\u1d57 at time t. Across the customer base, the spread in r follows a beta distribution, and the resulting aggregate instantaneous retention across all customers varies with time as", "where parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 dictate the shape of r across the customer base.", "Fitting this sBG expression for R(t) onto the empirical instantaneous retention data (Figure 4, bottom), and subsequently backing out the cumulative retention function S(t) as the cumulative product of R(t), offers an excellent fit with the observed data (Figure 4, top, dashed line). See this notebook for the associated calculation. Having an accurate retention forecast will come in handy when calculating customer lifetime value (Section 3.3).", "The goal of any business is to make a profit, or generate revenues in excess of costs. This section outlines the connection between a company\u2019s user base and its revenues, costs, and resulting profitability.", "A company\u2019s revenue is typically distributed nonuniformly across its user base. For example, businesses generating revenue from advertisements or one-time product sales have a nearly continuous and potentially wide-ranging per-customer revenue spread whose shape can be approximated by a skewed (e.g., gamma or log-normal) distribution (Figure 5). This characteristic, reflecting the fact that a small number of customers contribute a disproportionate share of a company\u2019s revenue, is also seen in other measures of society such as household income, city populations, and name frequency.", "Even subscription-based businesses with just a few pricing plans see a broad set of possible values of revenue per user if users are spread across the globe. Netflix, for example, has only three pricing tiers but collects subscription fees in many currencies. As such, Netflix users in Switzerland pay over $22 per month while those in Colombia pay as little as $5 per month.", "Dividing the total revenue over a particular time interval by the active user count yields the average revenue per user (ARPU). Table 5 shows recent quarterly ARPU figures for selected companies.", "ARPU provides a useful link between a company\u2019s user count and its revenue. As shown in Figure 6, boosting revenue is a matter of increasing the size of the active user base (see Growth and Retention, Sections 1 and 2), increasing ARPU, or both. In the general case, ARPU can be boosted either by raising the average purchase frequency (number of purchases per unit time), the average order value, or both.", "Subscription-based businesses like Netflix or Spotify see customer revenues arriving on a regular schedule. Conversely, e-commerce, logistics, and social media companies have users generating revenue at particular instances of engagement and must find ways to incentivize their users to place more orders or click on more ads within a given period.", "Here\u2019s how you can increase purchase frequency:", "Conversely, here\u2019s how you can increase order value:", "Every business faces costs associated with creating their product or service. Such expenses are typically divided into fixed and variable costs, where variable costs scale with production volume. While variable costs are quite real for a company that bakes cookies or washes clothes, those focused on software development often bear virtually zero incremental cost to deliver their experience to one more customer.", "Instead of cost per output unit, expressing variable cost on a per user basis allows for a meaningful delineation of costs that scale with the number of customers reached (Figure 7). In this case, a company\u2019s total costs within a given period is the sum of fixed costs (salaries, buildings, equipment, etc.) and variable costs including the customer acquisition cost and the cost of goods sold.", "You can calculate your customer acquisition cost (CAC) by dividing the total spent on new user acquisition by the number of new users you\u2019ve acquired. If you\u2019re paying per ad click, your CAC is the product of clicks per conversion and the associated cost per click. CAC offers a vital measure of efficiency in marketing spend: a rule of thumb states that CAC should be limited to less than one-third of the customer lifetime value (see next section, Profitability).", "Here\u2019s how you can reduce customer acquisition cost:", "In addition to paying to acquire a user, you may pay something each time you deliver your product or service to them. This sum, your cost of goods sold (COGS) to each user, is the share of revenue you collect that goes to variable costs, or one minus your gross margin. Gross margin offsets fixed costs and determines the number of active users needed for the business to break even.", "This is tricky, but here\u2019s my cheeky advice to reduce your cost of goods:", "The value of a business is the present value of the expected cash flows (profit) to the company, discounted at a rate that reflects the riskiness of those cash flows. Table 6 shows quarterly earnings (profit) data for selected companies.", "Akin to company valuation, the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer is the present value of profits a newly-acquired user will contribute to your business.", "Estimating customer LTV is critical to establish your:", "A customer\u2019s LTV can be calculated by adding up the periodic (e.g., monthly, annual) cash flows (CF\u2081 + CF\u2082 + \u2026 + CFn) from the customer and applying the appropriate discount rate d:", "where cash flows are revenue minus COGS collected from the customer in period t, and the discount rate d is related to the company\u2019s cost of capital. With perfect knowledge of a customer\u2019s purchase intent, it\u2019s possible to calculate their LTV to your company. For instance, at a discount rate of 10%, if a customer delivers $100 in cash flows each year for 5 years, their LTV works out to be $417.", "Of course, you won\u2019t know in advance the cash flow schedule for each customer. In lieu of this, you can obtain a back-of-the-envelope customer LTV estimate by multiplying the expected incoming cash flows per unit time by the expected customer lifetime (Figure 8).", "To roughly project the total value of a customer to your business, estimate:", "As mentioned above, there are two shortcomings associated with this LTV model: (1) without discounting cash flows, we overemphasize the real value of money received far in the future, and (2) by assuming constant churn rate, we underestimate the true average customer lifetime.", "With just a bit more effort, it\u2019s possible to account for both the time value of money and the reduced churn rates of longer-tenure customers. In this case, recognizing that expected customer lifetime is the area under the retention function S(t), customer LTV can be expressed as the product of discounted cash flows and this more precise estimate of customer lifetime:", "Expected LTV is then the product of the area under the curve (Figure 9, bottom) and the average cash flows per period, CF. See this notebook for a sample calculation.", "The approach outlined above offers an LTV estimate for your average customer. But you might wish to find the LTV for a particular customer, or more importantly, identify your high-value customers. In this case, the beta-geometric negative binomial distribution (BG/NBD) model can be useful. This approach fits a list of transaction data (e.g., customer id, transaction date, amount) to four parameters describing the rate at which customers make purchases and the rate at which they drop out. This analysis yields a predicted monetary value for each user. Full implementation of the BG/NBD model is outside the scope of this article, but you can check out the associated Lifetimes Python library and resources for conceptual and practical guidance.", "Here\u2019s how you might increase customer lifetime value:", "There you have it!
