I find this way of learning quite effective. During my second year in college, I used to think that doing an online course on any of the platforms would be enough. But soon, I would forget what I learned in that course. That\u2019s when I started exploring and came across many websites that post Hackathon problems. I participated in a few but I couldn\u2019t solve the problems and did not understand where and how to start. Since my interest lies in Machine Learning and developing end-to-end applications I only participated in those.", "The problem was whenever we do a course online, they teach you the entire content of that topic, which to be honest is not required since that technologies keep on updating. So what I use to do is, I would search for that problem and what type of technologies are used to solve those problems.", "In this way, I came to know about many different technologies and also when and where to use those. I was in my second year, so at that time I only knew C and basics of C++ (OOPS). I did a course on Machine Learning with Python and that gave me an idea on how we can solve problems using Machine Learning. Now, I started participating in different hackathons on Hackerearth, TechGig, Analytics Vidhya. I was aware of Kaggle too but found that too difficult. I had a basic understanding of the concepts but not in the coding part like which libraries to use and stuff like that.", "In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t complete hackathon problems. But I kept working on the same problem even after the Hackathon due date was over. Just by reading articles and blogs from different websites, I came to know about different concepts as well as solve a part of the problem statement.", "Slowly, my pace increased and knew how to solve the problems and that\u2019s when I started submitting my solutions too. I was doing this along with college so it took time and my branch is not Computer, so it took me longer to learn those concepts from different blogs. Till then python became my favorite programming language and my interest grew in machine learning and deep learning a lot.", "Many problem statements could be solved by creating web applications. So I started exploring database technologies like Mongodb and AWS services and integrating those with python. I had worked on creating frontend static websites, so I had knowledge about HTML, CSS & BootStrap. I had participated in the Rakuten Hackathon where our idea was similar to that of Magicpin(coupons). So we created a fully working e-commerce website like amazon and it had all the functionalities. We used MongoDB as the database, HTML CSS & Bootstrap to make the frontend of the website, Flask to make the website dynamic, a recommendation system for the user. This one project as part of the hackathon gave me an entire overview of the full stack development process.", "My point being is if you have an end goal like making a working application for users to use then you get to learn a lot more than what you learn in an online course. The online course will guide but won\u2019t tell you where to use these concepts. When you participate in Hackathons the problem statements are real problems that need to be solved. Also, there is a high possibility that the task you are trying to do is not available on StackOverflow, so you need to think out of the box to complete that task. So you get to experience that as well as understand how good your skills are. I find this as the best way to test my skills and learn along the way.", "Currently, I am in my final year and learning new things by making applications with different technologies.", "This is my personal experience that I wanted to share.", "Your home for data science.
