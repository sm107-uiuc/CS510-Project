After more than a year on Medium, I noticed Machine learning models are often highly sought after topics for aspiring data scientists. However, most foundational statistical knowledge is ignored because it\u2019s not \u201csexy\u201d. As I brush up on my knowledge of statistics, I hope that I can also inspire aspiring data scientist to learn the foundations first before moving onto other advanced statistical models and experimentation methods.", "Note: All quoted definitions are from Practical Statistics for Data Scientists written by Peter Bruce and Andrew Bruce.", "In this article, I will cover the following concepts:", "Before data scientists begin ANY analysis, they need to determine if they are including all users or a subset of your users. This sounds simple, but in the real world, it\u2019s easy to mistake a sample for the whole population.", "For example: A data scientist surveys University of Washington alumni, the class of 2019, in order to determine the average income entering the workforce. You find out the average income is $150,000. Is it correct to assume, that if you graduate from University of Washington, you will make around $150,000? Probably not. The respondents of the survey is a \u201csample\u201d of the University of Washington alumni class of 2019 \u201cpopulation\u201d. It could contain biases in your analysis if you decide to use the data from the survey for your analysis.", "When beginning your data analysis, think about whether your data is from a sample or a population. If you\u2019re using a sample, make sure that you\u2019re using a random sample to if you would like to do an analysis or create a model to generalize your findings to the whole population.", "From Practical Statistics for Data Scientists:", "Population = Collection of all items of interest to our study (N)", "Sample = A subset of the population (n)", "Simple Random Sample = Drawing a subset of the population at random where each item in the population has an equal chance of being chosen into the subset (without stratification).", "This topic will become very important when conducting experiments aka(also known as) hypothesis testing, and it is often overlooked. As a data scientist at Microsoft, I often run into sample ratio mismatches, where samples from the control and treatment group are not even which is a good alert to investigate the data we are analyzing for AB tests. Sample mismatches can be caused by various reasons like the logic of the code for certain features and behavior changes introduced by the treatment. It will need to be resolved before conducting any further analysis.", "Remember: Data quality > Data Quantity.", "Yes, this is probably a topic you\u2019ve heard of a million times. However, in practice, this can be often overlooked because many tools make it much easier to calculate mean over a median. Also, by being aware and familiarizing yourself with all the measures of central tendency, you can find new insights that you can easily glance over using the most basic estimation, the mean.", "Mean = The sum of all values divided by the number of values (50th percentile)", "Generally, the mean is a good measure for the population that are normally distributed, but you may miss out if the data becomes skewed or have different types of distributions. Here is a good article to learn about distributions: \u201c6 Common Probability Distributions every data science professional should know\u201d", "Here are other types of means that could also be useful.", "Weighted Mean = The sum of all values times a weight divided by the sum of the weights.", "In many data sets, some of the values might \u201cweigh\u201d more than others. For example, if Google is analyzing rating of a mobile app. They might want to put more weight in star ratings that are more recent over star ratings that were given over one year ago.", "Trimmed Mean =The average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values.", "This type of mean eliminates influence from outliers. For example, if Facebook is analyzing engagement of users in terms of minutes in their mobile app. data scientists might want to remove certain users that could possibly be \u201cbots\u201d that have unreasonable engagement time.", "Median = The value such that one-half of the data lies above and below", "The median is also described as the 50th percentile. Median can be a very robust average estimate when there are outliers introduced in the data OR the data doesn\u2019t have a normal distribution. For example, I saw an article about the average pay for tech employees in Seattle being $279K. It states it is not using the median in the article. This is the same as if you take an average of 10 employees where everyone's\u2019 pay is ~$100K and one of the employees is the CEO making $1,000,000. This could throw off the average and make the company look like the employees on average make $190K. Yes, an average company doesn\u2019t have 10 employees, but most C level executives make a much more substantial amount than an average employee.", "Mode = The value that occurs the most", "This is a fairly simple calculation, but it can be very helpful in getting quick insights. For example, if a data scientist was measuring app usage for TikTok and they measure the # of users by # of active days in the last 7 days, they might be able to find quickly on average how many # of active days that most users use the app for in an average week.", "If you\u2019re asking yourself now, what measure is the best, understand that no measure is \u201cbest\u201d for all data. However, you should get in the habit of checking all of the measures for your data to make sure that you are not missing out on certain insights.", "Asides from measuring the central tendency to analyze data, data scientists also measure the variability. One of the most common measures of variability is deviation. The distance of the value from the mean. Although the calculation of deviation is much more intuitive to understand, the output will often be actually less intuitive, which is why we use variance and standard deviation.", "Variance= The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n-1 where n is the number of data values", "Standard Deviation = The square root of the variance", "Although variance is a good measure of variability, in statistics, we often use standard deviation because variance tends to be large due to the squaring, and standard deviation is much more comparable (in units) to measures of central tendency. In experiments, data scientists will often use 2 standard deviations as the threshold to measure significance. I won\u2019t go into experiments in this article, but this is an important concept for all data scientists.", "Standard deviation is the most common measure of variability for a single dataset, but where comparing two or more datasets, there is a coefficient of variation.", "Coefficient of variation= The standard deviation divided by the sample mean.", "Other not as popular measures of variability are range, percentile, and median absolute deviation and interquartile range, but I won\u2019t go over those in this article since they are much less commonly used in practice.", "In almost any data analyses, data scientists will compare two variables and how they relate with one another. There are two different values that measure this relation: correlation coefficient (r). Another measure that is pretty similar in concept is the term \u201ccovariance,\u201d but the calculation of it is different and is less commonly used by data scientists.", "Correlation coefficient = A metric that measures the extent to which numeric variables are associated with one another (commonly described as r and ranges from \u20131 to +1).", "Below is an example of computing Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient.", "Often, when you are comparing a feature variable and a target variable, you will measure the correlation to see how they relate to one another. One important thing to remember is that correlation does not mean causation. For example, if a data scientist was analyzing Twitter app retention, they could falsely state that more tweets from a user lead to higher retention. However, there could be a confounding variable \u2014 another variable (i.e. # of followers) that caused both # of tweets and retention to go up. That is why it is always important to experiment!", "In part 2, I will cover hypothesis testing aka experiments.", "Your home for data science.
