Your results can be more reliable, you can (hopefully) conclusively prove or disprove a given hypothesis. However, there is such a thing as having too much data, or at least having so much data that it\u2019s hard to efficiently run certain models. Depending on your specific problem, there are a few different ways you can approach this problem.", "Just because you started with millions of data points doesn\u2019t mean you have to actually run all those points through whatever model you choose. In fact, it\u2019s a good idea to not do that! When you\u2019re processing data, the first thing you need to do is edit your data so every point is actually helpful because bigger is not always better.", "Say your project has something to do with population heights. One of the big things you want to do is make some kind of histogram showing the distribution of people\u2019s height. If you see a bunch over by 0, chances are you\u2019re not dealing with a subsection of microscopic people (unless that data comes from a certain island in Gulliver\u2019s Travels). By that same token, if there are a lot of measurements that are noticeably higher, you\u2019ve found more outliers as well that can be cut out from your data frame. Basically, unless there is an explainable reason (like collecting your data from islands where the populations are abnormally large or small), these outliers can and should be cut out from your dataset.", "This is way less self-explanatory than the first question, but still very important in cleaning your data. Say you have a dataset that records every time a customer makes a given purchase. If you want to look at the most recent buying trends, you may either want to only include a customer\u2019s most recent purchase or only include the data points recorded within a certain time frame. If you want to get an idea about what customers buy what, it may be more useful to add every customer\u2019s purchase and just have one row per customer.", "Relatedly, use your domain knowledge. If you don\u2019t have a great deal of domain knowledge, ask around or look things up. By having domain knowledge, not only will your hypothesis be clearer, but you\u2019ll have a better idea of exactly what you need to reject or confirm your hypothesis. To give a highly basic example, if your hypothesis is that people who buy an above average amount of beauty products also buy healthier food, you would use domain knowledge of what is or isn\u2019t a beauty product to filter your dataset. Of course, this is a highly simplified example, but you get the idea.", "In essence, be clear about your experiment and your hypothesis, and be clear about exactly what information you need to prove or disprove your hypothesis. There\u2019s no one clear solution, like there is in checking for outliers. This is one of the parts of data science that requires a bit more creativity and critical thinking, but is immensely valuable in creating a quality dataset.", "If we\u2019re dealing with a dataframe, or table, the last section tackles the issue of having too many rows. This section tackles the issue of having too many columns. Just like you don\u2019t need every data point to run a good model, you don\u2019t (necessarily) need every feature. In fact, if you\u2019re at the point where you have too many features, it\u2019s likely you can edit them down for the issue at hand.", "Not all features are created equally. There are some columns that will almost certainly have data for every data point (and the ones were there isn\u2019t data in that row will likely be thrown out). However, some more specialized features may not have information for every row. They may also only have values for a handful of data points. For example, going back to the example of having a dataframe of customer shopping behavior, if there is a column about how many people bought a limited edition bacon flavored yogurt, and only 5 people bought that, it might be a lot easier to just delete that column entirely. That said, if the thought of just throwing out an entire column is totally abhorrent to you, you can also try to consolidate multiple features into one feature. Going back to our bacon flavored yogurt example, you could consolidate all the yogurt flavor purchases into one column that just says how much yogurt a consumer bought. You could also consolidate columns into how many products from a certain brand were bought. Again, this is a great example of how domain knowledge and critical thinking are vital tools for data scientists. By knowing exactly what you need to prove or disprove a hypothesis, you can compress features into one feature that will still provide the information you need.", "What is collinearity? It\u2019s the quality of being collinear. What does it mean to be collinear? If we look at the wikipedia page, being collinear means the following:", "Two variables are perfectly collinear if there is an exact linear relationship between them.", "In essence, as one independent variable increases, another independent variable either increases or decreases at the same rate. Detecting and remedying this issue can be very complicated and could be its own blog post. In fact, someone did a blog post on this! So instead of going on about collinearity here, here\u2019s the TDS post that goes into greater detail about what collinearity is and how to fix it.", "There are two big regularization techniques people use, lasso and ridge regression. Both reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting by penalizing certain data features, and you can read more about how they work here and here. The reason I specify lasso regression in this instance is that unlike in ridge regression, lasso regression will reduce some coefficients down to 0 (basically knocking out that feature) whereas ridge regression will just make them very very tiny. Therefore, if one of your main objectives is to reduce dimensionality (or the number of columns in your dataframe), lasso regression would be the way to go.", "In all the above steps, while you may delete features or condense multiple features into one, you still know what every feature is and what it\u2019s denoting. The reason I specifically put principal component analysis, or PCA, last is that you will no longer have that knowledge of what all your features are. However, PCA is for the express purpose of reducing data dimensionality, so it\u2019s a useful tool to have, although I personally would say it\u2019s a last resort.", "There\u2019s two ways you can approach PCA, you can either specify how much of the variance you want to maintain (for example you could say you want to maintain 85% of the variance). You could also say how many variables you want the final dataframe to have (for example you could say you want only two or three variables so they can be plotted on a graph). In the first example, you don\u2019t know how many variables will be returned, and in the other example, you don\u2019t know how much of the variance is maintained. Therefore, the approach you take is dependent on what you want to accomplish. For example, do you want data that is easy to visualize? If so, you\u2019d want to specify two or three variables. Do you want to merely simplify your dataframe and just reduce the number of variables? In that case, specify the percent of variance you want to maintain.", "While there are probably other ways to edit and simplify your dataset than what I\u2019ve covered here, this is good jumping off point of steps to take when you need to edit and simplify data. While there are plenty of technical steps you can implement (such as PCA and ridge regression), a big component of data editing is utilizing your domain knowledge and critical thinking. While of course data scientists need to know statistics and algorithms, this is the reason why data scientists also need creativity and the ability to think outside the box.", "Your home for data science.
