If you ask for a huge amount of resources or a large amount of money to people who have never seen the benefits a well-planned, executed and designed data science project can bring, then they\u2019ll never agree.", "The key here is to stick to:", "A nice way of doing this is rather than delivering a full product stick to a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) strategy. Here you try to deliver just enough that you can demonstrate if a full project is feasible.", "It also has the great benefit of giving you a better idea for the full project of:", "To help I will give a basic example we can go through.", "You work for a firm that manages roads for a local authority. As a new joiner to the firm you note that one of their main problems with maintenance on the aging roads is dealing with the number of potholes that require fixing each year.", "Potholes require water ingress and traffic in order to form. What happens is that water gets into cracks in the top surface, it freezes and expands pushing the road surface up and increasing the cracks. When it thaws and contracts a hole under the surface is left, which the weight of traffic then breaks up. This material is then lost, and the hole widens over time.", "A nice illustrated graphic of this process is shown below:", "Therefore, potholes can increase over time as roads age and cracks start to form. If left to grow (around 40 mm deep is considered needing urgent repairs in some areas) it can become big enough that it can damage vehicles and claims can be made against the councils (and they claim it back from the company).", "The company tries to repair potholes and a planned repair is 17% cheaper than an emergency repair. The issue they have is keeping track of potholes and monitoring the condition of roads.", "Currently the firm has teams it drives around the road network it manages to examine and mark areas of road that require maintenance. However, they tend to spend a lot of time on high volume roads and the firm only has a few teams of trained personnel that can do it.", "This means that lots of side roads are not monitored actively and rely on reporting by the public to be brought to attention and often this is when they are already very large and requiring immediate repair.", "As a data scientist at the company we recognise that an opportunity exists. If we could get footage of the road network, we could apply a vision-based machine learning solution to recognise the holes. If we coupled it with a GPS, we could then build a map and mark where they are.", "Just think of it! We could get someone to drive along the network once a week or month with a dash mounted camera and some electronics and we generate an active image of the road quality. We could even add in some other issues (like foreign objects on the road or damaged manhole covers). Just think how this could revolutionise how the business works! We would go from a heavily reactive to a pro-active one.", "This is generally when you find these projects go nowhere. While your boss or line manager may see that it is not a bad idea (of course they wouldn\u2019t have hired you otherwise), they probably do not have the budget or sign off for what you are asking for and neither the reach to get the different stakeholders involved as it crosses departments.", "These are the ones you need to convince, and they aren\u2019t keen. This can be because they\u2019ve never seen what a successful data science project can do, but also if you think about what you are asking for:", "Add all of this together and you can see this is not a small resource request and if it doesn\u2019t succeed that could be a lot to lose and they\u2019d have to answer for it.", "Well this is where the POC thoughts come in. We just need to show that the key deliverable is possible.", "This is a key thing to think about, because if it\u2019s their first data science project and it goes badly wrong, they may never buy into another project again. Doing a lower risk POC might enable you to make sure you don\u2019t lose the ability to try again.", "Can we detect potholes to a reliable enough level that it is worth developing into a business capability?", "We also want to thin this down so we are asking for enough resources that we can do this to. If we think about what we need to show the key deliverable all we need is:", "This is where some resourcefulness can be useful. Often you can find there are large repositories of different open source datasets which while maybe not perfect can fit the bill and after a bit of foraging there is indeed a pothole dataset on Kaggle.", "Model wise this is part of being a data scientist and I would probably look at using an existing image recognition model and transfer learn so we don\u2019t need a huge amount of new images to re-train it and also we should get superior performance than if we trained from start.", "This should all be possible on the computing resources you have at your disposal as a data scientist (e.g. a powerful laptop or access to a computing resource on the company server).", "Note: If you don\u2019t have access to any computing resource, now is a good time to tell your work that you need it to do your job.", "I used TensorFlow as my ML tool of choice and LabelImg to label the raw images with potholes.", "I did around 150 images and then split it into 100 for training and 50 for testing. This smaller curated set was useful as I could select images that look as similar as I would expect for a dash camera taken image (i.e. they are looking up the road like a car would travel).", "I then set my model training and looked at the output. I\u2019ve put an example below, but the results were pretty good. I set myself a deadline of just a day so I had to stop the model training early, but it looked like it was achieving around 70% accuracy, which is pretty good for a draft model!", "So, what do we do with this? Well what we have done is taken some very rough data, done some rough cleaning and quick training on it and are getting very good results. We know that with more data that is in line with what we expect (a lot of images aren\u2019t quite inline for a dash cam footage) and we only very quickly trained a mode on a small dataset getting a good result.", "We can confidently say that we would expect performance to be at or above this level and we have images and results we can compile into a defined path and use real images to show comparable results of what a full system might work with. For example, we can now show them a design like this:", "While it may not look important. Being able to show actual results and give a better handle on things can help and with some numbers we can start to make a business case.", "Combined this together we can then say that we would expect to save 17% on 70% of the potholes that are there.", "From here I would encourage getting some firm numbers so that the stakeholders can see the potential and see whether the cost of running a full project of this would be worthwhile.", "For example, if we find that:", "We can now say that currently the costs are:", "With this new system we can say we would hope for at least:", "This estimated minimum saving can then be evaluated by stakeholders to better balance the risk/rewards, but also against project costs. You could also expand the savings by saying how it could affect the wider network as well. All this from a day of work!", "With this sort of POC you can go from a vague proposition to a much firmer position and the start of a business cost to get people on board.", "We went from a grand project vision with only subjective savings and costs, to a small resource cost (which your manager can probably give you) with a POC whose results can start to give ideas of resourcing and savings. From there you can build a case that will increase your chances of selling a data science project.", "This tends to be a strategy I use throughout my work. Instead of trying to sell and start with huge projects, a smaller scope project revolving around the key deliverables can often lower the risks and increase your chances of success. It will also tend to mean you do a lot of different things, which is good if you like variety.", "Note: Where possible I\u2019ve tried to use realistic numbers wherever possible. However, in some cases I\u2019ve used numbers that seemed reasonable. These are of course for illustrative purposes only.", "Data Scientist, Astrophysics PhD, reliability engineer and part time writer.
