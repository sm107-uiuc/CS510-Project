It\u2019s too easy to let the hours, days and weeks fly by without doing anything constructive. Use this extra time as a gift to be proactive.", "These are the most common skills that are getting very popular among Data Scientists.", "It needs no introduction as it is very common to containerize your applications. But let\u2019s understand with an example, why it is so helpful.", "Let\u2019s say you have built an application for object detection with the help of TensorFlow lite for embedded devices. It has to be deployed on 20 raspberry devices. Now, the problem is that you\u2019ll have to copy the source code to all the raspberry pie devices and install the requirements and also set up a process control monitor to make sure the applications starts right away when the device restarts or boots up. You understand the complexity of this setup and you have to perform a similar setup on 20 devices. There are very high chances that you\u2019ll make some mistakes and will spend a considerable amount of time fixing it. Also, if there is any update, you understand the complexity.", "Now, let\u2019s look at Docker\u2019s implementation of a similar setup. You\u2019ll not need any process control monitor to start the application as the device boots up because there is a parameter restart, just set it to always. We will use the Docker Image of the application. This will make sure that every raspberry pie is getting the same code and this way ways can also be installed easily.", "Flask is a microframework to create API for machine learning models or databases. It is super easy to learn and use.", "This is a sample snippet of code to use flask", "Most of the time you\u2019ll be using a similar script and you\u2019re colleagues like front-end developers or back-end developers will be asking you the API and payload.", "This is considered one of the most boring things to do but trust me you\u2019ll have to start writing tests. The reason is when your application starts growing and multiple people are working on it, it gets hard to keep track of things that change and by change, I don\u2019t mean in Git. Imagine suddenly one of the features of the application stopped working because of someone who updated a piece of code. Now, if there were tests it could be easily detected before it was deployed.", "You may ask what if someone forgot to run test cases before deploying it. Well, this is where CI/CD comes handy. You can create a pipeline that will run tests on the code and then deploy it. If the tests fail then your application won\u2019t be deployed.", "Sentry is used for alerts that you\u2019ll have to set up on your data science application. I consider it a part of Monitoring Machine Learning Models. The difference is that we are using it to monitor errors, not performance. Monitoring for errors is a very important thing to address when you have deployed your model and it is still in early stages.", "You could also use Telegram or Slack API to send all the errors or warnings to a group where all the team members can look.", "Many people consider these things as work of DevOps but let me tell you honestly it increases your skillset and adds more value to your resume and also if you are working in a startup, chances are you\u2019ll have to do something similar on your own.", "Your home for data science.
