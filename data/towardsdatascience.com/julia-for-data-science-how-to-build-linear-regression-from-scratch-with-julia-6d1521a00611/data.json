Unfortunately, the high-level and elegant abstractions from these programming usually come at a cost, especially when working with large systems. Before we even begin, this post will not be some endless bashing of either Python or R so any reader with such expectations should look elsewhere. Rather, this post seeks to enlighten and inform readers about the potential addition of Julia to their toolbox. At the end of the day, all these programming languages are mere tools with different use cases.", "Julia is described as a dynamic programming language which focuses on being highly performant even with high-level abstractions. As a result, this language is well suited for numerical and scientific computing. Julia was co-created by 4 computer scientists (3 of which are pictured below ) in 2009.", "This line has been one of the most-used references, to sum up, the main advantage of this programming language. Some readers may have read about the infamous \u201ctwo language problem\u201d. For the uninitiated ones, the two language problem simply describes the situation where;", "developers have to re-write the critical and performant parts of a codebase in a low-level language like C/C++ as high-level languages like Python/R can be slow with certain tasks due to their high-level abstractions", "It is comparably easier to quickly prototype new ideas in high-level languages like Python and R. A major reason why these languages have such a dominant position in the data science ecosystem which heavily relies on trying new ideas as quickly as possible. The tradeoff (in terms of speed) here is acceptable for small and medium scale applications but very noticeable on large scale systems and applications.", "Julia is being dubbed as the language that can solve this two-language problem by offering the friendliness of a high-level language like Python/R while matching the speed of a low-level language like C/C++.", "I had heard about Julia but I always wondered about its usage. Is it as easy as it is with Python/R?", "This post simply tries to test this assertion by building from scratch multivariate linear regression using gradient descent with Julia. I have been using both Python and R for some years now so I decided to see how fast I can use Julia to quickly solve such a task. This post won\u2019t be a benchmark test between Julia and other languages as such tests are well covered but rather a focus on the user-friendliness of the language to someone who is used to Python/R. I will end the post with some final thoughts after this process.", "The dataset that will be used for this test is the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set (Sheet5) from the UCI data repository. The aim here is to generate a model that can predict Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) from 4 numerical (continuous) features:", "The plan of attack for this experiment is just like a typical modelling workflow where the data will be:", "As you may have noticed, the features are on different scales (from percentages to millibars) which might be problematic for most algorithms so it\u2019s common practice to standardise features so that they can be on the same \u2018scale\u2019. The two functions in the code snippet below are used to standardise both the training and testing features.", "Our data is now pre-processed and ready for modelling.", "With our cost function defined, let\u2019s deploy gradient descent to find us the best weights for each of the features (including a constant as well) that minimises this cost function. The next function takes care of that:", "NB: This implementation implements gradient descent without regularisation (which I encourage you to add to your own implementations).", "Let\u2019s now check if gradient descent works and minimises our cost function by plotting our cost history vector \ud835\udc09:", "As one can see from the plot, the cost drops as the number of iterations increases until it flatlines at some point. It appears that gradient descent is doing a good job of finding the weights that minimise our cost function.", "It\u2019s now time to make some predictions and evaluate the performance of our new shiny regression model. Two new functions are used to generate predictions and score both the training and testing datasets.", "From the scoring function, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the training and testing set are:", "Let\u2019s now look at the predictive powers (in terms of R-squared value) of the model in both datasets as well with this function:", "However, the testing score is better than the training score which appears to suggest that the model is underfitting data. Tinkering with the alpha term (\u03b1) and/or the number of iterations (n_iter) should squeeze more performance from this model but I will leave that up to readers to tinker with.", "From this experiment, I naturally have some likes and dislikes with Julia based on my previous interactions with Python and R.", "Julia is a promising language that is built from the ground up for numerical and scientific computing. In this post, I have shown that it\u2019s relatively easy to prototype in Julia and successfully implemented a multivariate linear regression using gradient descent. It\u2019s one language that every data should at least keep and a digital eye on. There are some amazing data science packages out there for Julia. Grab some dataset, play with Julia and let me know what you think? The best way to get up and running, in my opinion, is to install JuliaPro which comes with an IDE using Atom.", "As always I look forward to feedback (good or bad!). The script with all the functions for this post can be found on the GitHub repository for this blog. Finally, you can check out other posts on my personal blog.
