It has fared remarkably well especially in areas of perceptual problems like seeing and hearing which were once impossible for machines to tackle. My first tryst with Deep Learning occurred a couple of years ago when I was working on problems in Kaggle. It was here that I was introduced to Keras and I thought of exploring it in detail. Out of all the other deep learning libraries that I have come across, I found Keras extremely easy, flexible and straightforward to use. The documentation and examples were also convenient and easy to follow.", "For having a stronger grasp over the subject, I have been following a book called \u201cDeep Learning with Python\u201d by Francois Chollet who also happens to be the author of Keras. It has already become one of my most favored book on the topic, and I have learned quite a lot from it. Like I always say, I have a habit of creating notes while reading any book, so here are my notes from the Deep learning with Python book. I have tried to summarise the essential concepts and presented them in the form of an article. For anyone who is thinking to start or has just begun their journey into the Deep Learning world will find these notes useful.", "The objective of this article is to get acquainted with the world of Keras, its installation, deployment and how it can be used to solve a Machine Learning problem. This article does not deal with advanced deep learning concepts like LSTM, Convets, etc. I intend to cover those topics in my next series of articles.", "Since you have ventured into the field of Deep learning and you are particularly interested in Keras, it is assumed that you:", "Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning. Deep Learning emphasizes learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. The deep in deep learning stands for the idea of using successive layers of representations. These layered representations are learned through models called neural networks which are structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other.", "In general, three technical forces are driving major advances in machine learning today", "It is due to abundance and improvements in all these three fields today that Deep learning has gained momentum.", "Some of the major successes that deep learning has achieved are:", "Keras (\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2) means horn in Greek. It is a reference to a literary image from ancient Greek and Latin literature, first found in the Odyssey. Keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System). Keras is a framework for building deep neural networks with Python. Keras enables us to build state-of-the-art, deep learning systems just like those used at Google and Facebook, with little complexity and also with a few lines of code. Some of its key features are:", "Keras is a front-end layer written in Python that runs on top of other popular deep learning toolkits like TensorFlow, Theano and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). Any piece of code that you write with Keras can be run with any of these backends without having to change anything in the code. Via TensorFlow/Theano /CNTK, Keras can run seamlessly on both CPUs and GPUs.", "Before installing Keras, we need to install one of its backend engines, i.e., either of the three: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. In this article, we shall be working with the TensorFlow backend. Read the detailed instructions here to install Tensorflow.", "There are two ways to install Keras:", "If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:", "Then, cd to the Keras folder and run the install command:", "Please refer to the Keras official documentation for any installation related queries.", "The author recommends (although not strictly necessary) that you run deep-learning code on a modern NVIDIA GPU. Alternatively, you can consider running your experiments on an AWS EC2 GPU instance or on Google Cloud Platform(this gets expensive over time).", "In this article, I shall be using Jupyter notebooks to get started with Keras, although that isn\u2019t a requirement: you can also run standalone Python scripts or run code from within an IDE such as PyCharm.", "A typical machine learning workflow is as follows:", "A Keras workflow is no different and to completely understand it; we will be working with the example of a neural network that uses Keras to classify handwritten digits. It is the famous MNIST database problem also called the \u201cHello World\u201d of deep learning. The problem is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 \u00d7 28 pixels) into their ten categories (0 through 9).", "The MNIST dataset comes preloaded in Keras in the form of a set of four Numpy arrays.", "Let us underline the steps that we will undertake to solve this problem using Keras.", "The images are encoded as Numpy arrays, and the labels are an array of digits, ranging from 0 to 9. The multidimensional Numpy arrays, in which data is stored are called Tensors. You can think of tensors as a container for data. To be more specific tensors are a generalization of matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions. Tensors can be defined by three key features:", "Let\u2019s have a look at the training and testing data.", "So what we have here is a 3D tensor of 8-bit integers. More precisely, it\u2019s an array of 60,000 matrices of 28 \u00d7 28 integers. Each such matrix is a grayscale image, with coefficients between 0 and 255.", "Before feeding in the inputs, we will need to preprocess the data. This is done by reshaping it into a shape that is expected by the network. We will also scale all the values between the range(0,1).", "The labels will also need to be categorically encoded since we cannot feed the lists of integers into a neural network.", "A Deep learning network essentially consists of models and layers.", "A layer is a core building block of a neural network. It acts as a kind of a data processing module. Layers extract representations out of the input data, that is fed into them. Inherently, Deep learning consists of stacking up these layers to form a model.", "Layers are the LEGO bricks of deep learning", "A model is a linear stack of layers. It is like a sieve for data processing made of a succession of increasing refined data filters called layers. The simplest model in Keras is sequential, which is built by stacking layers sequentially.", "We will be building our very first model in Keras with only two layers. Here, we\u2019re passing the expected shape of the input data to the first layer.", "Our network consists of a sequence of two layers, which are densely connected (also called fully connected) neural layers.", "Different layers are best suited for different types of data processing. The general rule(not a thumb rule) is :", "We now know that our network consists of two dense layers each of which is applying some tensor operations on the input data. The operations involve weight tensors, and it is at these weights that the knowledge of the network is present.", "After the model has been built, we enter the compilation phase, which primarily consists of three essential elements:", "Essentially, the reduction of the loss happens via mini- batch stochastic gradient descent. The exact rules governing a specific use of gradient descent are defined by the rmsprop optimizer passed as the first argument.", "We\u2019re now ready to train the network, which in Keras is done via a call to the network\u2019s fit method \u2014 we fit the model to its training data:", "The network will start to iterate on the training data in mini-batches of 128 samples, 5 times over (each iteration over all the training data is called an epoch). At each iteration, the network will compute the gradients of the weights about the loss on the batch, and update the weights", "Two quantities are displayed during training:", "The accuracy on the training data comes out to be around 98.9% Now let\u2019s check how the model performs on the test set.", "The test-set accuracy turns out to be 97.8% \u2014 that\u2019s quite a bit lower than the training set accuracy. But then that is the issue famously known as overfitting in ML terminology. You can avoid it by creating a validation sample of about 10,000 images from the original training data and setting it aside. The testing can be done on this sample since it has not been exposed to the training before. The entire code can be accessed from here.", "So that\u2019s pretty much it. We have worked through the whole MNIST digit classification problem in detail with the help of Keras. We just built and trained a neural network from scratch. However, theory is one aspect of learning, and its practical application is another. So get up and get going. Utilise your new found knowledge by working on some real datasets. I will see you in the next part where we will learn to utilise Keras for some advanced problems. Till then happy reading.", "Your home for data science.
