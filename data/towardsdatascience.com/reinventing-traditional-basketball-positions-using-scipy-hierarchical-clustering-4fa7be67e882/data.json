I wanted to investigate the change in positions as of the 2018\u201319 NBA season.", "The first thing I had to do was to scrape all of the season averages for all active players in the NBA. I used the code shown in this article. This gave me all of the stats on this page on basketball-reference.com.", "The operation that I would be doing with this data is called hierarchical clustering. Also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, it\u2019s an algorithm that clusters objects (in this case, players) by their similar stats. I used a module called SciPy to do this. The parameters I used were FG, FGA, FG%, 3P, 3PA, 3P%, 2P, 2PA, 2P%, eFG%, FT, FTA, FT%, ORB, DRB, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, PF, and PTS. All other stats were irrelevant to the investigation however I did use the amount of Games played, minutes played per game as well as points to filter out players of low value. I got rid of all players averaging less than 10 points per game, playing less than 20 minutes a game (that\u2019s about 42% of a game) and also those that played less than 50 games in the season (that's 61% of the available games).", "The first thing I had to do was scrape the stats. That was the easy part as I just used the code in the article stated previously. That returned the stats in a pandas data frame. The first problem with this is that the players' stats were stored as strings and I needed them as floats so I changed them before they were put into a data frame and they were in a 2-dimensional array.", "\u2018forbidden\u2019 is the indexes of the strings in the data frame (name, position and team) and \u2018player_stats\u2019 is the 2-dimensional array.", "Then I needed to filter out the stats. Some players have missing stats, Kostas Antetokounmpos 3P%, for example, is missing so I had to remove all players who had any empty stats. This only happens with the percentages.", "This creates the data-frame, removes the position and team (irrelevant to the investigation) and replaces any empty values with \u201cNaN\u201d (a common placeholder) and then drops any rows from the data frame that have this placeholder. Then I needed to drop rows that didn't meet the criteria I specified previously.", "Then I needed to do the final preparations. I needed to remove the names of the players, the games and games started. All three of these fields are unnecessary to the investigation so I just dropped them into a new data frame as I wanted to preserve the names for the dendrogram (the graph outputted).", "Then I needed to get the names in a NumPy N-dimensional array as this is the format the labels for the dendrogram need to be passed into the heirarchichal clustering function.", "Then finally I had to set the plot size, the resolution, gave the dendrogram a title and then all that was left to do was to was pass these parameters into the SciPy hierarchical clustering function and then show the dendrogram", "From the resulting dendrogram, I managed to deduce 5 different positions. Please bear in mind that these results are from the 2018\u201319 NBA season and are not reflective of the players' entire career.", "Traditional big men are a dying breed. They are being expected to stretch the floor more than they are being expected to post up with their back to the basket. Their rebounding and rim protection is amazing but their lack of shooting ability in the modern games limits their scoring volume. These players have high FG% but low to no 3PA. Some of these players include;", "These players excel in nearly all areas of the game. Rebounding, steals, points, assists while also having a good (not great) 3 point shot. These types of players are typically some of the best in the league. Some of these players include;", "Ball handlers are\u2026 well, ball handlers. Their scoring volume can vary greatly but one thing they all have in common is that they all have high assists numbers. All though not measured in this investigation, their usage rates would all be high. Some of these players include;", "Stretch fours are power forwards that have a 3 point shot. They can drive to the basket effectively but are also effective from catch and shoot 3 situations. They also generally put up high rebound numbers and low assist numbers but there are exceptions to this. Some of these players included are;", "Although these players might not be only limited to 3-pointers, they certainly do have a talent for attempting many 3s at a high success rate. These players are fantastic scorers that can either create their own shot or play off the ball with catch and shoot threes. Some of these players include;", "Firstly, I want to say that the results from the investigation is NOT 100% correct and you shouldn\u2019t take my word for it. There is only so much you can deduce from these stats. Other things like usage rate and shot location as well as play style were not taken into account. Although there is a lot of room for improvement, there is some truth to this in my opinion however, make of it what you will.
