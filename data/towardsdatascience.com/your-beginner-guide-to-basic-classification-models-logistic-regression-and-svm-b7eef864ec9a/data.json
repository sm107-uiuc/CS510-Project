I do.", "I have a little niece, she is 1 year old and she is very smart, whenever that I point a cat to her, she always say \u201cMiao\u201d without me even telling her what it is. No matter what color of its fur or its size, without fails, she can identify it as a cat.", "So how can she identify the cat? Interestingly, through every observation, she learnt which one is a cat and which one is not. This is a part of her mental model. Of course, through our interaction with her. Every time she sees an animal, we would say. \u201cLook it is a cat\u201d. She will say \u201cMiao\u201d to confirm. Then whenever she sees a small dog (chihuahua for example) and says \u201cMiao\u201d, we will say, no, it is a dog.", "Slowly, she learns to pick up more accurately by each observation, which one is a dog or which one is a cat. Of course it extends to which one is tiger, sheep, and even elephants. Her mental model evolves by each observation she has.", "Similarly, in machine learning, we would find various classification problems. Remember pursuit of Happiness Will Smith? Imagine you were a sales broker, you would need to identify the buyers from lots of potential customers. You could reach out to any of them but with very limited time and energy. The question is, which one will buy your products?", "Classification is a supervised problem where you have a labeled dataset. This means you could use historical data and labels to predict the the labels from any new observations. Finally, a model we can use to predict our spouse\u2019s mood \u2014 How wonderful would that make our lives!!!", "Without further ado, my job here is to walk you through the two basics of classification machine learning models :Logistic regression and SVM.", "I would attempt to make this guide very clear and suitable for beginners with added references for further learning. Please comment if there are any confusions.", "Logistic Regression is a classification model used to predict the odds in favor of a particular event. The odds ratio represents the positive event which we want to predict, for example how likely a sample has breast cancer in the UCI dataset.", "The odds ratio are also commonly defined as logit which is simply the logarithm of the odds ratio (log-odds). Note here that the log refers to the natural logarithm and takes the input value between 0 to 1. This means it represents the conditional probability of positive event given a certain feature.", "To understand this formula, we will need to slowly break it down into Left Hand Side (LHS) and Right Hand Side (RHS).", "From the Right Hand Side (RHS), it shows a simple linear equation formula with the b coefficients and input features. Similar to the Linear Regression, these coefficients are optimized to minimize the cost function.", "The Left Hand Site (LHS), you would see the natural logarithm of odds ratio. p(X) is the positive event/the default class. In the Titanic dataset, this could mean the possibility you survive or in the breast cancer classification, the possibility of cancer.", "This equation will translate into logistic sigmoid function which is the S-shape inverse from the logit function.", "We use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation to optimize the best values for the trained coefficient to minimize the distance of the test predicted to the actual labels.", "Interestingly, the coefficients would also translate to how important is a certain feature to affect the probability of a prediction. For example, in this dataset, you could find that sex have large log regression coefficients compared to fare. This means that sex matters to determine the predictions. A very useful way to propose insights to your manager!", "To tune a good bias-variance tradeoff, Logistic Regression introduces regularization parameter to handle multicolinearity among features, filter noise among signals, and prevent too complex models. It introduces additional information to penalize parameters with extreme weight.", "This is a more descriptive info on L1 and L2 regularization for Logistic Regression.", "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful learning algorithm to maximize the margin among class variables. This margin (alias: support vector) represents the distance of the separating hyperplanes (alias: decision boundary).", "The rationale to have decision boundaries with large margin is to separate positive and negative hyperplanes with adjustable bias-variance proportion. The goal is to separate so that negative samples would fall under negative hyperplane and positive samples would fall under positive hyperplane.", "In 1995, Vladimir Vapnik led the concept of soft-margin classification to add the slack variable to relax the non linearly separable data. This slack variable will control the width and placement of the margin and tune the bias-variance tradeoff. You can find more information in this amazing post by Rishabh", "The advantages of Logistic regression is that it introduces a simpler model and can be implemented more easily. It determines weights of importance for each variable which could be assigned to probability functions for each prediction. Which is very important to discover insights to rating problems such as credit risk scoring. Furthermore logistic regression could be easily updated as new data comes in which is perfect for streaming data.", "However, as Logistic Regression tries to maximize the conditional likelihood of the training data, Logistic Regression is highly prone to outliers. Standardization as co-linearity checks are also fundamental to make sure the features\u2019 weight to not dominate over the others.", "For SVM, on the other hand, is not as prone to outliers as it only cares about the points closest to the decision boundary. It might change the decision boundary depending on the placement of the new positive or negative events.", "Another reason why SVM is highly popular is that it can be made into kernels easily to determine nonlinear classification problems. The idea is to project the data points into higher-dimensional mapping where it is separable. This means, rather than separating 2D features (plane) with a 1D feature (line), you could now separate 3D features (hyper plane) with a 2D feature (plane). The kernels will take data as input then transform it into the required form (linear, non linear, radial, sigmoid, etc).", "In particular, such equivalence holds even if one of the algorithms is random guessing: there are \u201cas many\u201d targets for which any particular learning algorithm gets confused by the data and performs worse than random as for which it performs better. \u2014 David H. Wolpert (No Free Lunch Theorem)", "In the No Free Lunch Theorem, it states that no model works best for every problem. In practice, it is always recommended to compare performances of every learning algorithm and select the best model for the particular problem.", "Overfitting is a problem in machine learning where the model performs well to fit the training data but does not generalize good enough with the test (unseen) data. This will introduce high variance as it introduces too many parameters which make the model more complex.", "On the other hand, underfitting might occur which means that the machine learning model does not capture enough complexity to represent patterns in the training data \u2014 this will also introduce low performance with the test data.", "These are very big problems in each of the model which you should avoid. Therefore, to select if you need to use SVM or Logistic Regression. You would need to ask yourself several questions:", "Remember that there is no perfect model, each of the model is a tool. Meaning that it needs to be properly justified and optimized in accordance to each of the case.", "If you need more examples and better insights of what Logistic Regression and SVM can offer.
