How to do so isn\u2019t always super clear.", "This article is a guide for current and aspiring developers and data scientists. We\u2019ll highlight 10 essential os and shutil commands so you can write scripts to automate interactions with the file system.", "The file system is a bit like a house. Say you\u2019re spring cleaning and you need to move boxes of notebooks from one room to another.", "The boxes are like directories. They hold things. In this case, notebooks.", "The notebooks are like files. You can read and write to them. You can put them in your directory boxes.", "In this guide we\u2019ll look at methods from the os and shutil modules. The os module is the primary Python module for interacting with the operating system. The shutil module also contains high-level file operations. For some reason you make directories with os but move and copy them with shutil. Go figure. \ud83d\ude0f", "In Python 3.4 the pathlib module was added to the standard library to improve working with file paths, and as of 3.6 is plays nicely with the rest of the standard library. The pathlib methods provide some benefits for parsing file paths over the methods we\u2019ll discuss below \u2014 namely pathlib treats paths as objects rather than strings. Although pathlib is handy, it doesn\u2019t have all the lower level functionality we\u2019ll be exploring. Also, you\u2019ll undoubtedly see the os and shutil methods below in code for years to come. So it\u2019s definitely a good idea to be familiar with them.", "I plan to discuss pathlib in a future article, so follow me to make sure you don\u2019t miss it. To learn more about the pathlib module now, see this article and this article.", "A few other things to know before we dig in:", "Now that we\u2019ve got the context out of the way, let\u2019s get to it! Here\u2019s the list of 10 commands you should know.", "The list below follows this pattern:", "Method \u2014 Description \u2014 Equivalent macOS Shell Command", "os.getcwd() returns the current working directory as a string. \ud83d\ude04", "os.listdir() returns the contents of the current working directory as a list of strings. \ud83d\ude04", "os.walk() creates a generator that can return information about the current directory and subdirectories. It works through the directories in the specified starting directory.", "os.walk() returns the following items for each directory it traverses:", "It does this for each directory!", "It\u2019s often useful to use os.walk() with a for loop to iterate over the contents of a directory and its subdirectories. For example, the following code will print all files in the directories and subdirectories of the current working directory.", "That\u2019s how we get info, now let\u2019s look at commands that change the working directory or move, copy, or delete parts of the file system.", "This method changes the current working directory to either the absolute or relative path provided.", "If your code then makes other changes to the file system, it\u2019s a good idea to handle any exceptions raised when using this method with try-except. Otherwise you might be deleting directories or files you don\u2019t want deleted. \ud83d\ude22", "The os.path module has a number of useful methods for common pathname manipulations. You can use it to find information about directory names and parts of directory names. The module also has methods to check whether a file or directory exists.", "os.path.join() is designed to create a path that will work on most any operating system by joining multiple strings into one beautiful file path.\ud83d\ude04", "Here\u2019s the description from the docs:", "Join one or more path components intelligently. The return value is the concatenation of path and any members of *paths with exactly one directory separator (os.sep) following each non-empty part except the last\u2026", "Basically, if you are on a Unix or macOS system, os.path.join() sticks a forward slash (\u201c/\u201d) between each string you provide to create a path. If the operating system needs a \u201c\\\u201d instead, then join knows to use a back slash.", "os.path.join() also provides clear information to other developers that you are creating a path. Definitely use it instead of manual string concatenation to avoid looking like a rookie. \ud83d\ude09", "os.makedirs() makes directories. The mkdir() method also makes directories, but it does not make intermediate directories. So I suggest you use os.makedirs().", "There are many ways to copy files and directories in Python. shutil.copy2() is a good choice because it tries to preserve as much of the source file\u2019s metadata as possible. For more discussion, see this article.", "Use shutil.move() to change a file\u2019s location. It uses copy2 as the default under the hood.", "Sometimes you need to remove a file. os.remove() is your tool.", "shutil.rmtree() removes a directory and all files and directories in it.", "Careful with functions that delete things! You may want to print what will be deleted as a dry run with print(). Then run substitute in your remove function for print() when you\u2019re sure it won\u2019t delete the wrong files. Hat tip to Al Sweigart for that idea in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.", "Here\u2019s the full list one more time.", "The list below follows this pattern: Method\u2014 Description \u2014 Equivalent macOS Shell Command", "Now you\u2019ve seen the basics of interacting with the file system in Python. Try these commands in your IPython interpreter for quick feedback. Then explain them to someone else to solidify your knowledge. You\u2019ll be less sore than if you had moved boxes of notebooks around your house. \ud83c\udfe0 But the exercise would have been good, so now you can hit the gym instead. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09", "If you want to learn about reading and writing from files with Python check out the open function.
