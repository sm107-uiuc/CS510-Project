As of 28th Aug, 2020, there are 68 countries having more confirmed cumulative cases than Australia as illustrated in Fig 1 below.", "We used the following two datasets from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDE) in this study. One dataset contains the number of people affected by COVID-19 world wide, another dataset tracks the imposed measures obtained by HDE. Among the 69 countries including Australia, two were excluded due to absence of measures data, so a total 67 countries with 33 measures were used in this study and the list of measures is:", "The 33 measures are scaled to [0,1] based on the timing of each specific measure used by a country. From the day of the 1st case reported in a country, if a measure was not used, then the measure is recorded as 0. The earlier a measure was introduced by a country, the higher is the value (closer to 1) for that specific measure.", "In order to measure the effectiveness with the timing of each measure that was used by different countries, these countries are broadly categorised into three types:", "To estimate the effectiveness of the measures in relation to the reduction of the daily cases, we used a derived variable \u201creduction percentage\u201d that is computed by finding the difference from the peak and the valley based on a 30-day rolling average of daily curves. The 30-day rolling range was chosen to avoid too many local max and local min. For type A countries, the reduction percentage is 0 because they have not reached their peak yet in the first curve. For type B, the reduction percentage is calculated based on the reduction from the peak value to the latest day because they have not started their second curve yet. For example, it is calculated as 90% for Afghanistan. With type C countries that are experiencing their second wave, the reduction percentage is the reduction from the first peak to the first lowest valley before the second wave. Given that measures can be stopped and re-imposed, it is difficult to incorporate the exact dates of withdrawing and re-imposing measures. Hence we only used the reduction value related to the first wave. Australia has a 95% reduction percentage even though it is in the process of flattening second wave.", "We used three regression algorithms to measure the features importance with Linear regression as the baseline. The matrix is composed with all countries listed in this study and 33 measures with 1 target variable that is the reduction percentage as described above. The 3 algorithms used are:", "Both XGBoost with hyperparameters tuning and LightGBM with default parameters) produced very similar results. The data set is split into train (80%) and test data (20%) and test error greater than train error indicates an over-fitting. Minimum Absolute Error (MAE) is used to evaluate the model performance in both training and testing sets. The results are shown in Table 1 below.", "Out of 33 measures, we bagged the features importance with a positive F-score based on the average from XGBoost and LightGBM. The features importance ranked from high to low are shown in Fig 3 below.", "Based on the results from our bagged model, it is clear that:", "is ranked first indicating as the most effective measure in controlling the spread of infection. This is in line with many epidemiologists\u2019 view that stopping international flights especially from the epicentre early on is crucial in controlling the COVID-19. This measure has been effectively used by many countries with success.", "are ranked as second. A good public healthcare system can help to detect and support recovery of the infected patients; and masks wearing in public is effective against spreading the disease. This is evident in most of the Asian countries which have controlled the COVID-19 spread.", "come third on the list in terms of effectiveness. This verifies that isolation and contact tracing are extremely important to contain the disease in the community, and many countries have seen the evidence in the result of suppression of the curve.", "Interestingly measures such as full lock down, border closure, school closure & testing policy are not ranked as highly effective as the measures discussed above. To summarise our study with the data from 67 countries with 33 different types of measures, we find that:", "\u201cinternational flights, wearing masks and quarantine are the most effective measures\u201d", "Feel free to access the GitHub repo, and we welcome your feedback and comments.", "Your home for data science.
