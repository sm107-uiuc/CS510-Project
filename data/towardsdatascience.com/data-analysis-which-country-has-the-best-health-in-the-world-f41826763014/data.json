In fact, the data were compiled by the the University of Gothenburg\u2019s Quality of Government Institute. It\u2019s like a meta-repository of datasets from the World Health Organization, the UN, and many other independent social science researchers broken down into various themes. We\u2019ll focus on public health.", "So, let\u2019s see if we can use the QoG dataset to answer the following question:", "What is the overall best country for living a relatively long, healthy, and happy life?", "I\u2019ve decided to rate each country on 11 dimensions (based on the availability of such data in the QoG dataset). The 11 dimensions are:", "Notice that for some measures, low scores are good and for others high scores are good. We will take care of this issue in the ranking section later on.", "First we read in the data and select our 11 variables. After omitting missing values, we end up with a sample of 39 countries from all over the globe.", "Sampling of what our data look like:", "Getting the obesity data will require us to scrape the HTML tables from the renewbariatrics website. We\u2019ll use the super easy-to-use Rvest package to do that.", "Some tedious but necessary changes we need to make in order to keep our original countries. The scraped table used slightly different names for the countries.", "Now the tricky part will be matching the names with our existing names. Because we\u2019ve made sure to change names to make them identical, we shouldn\u2019t lose any observations (I hope). Let\u2019s try an inner_join (mutating join) to only keep rows that have matches", "OK, everything looks good: no NAs or crazy values. We can rerun our analysis using this new obesity dimension now.", "Which 39 countries did we end up with?", "Finally we are ready to re-run our analysis with these corrected names and the new obesity variable.", "This is super interesting and it\u2019s worth spending some time examining.", "There are plenty more interesting correlations!", "If you\u2019re not familiar with perceptual maps, I suggest the very good book by Chris Chapman and Elea Feit called \u201cR for Marketing Research and Analytics.\u201d Basically we will run PCA on the 10 dimensions, reduce to two dimensions, then visualize the groupings of the countries on the two dimensions.", "The summary() function is very useful in deciding how many PCs to keep. Here we can see that 5 PCs cover about 90% of the variance in our original 10 variables. We\u2019ll only keep the first two that explain 60% of variance.", "If you\u2019re more of a visual person, you can use a screeplot to find the \u201celbow\u201d where the marginal variance captured by the next PC seems to drop.", "If I were going to use this in a predictive model I might decide to keep 4\u20135 PCs, but here we will only keep the first two for easy visualization.", "To visualize the results, we use the biplot() function. FYI South Africa is \u201cZAF.\u201d", "This biplot contains a ton of information and its interpretation can be tricky. Let\u2019s break it down.", "First notice that the x/y axes are PC1 and PC2, which cumulatively explain about 60% of the variation in the original variables. So already we know there is more to this story than just these two PC scores- about 40% of the story is left untold.", "Second, the red arrows (vectors) have both a magnitude and an angle. The angle of these arrows relative to the x/y axes show you the degree to which these original variables are being \u201ccaptured\u201d by the PCs. So nearly vertical lines are well captured by PC2 (HIV and Tuberculosis rates), while PC1 seems to be capturing Infant mortality, public services, water sanitation and the Human Development Index.", "The angles between the two original variables (red lines) represents the direction of correlation. So infant mortality and public services are very positively correlated, while HIV rates and Tobacco use are negatively correlated. These interpretations should match our results from the correlation matrix above. Finally, and this one I\u2019m not sure about, but the length of the arrows represents the standard deviation in the original variables. So if you squared the length you\u2019d represent that variable\u2019s variance.", "Biplots are subtle creatures. If you don\u2019t believe me, check out some of the StackOverflow discussions about them. For now, we\u2019ll focus on just the most practical implications and pitfalls.", "First, the positioning of the countries on the biplot is relative and so changing the number of variables and/or adding/removing countries will affect the relationships among them.", "Second, remember I mentioned that PC1 & PC2 only account for about 60% of the variance of all original variables. This means there may be other relationships between countries that are not accounted for in this 60% of variance. In short, there is more to the story than what you see in this biplot.", "\u201cWhen we look at PC1 and PC2 scores we are looking at the \u2018largest magnitude similarities,\u2019 which could hide other, smaller differences in the other PCs.\u201d", "With that proviso, let\u2019s quickly review what the biplot tells us.", "The geographic clustering of countries suggests that PCA is working pretty well to figure out how different countries are similar and different. Paradoxically, any kind of statistical learning procedure should conform (roughly) to our expectations, but if it were 100% as we expected, we wouldn\u2019t be learning anything. So ideally our analysis would match our intuition, but we hold out hope that there are a few wild cards thrown at us that force us to re-evaluate our assumptions-or even recheck our data to make sure they\u2019re correct. That\u2019s the beauty of data-driven methods: they can present us with a new perspective on a topic we thought we understood.", "You can use the choices=c(3,4) to remake the plot with PC3 and 4 as the axes. Just for fun we\u2019ll try it.", "Because up to 5 PCs explain 90% of variance, it might be worthwhile to check this plot out as well. Think of this plot as showing how PC3 and 4 \u201cSoaked up\u201d the remaining variance not captured by PC1 and 2.", "Now we see that PC3 represents different variables (happiness) and PC4 captures a lot of variation in PM 2.5 and Obesity rates. Interestingly, by these measures, now Middle Eastern countries are grouped together by their higher obesity rates and low alcohol consumption.", "As I mentioned earlier, this is a super complex question, but just for fun let\u2019s see what we can come up with. Here\u2019s the thinking behind what follows. We will rank countries by their scores on each variable and the compute which countries has the overall lowest (best) rank on all 11 dimensions. We will crown that country as \u201cthe best for health.\u201d But one problem we will have is that some dimensions have high scores for \u201cgood\u201d and others have low scores for \u201cgood.\u201d", "Let\u2019s try some visualizations on these data to get a better feel. Visualizing ranked data is not something I do often, so I welcome any feedback on which methods are most suited for displaying these data.", "I kept the trace on there because it shows you where the colors fall (column-wise) relative to the average. For example, for HIV rates, you can see whitish colors mean higher scores and thus the trace pops out to the right. Dark red colors move the trace left. You can see that Jordan has the best ranking for HIV prevalence.", "You can also see a big group of European countries that are dark red on all the basic life statistics, but do not do well on tobacco use or alcohol consumption\u2013two strong predictors of early mortality.", "The USA is white for \u201cperc_obese\u201d due to their number 1 ranking out of the 39 countries.", "Final Ranks from best to worst:", "So there you have it, according to our criteria the top 5 countries for \u201chealth\u201d (as defined by yours truly) are, in order:", "Singapore, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands.", "The USA dropped from the 5th spot to the 8th spot when obesity rates were factored in.", "The last 5 countries are, in order:", "Ukraine, Russia, Nigeria, India, and South Africa.", "Wow, sorry my South African friends. If I had to guess why it\u2019s the HIV/Tuberculosis rates. Perhaps the situation has improved in recent years, as these data are several years old. Good news for Pakistan though, it is now ranked 34th out of 39 when obesity data were added. Russia took its spot.", "I\u2019d say these results match up pretty well with expectation, though I did not expect South Africa to fare so poorly. I think one key takeaway here is that countries that have some very poor populations (India and South Africa) are disproportionately weighed down by these inequalities. There are certainly parts of these countries that are every bit as modern (or more so) than countries in our top 10. However on the whole, those top 10 countries have a base-line level of public services/infrastructure/health care that the bottom 10 countries do not have.", "My first idea was to use something like a parallel coordinate plot. But with 39 countries it is going to be ugly.", "Yes, as I suspected it\u2019s chaos with 39 countries. But you can still see some useful relationships (denoted by the depth of the connecting lines between variables). For example, you can see that countries scoring well on obesity tend to also have high HIV/Tuberculosis rates. And countries that have bad water sanitation seem to have better air quality. Not a trade-off I\u2019d like to make, but an interesting observation nonetheless.", "My other idea was to facet by variable type and color by score and look for the countries with the smallest bars (indicating low=good ranks). I think this is better.", "Don\u2019t mind the gargantuan chunk of code. But basically in order to do this you have to reshape the data into \u201clong\u201d form so you can facet by variable. If you haven\u2019t mastered this technique, it is well worth your time doing so. Use the gather() function from the tidyverse library.", "So there we go. We can see South Africa did poorly on water, public services, human development, HIV and tuberculosis, which contributed to its position as dead last.", "Meanwhile, Singapore is top of the list in nearly every category except Tuberculosis. The ranks hide the fact that in absolute numbers, the cases per 100,000 in Singapore are around 50\u201360 vs. in the USA where they are 2.9. Not a huge absolute difference but a huge relative one.", "Most of the European countries would have come out clearly on top had their alcohol and tobacco consumption levels been lower. And to the Germans, I say blame your good-but-not-great showing on all that damned Hefeweizen and the hipsters in Berlin who roll their cigs on the U-Bahn.
