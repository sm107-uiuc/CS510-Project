Since its inception, it has virtually rewritten the book on event streaming and has catalyzed the adoption of the now household design patterns \u2014 microservices, event-sourcing, and CQRS.", "Being such a godsend, it almost gets away with its notorious lack of tooling. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a developer who hasn\u2019t at one time looked at the built-in CLI tools, cupped their face and uttered: \u201cIs this it? Are you kidding me?\u201d", "With the popularity of Kafka, it\u2019s no surprise that several commercial vendors have jumped on the opportunity to monetize Kafka\u2019s apparent lack of tooling by offering their own. Kafka Tool, Landoop, and KaDeck are some examples, but they\u2019re all for personal use only unless you\u2019re willing to pay. (And it\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t, au contraire, but that\u2019s rather beside the point.) Any non-trivial use in a commercial setting would be a violation of their licensing terms. It\u2019s one thing using them at home for tutorials or personal projects; when you\u2019re using a commercial tool without the appropriate license, you are putting your employer at risk of litigation and playing Russian Roulette with your career.", "When it comes to Kafka topic viewers and web UIs, the go-to open-source tool is Kafdrop. With 800K Docker pulls at the time of writing, there aren\u2019t many Kafka tools that have enjoyed this level of adoption. And there\u2019s a reason behind that: Kafdrop does an amazing job of filling the apparent gaps in the observability tooling of Kafka, solving problems that the community has been pointing out for too long.", "Kafdrop is an Apache 2.0 licensed project, like Apache Kafka itself. So it\u2019s won\u2019t cost you a penny. If you haven\u2019t used it yet, you probably ought to. So let\u2019s take a deeper look.", "The Kafdrop web UI project is hosted on GitHub:", "There\u2019s a couple of options at your disposal. You could show a little bravery by cloning the repository and building from source. It\u2019s a Java (JDK 11) Spring Boot project, and you can build it with a single Maven command, providing you have the JDK installed. If you want to go down this path, the repo\u2019s README.md file will guide you through the steps. For now, let's take the easy way \u2014 Docker. (I sure would.)", "Docker images are hosted on DockerHub. Images are tagged with the Kafdrop release number. The latest tag points to the latest stable release.", "To launch the container in the foreground, run the following command:", "The KAFKA_BROKERCONNECT environment variable must be set to the bootstrap list of brokers.", "That\u2019s it. We should be up and running. Once it starts, you can launch the Kafka web UI by navigating to localhost:9000.", "Note: The above example assumes an authenticated connection over a plaintext TCP socket. If your cluster is configured to use authentication and/or transport-level encryption, consult the README.md for connection options. It's actually surprisingly easy to configure Kafdrop for a SASL/SSL locked-down cluster.", "Don\u2019t have a Kafka broker running? No worries. Just use the following docker-compose.yaml file to bring up a Kafka + Kafdrop stack:", "Now launch the stack with docker-compose up. Once started, browse to localhost:9000.", "The Cluster Overview screen is the landing page of the web UI.", "You get to see the overall layout of the cluster \u2014 the individual brokers that make it up, their addresses and some key broker stats \u2014 whether they are a controller and the number of partitions each broker owns. The latter is quite important \u2014 as your cluster size and the number of topics (and therefore partitions) grows, you generally want to see an approximately level distribution of partitions across the cluster.", "Next is the Topics List, which in most cases is what you\u2019re really here for. Any reasonably-sized microservices-based ecosystem might have hundreds, if not thousands of topics. As you\u2019d expect, the list is searchable. The stats displayed alongside each topic are fairly ho-hum. The one worth noting is the under-replicated column. Essentially, it\u2019s telling us the number of partition replicas that have fallen behind the primary. Zero is a good figure. Anything else is indicative of either a broker or a network issue that requires immediate attention.", "Note: Kafdrop is a discovery exploration tool; it is not a real-time monitoring tool. You should instrument your brokers and raise alerts when things go awry.", "Click on a topic on the list to get to the Topic Overview screen.", "The screen is subdivided into four sections.", "On the top-left, there is a summary of the topic stats \u2014 a handy view, not dissimilar to what you would have seen in the cluster overview.", "On the top-right, you can view the custom configuration. In the example above, the topic runs a stock-standard config, so there\u2019s nothing to see. Had the configuration been overridden, you\u2019d see a set of custom values like in the example below.", "The bottom-left section enumerates over the partitions. The partition indexes are links \u2014 clicking through will reveal the first 100 messages in the topic.", "There are several interesting parameters displayed in this section:", "The consumers\u2019 section on the bottom-right lists the consumer group names as well as their aggregate lag (the sum of all individual partition lags).", "Clicking on the consumer group on the Topic Overview gets you into the Consumer View. This screen provides a comprehensive breakdown of a single consumer group.", "The view is sectioned by topic. For each topic, a separate table lists the underlying partitions. Against each partition, we see the committed offset, which we can compare against the first and last offsets to see how our consumer is tracking. Conveniently, Kafdrop displays the computed lag for each partition, which is aggregated at the footer of each topic table.", "Note: Some amount of lag is unavoidable. For every message published, there will invariably be a quantum of time between the point of publishing and the point of consumption. In Kafka, this period is usually in the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds, depending on both the producer and consumer client options, network configuration, broker I/O capabilities, the size of the pagecache and a myriad of other factors. What you need to look out for is growing lag \u2014 suggesting that the consumer is either unable to keep up or has stalled altogether. In the latter case, you\u2019ll also notice that the lag isn\u2019t being depleted even when the producer is idling. This is when you\u2019ll need to ALT-TAB away from Kafdrop into your favourite debugger.", "The Message View screen is the coveted topic viewer that has in all likelihood brought you here. You can get to the message view in one of two ways:", "It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect \u2014 a chronologically-ordered list of messages (or records, in Kafka parlance) for a chosen partition.", "Each entry conveniently displays the offset, the record key (if one is set), the timestamp of publication, and any headers that may have been appended by the producer.", "There\u2019s another little trick up Kafdrop\u2019s sleeve. If the message happens to be a valid JSON document, the topic viewer can nicely format it. Click on the green arrow on the left of the message to expand it.", "The more you use Kafka, the more you come to discover and appreciate its true potential \u2014 not just as a versatile event streaming platform, but as a general-purpose messaging middleware that lets you assemble complex business systems from asynchronous, loosely coupled services.", "You\u2019ll invariably experience the frustrations that are to be expected from a technology that has only recently entered the mainstream, by comparison with the more mature MQ brokers of yore. What\u2019s reassuring is that the Open Source community hasn\u2019t stood still, producing an evolving ecosystem, complete with the documentation and tooling necessary for us to get on with our jobs. The least we can do in return is raise a pull request once in a while or maybe answer a StackOverflow question or three.", "Was this article useful to you?
