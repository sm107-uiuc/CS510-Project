IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The league has 8 teams representing 8 different Indian cities or states. It enjoys tremendous popularity and the brand value of the IPL in 2019 was estimated to be \u20b9475 billion (US$6.7 billion). So let\u2019s analyze IPL through stats.", "To have a detailed understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), I recommend you to visit my blog:", "Let\u2019s start by reading the csv file to Pandas DataFrame.", "The following inferences can be made from the describe() method:", "Let\u2019s view the unique values of each column to help us understand the dataset better.", "The dataset has 18 columns. Let\u2019s get acquainted with the columns.", "A mere glance of the DataFrame through its columns indicates the presence of NaN values in the \u2018umpire3\u2019 column. Let\u2019s see the count of NaN values in the column.", "It\u2019s imperative to know the count of NaN values for each column before we proceed further.", "The column \u2018umpire3\u2019 has a significant number of NaN values. As the off-field umpire parameter is insignificant, we can drop this column. The other columns that have Nan values are of type object(Pandas equivalent of Python String data type) and are very few in number(<=7).", "Now that our data set has been cleaned up, it\u2019s time to do the in-depth analysis and visualization.", "Let\u2019s begin by importingmatplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.", "To know more about matplotlib.rcParams, kindly visit my blog:", "Each IPL season has a fair share of excitement and adulation. No team other than Chennai Super Kings(in 2010 and 2011) was able to win the IPL trophy in succession. That is a testimony to the unpredictability of IPL.", "Let\u2019s analyze the team with the most wins in each season.", "The number of wins is a discrete value. Hence, we will plot a bar chart(barplot in Seaborn).", "From the barplot, we can easily make inferences regarding the year in which a particular team has scored the maximum wins(and also the number of wins).", "In a game of sports, every team competes for victory. Hence, the team that has registered the most number of victories is the most successful.", "Winning matters the most in a competitive league match. If a player makes the most significant contribution to his team\u2019s victory, then he\u2019s chosen as the player_of_match. The player who has won the player_of_match title on most occasions is the most valuable player.", "Let\u2019s try to find answers to the questions that will linger in an IPL fan\u2019s mind. In Part I, we are dealing with some very basic questions. In Part II, we will delve deeper.", "We have figured out the top ten players of IPL using the \u2018Player of the Match\u2019 title as the yardstick. It is interesting to note that the top two players \u2014 Chris Gayle and AB de Villers have never won an IPL. Of the top ten players, 6 players(RG Sharma, MS Dhoni, DA Warner, SR Watson, SK Raina, and G Gambhir) have won the IPL. It exemplifies the importance of the presence of the most valuable player(s) in a team.", "S. Ravi(Sundaram Ravi) has officiated the most number of IPL matches on-field, followed by former Sri Lankan international cricketer HDPK Dharmasena.", "Nothing succeeds like success. In a game of cricket, winning is everything. We have narrowed down on the list of teams that made the most number of wins in each season. The DataFrame win_per_season_df gives the required information. Mumbai Indians has secured the most wins in four seasons(2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019). Mumbai Indians won the IPL trophy in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019.", "Mumbai Indians secured the most number of wins(109) in IPL, followed by Chennai Super Kings.", "Of all the IPL matches played till 2019, Mumbai Indians has emerged victorious in the most number of games. They have secured most wins in four seasons and have won four IPL trophies so far. Hence Mumbai Indians is the most successful team in IPL.", "The city of Mumbai has hosted the maximum number of IPL matches.", "The probability of winning when the team had won the toss is 52%. So winning toss gives a slight edge over the opponent. However, it would be naive to term winning the toss as a greater advantage as there were 363 instances when the team losing the toss has won the game.", "The greatest victory in IPL on defending a total is for Mumbai Indians when they defeated Delhi Daredevils by 146 runs on 06 May 2017 at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium, Delhi.", "Let\u2019s summarize the important observations we made during Exploratory Data Analysis:", "Your home for data science.
