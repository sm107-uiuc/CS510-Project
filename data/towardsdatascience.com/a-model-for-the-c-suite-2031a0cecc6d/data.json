When a great visualization is used in a presentation it has a magnetic pull on the group; it generates discussion and deep study (I\u2019d count focus on a picture lasting more than 30 seconds or so as deep study in a typical meeting). In the right context some charts serve as complete, stand-alone executive summaries.", "Network models offer this kind of clear and compelling visualization, making them very well suited for the executive audience. But these models are far more than a pretty picture. They are generative models allowing for simulation and inference with efficient automated model discovery methods. Under generally accepted causality frameworks network models estimate causal effects. Any one of those attributes makes for an analytics tool worth using, but having all three of them in one method is truly exceptional", "To demonstrate the power of network models, this article walks through a simple network model of Intel\u2019s financials. We consider the link between net revenue and R&D and advertising expenses as our main focus.", "Let\u2019s start with the simple network below.", "With no coaching at all, I\u2019m willing to bet you immediately understand the key points of the picture to the left: each named dot (\u2018node\u2019) is a quantity, the arrows (\u2018edges\u2019) indicate relationships between those quantities, and you probably guessed that the arrows point from cause to effect.", "These nodes are a minimal skeleton of Intel\u2019s financial reporting plus the global retail sales (in units) for one of the company\u2019s key markets. Most labels are self explanatory, but g&A is likely not. It is computed from the reported Advertising, General & Administrative expense line item, with advertising spend subtracted to keep ad spend separate from the other two. The Intel data here is sourced from the 28 annual10-K filings found on SEC.gov covering 1992 to 2019. The global PC sales for the same years were found on wikipedia and ars technica. All values are in millions, and dollar amounts have been adjusted for inflation to the value of the dollar in 2000.", "In the network, variables are tagged _0 to indicate that all of these represent the same time step; i.e. this network represents relationships between values in the same year.", "The network structure is learned from the data by a simple hill climbing algorithm with restarts and some trimming, using the AIC as an optimization metric. I\u2019ve done this using R\u2019s bnlearn package\u2019s tabu() function. The method is fast (and applies well to larger networks) but does not guarantee a true global optimum is found. But this can work to our advantage, leaving us room to apply business knowledge and still obtain a model no worse than the \u2018optimal\u2019 one.", "The heart of a network model is showing relationships between variables \u2014 even very complex relationships. If a variable is a controllable quantity (e.g. ad spend) then the network shows what quantities will be impacted by changing the controllable quantity. If no path exists between two nodes in the network (not the case for any pair of nodes in our network) then the two quantities are independent of each other, both practically (i.e. we cannot change one to influence the other) and probabilistically (i.e. the distribution of one conditioned on the other is the same as the distribution first quantities distribution). If two nodes do have a path between them there is evidence that information about one node has implications for the other.", "In our example network, we can see that R&D expenses drive all the other values except advertising and that advertising drives both net revenue and total PC sales. While that\u2019s interesting in and of itself, I think we would all agree that this is expected. Maybe a harder question is are there lasting (i.e. multi-year) effects of ad and research expenses?", "The model is easily extended to address this; we simply add nodes to cover previous years\u2019 values. I\u2019ll add two more years to our model and see what results. In the visualization below a suffix of \u201c_-1\u201d implies a variable value 1 year before the \u201c_0\u201d value.", "As you explore the multi-year relationships (the link in the caption will get you to an interactive plot that might help make relationships more viewable) you\u2019ll see that there are persistent effects from last year\u2019s R&D and indirectly R&D from two years ago (via the previous years\u2019 net revenue).", "We also see that the relationships within a year aren\u2019t the same in each layer \u2014 which feels problematic. For example, if the year is 2018, the current ad spend influences net revenue. But once the current year is 2019, the 2018 spend no longer influenced 2018 net revenue?", "Frankly, that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. And because I promised a model that immediately made sense, we need to help the structure learning algorithm with some expert advice. I propose to keep the within-year relationship in all years the same as the initial model and let the between year relationships be identified algorithmically. This is simple to do by passing the edges of the single year network as a whitelist dataframe to bnlearn\u2019s structure finding functions.", "Now we see the original relationships conserved. We also see more connections between the years (each layer here is one year). More arrows mean more parameters, so it is important to note that the AIC of this modified model is very close to auto-magically learned model\u2019s AIC.", "So this \u2018proves\u2019 that R&D and advertising expenditures have lasting business impact. Which arms executives of those functions to argue that cutting budgets this year will leave the business hampered for years to come.", "Presumably, any executive team out to make a name for itself will immediately follow-up with \u201c\u2018how much will the business be hampered if we make the cuts anyway?\u201d Fortunately, our network model allows for inference and simulation by simply setting the values of those decision nodes, our (advertising and R&D budgets), and sampling the resulting distribution of the outcome of interest (say, net revenue).", "If all relevant variables are accounted for in the model, the difference in the expected value of the outcome as the value of the decision node varies is the causal impact of varying the decision. We can easily find the historical causal impact of R&D and ad spends by comparing the expected value of net revenue in 2019 with actual spend levels in the last 3 years to the expected value of net revenue with 0 spend for all 3 of those years.", "Well, this is certainly an unexpected result! A quick investigation shows that the within-year advertising coefficients are positive (as expected) but the between-year advertising coefficients are always negative. I suppose we could rationalize this by saying that ads driving sales this year are stealing from sales in the next year. . .but we can also note that the ad spend in year 0 is highly correlated to the spends in year -1 and year -2. This indicates the estimates for present and past ad spends onto a given net revenue node are subject to the ill effects of collinearity.", "Given the high correlation, and the unreasonable estimates, we can simply ban previous years\u2019 advertising from having a direct impact on current net revenue. This still leaves room for an indirect influence through, e.g., previous years net revenue. The final network is charted below.", "The AIC is lower than our last model, so we haven\u2019t destroyed our model by removing the offending edges!", "Now we can apply the same \u2018turn it off\u2019 approach as before to get the causal impact of R&D and advertising effect on net revenue. This model shows positive impacts all around, aligning with common sense and giving the CMO some relief. Interestingly, R&D is now showing a much stronger positive impact on revenue than before. So everyone is going to prefer this model!", "To wrap up, let\u2019s note that the models presented here are intentionally simple and somewhat limited by the publicly available data used in the example.", "For convenience, we have used bnlearn\u2019s inbuilt fitting functions which limits continuous variables to gaussian distributions. This is not a required assumption for network models. More complex networks could have different distributions by node (bnlearn can handle this by discretizing continous variables and other software can directly model different distributions). Additionally (but not-additively), the relationships between the nodes could be non-linear whereas in these examples each nodes mean is a linear combination of its parents\u2019 means.", "From the analytics side, it is hard to swallow looking for a global impact of aggregate R&D spend (maybe capex vs working spend should be split out? Perhaps large initiatives should be modeled separately with different possible durations of effect?) or advertising spend (surely B2B and direct to consumer campaigns have potentially different effects over time?). Perhaps we need more years in the network to account for very long term effects? And we almost certainly should add more external factors (Competitor ad spend? Server sales? Merge and Acquisition activity in computer manufacturers?) to the model before claiming we had included all relevant variables influencing net revenue.", "But our simplified example serves to demonstrate the flexbility and utility of graph models. And along the way it highlights how fundamental data issues like collinearity are fundamental because they matter no matter the model being built.", "I hope I have also convinced you of the value of the network diagram itself. It is impossible to over-emphasize how potent it is for gaining an audience\u2019s alignment with a model. Because the audience can really see the model, they almost immediately feel comfortable reasoning with it.", "Imagine a final presentation where most of the conversation is about your recommendations and not what your model is \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that be a nice change of pace?", "I\u2019ll write a how-to-code-it companion article to this one and future articles on other methods; follow me here on medium for updates.", "Your home for data science.
