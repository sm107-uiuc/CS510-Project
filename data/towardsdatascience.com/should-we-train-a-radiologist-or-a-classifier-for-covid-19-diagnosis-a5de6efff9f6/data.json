The performance of this classifier is reported to be similar to experienced thoracic radiologists.", "A lot of works have been published on similar topics, but the authors claimed that DeepCOVID-XR was trained on \u201cthe largest clinical dataset of chest radiographs from the COVID-19 era\u201d.", "As a data scientist, let me briefly go over what we should learn from DeepCOVID-XR in terms of constructing a classifier.", "Data and algorithms to a classification problem are food and cutlery to a picky gastronome, respectively.", "No matter how gorgeous your cutlery is, you cannot satisfy the person without good food.", "One of the most important features of good data is the target value in your project, such as the true labels of the samples in training the classifier.", "The data used to train DeepCOVID-XR are labeled \u201cindependently\u201d, which come from any of the following resources: real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), international classification of diseases (ICD-10), and electronic health record (EHR).", "We know that none of RT-PCR, ICD-10, or EHR could be 100% correct on the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the key is that these records are independent of the function of the classifier (to diagnose COVID-19 based on the radiographs). For example, it will be problematic if the classifier uses the diagnosis of the expert radiologists based on the radiographs as the true labels in the training process.", "In sum, to get true labels (independently from the task) is very important to the construction of a classifier.", "Expanding the structure of the neural network, tuning the hyperparameters, or even changing to a more complex model may help capture more detailed features from the data. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee better performance on the test set.", "One of the most practical ways to gain better values on performance is to use the ensemble of models.", "DeepCOVID-XR is constructed with a weighted ensemble of six different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (including DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, Inception- ResNetV2, Xception, and EfficientNet-B2).", "These used CNNs were pre-trained on chest radiographs in order to \u201cunderstand\u201d the features of chest X-ray images and then fine-tuned on the COVID-19 dataset.", "One of the assumptions of using the ensemble model is that each model is good/bad at a specific aspect of feature capturing. The ensemble of these individual models tries to eliminate the obvious shortcomings of each one of them.", "For some machine learning practitioners, you may find the random forest model, in general, could gain better performance than models (like logistic regression, SVM, etc..) on the tabular data for most of the time. The random forest model itself is an ensemble of decision trees.", "Each decision tree with limited depth and a limited number of features (defined by the hyperparameters) could be bad at or totally ignore some features of the data, which could be addressed by the ensemble of a large number of such trees.", "Similarly, DeepCOVID-XR, as a weighted ensemble of CNNs, was shown to outperform each CNN by itself.", "Of course, we are chasing a higher number in performance when developing algorithms. But we do need to keep in mind that the ceiling of the performance is already defined by the task itself.", "Chest radiographs can never be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19, so we should not expect an AI algorithm is fancy enough to do the diagnosis on its own. Here, the task, \u201cto diagnose COVID-19 by chest radiographs\u201d, itself is the ceiling of all AI programs to do the job.", "This type of ceilings is everywhere in the application field of AI. The intelligence is not really based on a process of thinking, but on the task that it is trained to do and on the data it is fed. Therefore, sometimes I would rather trust biologists more on generating real artificial intelligence in the future.", "Yes, it only takes 2\u20133 hrs to train a classifier (with good computational resources), which is much shorter than that of a radiologist. However, it\u2019s neither easy for AI to set up new references when migrating across populations (eg. radiographs from different sources) nor easy to integrate information from outside the images.", "In sum, trained classifiers are never as easy as trained radiologists to be implemented clinically.", "The author has no personal or professional relationship with the research team who developed DeepCOVID-XR. The entire post only represents the author\u2019s own opinions on the related research field, which should not be taken as solid scientific statements.", "Wehbe, Ramsey M., et al. \u201cDeepCOVID-XR: An Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Detect COVID-19 on Chest Radiographs Trained and Tested on a Large US Clinical Dataset.\u201d Radiology (2020): 203511.", "Weinstock, Michael B., et al. \u201cChest x-ray findings in 636 ambulatory patients with COVID-19 presenting to an urgent care center: a normal chest x-ray is no guarantee.\u201d J Urgent Care Med 14.7 (2020): 13\u20138.", "Huang, Gao, et al. \u201cDensely connected convolutional networks.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2017.", "He, Kaiming, et al. \u201cDeep residual learning for image recognition.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2016.", "Szegedy, Christian, et al. \u201cRethinking the inception architecture for computer vision.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2016.", "Szegedy, Christian, et al. \u201cInception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on learning.\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.072", "Chollet, Fran\u00e7ois. \u201cXception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2017.", "Your home for data science.
