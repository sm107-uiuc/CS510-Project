In reality, statisticians use multivariate data, meaning many variables.", "Covariance is a measure of association between two (or more) random variables.", "As the name \u2018co + variance\u2019 implies, it is like the variance, but applied to a comparison of two variables \u2014 in place of the sum of squares, we have a sum of cross-products.While Variance tells us how a single variable varies from the mean; Covariance tells us how two variables vary from each other. As such it\u2019s fair to say:", "Covariance is measuring the Variance between two variables.", "Covariance can be negative or positive (or zero obviously): A positive value means that the two variables tend to vary in the same direction (i.e. if one increases, then the other one increases too), a negative value means that they vary in opposite directions (i.e. if one increases, then the other one decreases), and zero means that they don\u2019t vary together.", "The formula might be hard to interpret, but it is more important to understand what it means:", "If we think that the dataset of a random variable is represented as a vector, then in the previous example, we have two vectors for experience and income. Here are the steps we need to follow:", "On the 2nd step, we effectively measure the angle between these two vectors, so if they are close to each other, it means that these variables are tightly coupled.", "It is important to note that while the Covariance does measure the directional relationship between two variables, it does not show the strength of the relationship between them.", "In practice, the biggest problem with this metric is that it depends on the units used. For example, if we were to convert the years of experience into months of experience, then the Covariance would be 12 times larger!", "This is where Correlation comes in!", "The Correlation is one of the most common metrics in Statistics that describes the degree of relationship between two random variables. It is considered to be the normalised version of the Covariance. Let\u2019s see why\u2026", "The Correlation (represented by the Greek letter \u03c1 \u2014 rho) can be expressed using this formula:", "The correlation is bounded between -1 and 1. Like the Covariance, the sign of the Correlation indicates the direction of the relationship: positive means that random variables move together, negative means that random variables move in different directions.", "The endpoints (i.e. 1 and -1) indicate that there is a perfect relationship between the two variables. For instance, the relationship between meters and centimetres is always that 1m corresponds to 100cm. If we plot this relationship it will be a perfect line, and therefore the Correlation is 1.", "Please note that a perfect relationship is pretty rare in real life data, since two random variables don\u2019t usually map to each other by a constant factor.", "A Correlation of 0 means that there is no linear relationship between the two variables. There might be a x = y\u00b2 relationship.", "The Correlation does not only indicate the direction of the relationship but also its strength, (depending on how big the absolute value is) as it is unitless: Since we divided the Covariance by the Standard Deviation, the units were cancelled out.", "Finally, we need to remember that \u2018Correlation does not imply Causation\u2019: a high correlation between two random variables just means that they are associated with each other, but their relationship is not necessarily causal in nature. The only way to prove causation is with controlled experiments, where we eliminate outside variables and isolate the effects of the two variables in question.", "All done! We have learnt how to use Covariance and Correlation to measure whether two different attributes in our dataset are related in a linear fashion to each other and why Correlation is usually preferred, since it is unitless.", "Thanks for reading!
