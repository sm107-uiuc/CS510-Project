Let\u2019s look at 5 useful things one needs to know to get started with RL.", "Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.", "Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative behavior.", "As compared to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is different in terms of goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, in the case of reinforcement learning the goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. The figure below illustrates the action-reward feedback loop of a generic RL model.", "Some key terms that describe the basic elements of an RL problem are:", "An RL problem can be best explained through games. Let\u2019s take the game of PacMan where the goal of the agent(PacMan) is to eat the food in the grid while avoiding the ghosts on its way. In this case, the grid world is the interactive environment for the agent where it acts. Agent receives a reward for eating food and punishment if it gets killed by the ghost (loses the game). The states are the location of the agent in the grid world and the total cumulative reward is the agent winning the game.", "In order to build an optimal policy, the agent faces the dilemma of exploring new states while maximizing its overall reward at the same time. This is called Exploration vs Exploitation trade-off. To balance both, the best overall strategy may involve short term sacrifices. Therefore, the agent should collect enough information to make the best overall decision in the future.", "Markov Decision Processes(MDPs) are mathematical frameworks to describe an environment in RL and almost all RL problems can be formulated using MDPs. An MDP consists of a set of finite environment states S, a set of possible actions A(s) in each state, a real valued reward function R(s) and a transition model P(s\u2019, s | a). However, real world environments are more likely to lack any prior knowledge of environment dynamics. Model-free RL methods come handy in such cases.", "Q-learning is a commonly used model-free approach which can be used for building a self-playing PacMan agent. It revolves around the notion of updating Q values which denotes value of performing action a in state s. The following value update rule is the core of the Q-learning algorithm.", "Here\u2019s a video demonstration of a PacMan Agent that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning.", "Q-learning and SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) are two commonly used model-free RL algorithms. They differ in terms of their exploration strategies while their exploitation strategies are similar. While Q-learning is an off-policy method in which the agent learns the value based on action a* derived from the another policy, SARSA is an on-policy method where it learns the value based on its current action a derived from its current policy. These two methods are simple to implement but lack generality as they do not have the ability to estimates values for unseen states.", "This can be overcome by more advanced algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks(DQNs) which use Neural Networks to estimate Q-values. But DQNs can only handle discrete, low-dimensional action spaces.", "Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) is a model-free, off-policy, actor-critic algorithm that tackles this problem by learning policies in high dimensional, continuous action spaces. The figure below is a representation of actor-critic architecture.", "Since, RL requires a lot of data, therefore it is most applicable in domains where simulated data is readily available like gameplay, robotics.", "Other applications of RL include abstractive text summarization engines, dialog agents(text, speech) which can learn from user interactions and improve with time, learning optimal treatment policies in healthcare and RL based agents for online stock trading.", "For understanding the basic concepts of RL, one can refer to the following resources.", "For getting started with building and testing RL agents, the following resources can be helpful.", "Your home for data science.
