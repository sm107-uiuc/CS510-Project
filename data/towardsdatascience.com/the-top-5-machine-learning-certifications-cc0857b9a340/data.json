I want to highlight what I think are the top five Machine Learning certificates of 2020. Some, you will have to pay for, and some are free. You can also opt to finish learnings only and prove to whomever you are sharing your completion with as a certificate itself. It is ultimately up to you on which certification you want, and how you want to display it. Below, I will be discussing a variety of Machine Learning certifications offered through a few websites and platforms (none of which I am affiliated with). These are courses that will allow you to receive a certificate after completion. I hope you find these to be useful and become motivated on becoming a well-certified Machine Learning Engineer, as well as Data Scientist, and Data Analyst.", "Here are the top five Machine Learning certificates for 2020:", "The first certificate on our ranking is quite popular. For this certificate, and the ones below, I will be giving some stats, an overview, what you will learn, and what makes the certificate different from others. To start, this certificate is offered through Coursera by Stanford University, and taught by the popular and highly rated Andrew Ng.", "As you can see, these stats are quite impressive. So, what is the general overview of this course? This course offers both theoretical and practical knowledge of Machine Learning topics \u2014 it is beneficial to learn both to be successful in your industry as a Machine Learning Engineer. Also stressed in this course, is that what you learn will the ability to learn problem-solving through practicing problems that would be encountered in real-world situations.", "Over the course of 11 weeks, you will learn the main topics of Machine Learning, but what makes this course different?", "In your last week, you will have five videos, one reading, and one quiz on the application of photo OCR. Not only is this a unique offering, but it is also quite interesting. You will go over the problem, pipeline, sliding windows, artificial data, and ceiling analysis. Also unique are the Octave/Matlab tutorials. You can also share your certificate on LinkedIn.", "Here is the direct link to this course [3].", "The second course is also offered through Coursera and deeplearning.ai with a focus on TensorFlow.", "You will of course learn about TensorFlow along with its neural network and computer vision applications as well. You will also go over natural language processing (NLP). There is also a focus on real-world problem solving, with importance on image data as well as how you can prevent overfitting. Key algorithms discussed and practiced are RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs.", "Highly specialized in TensorFlow, this certificate will allow you to benefit from being a master in one area of Machine Learning. This course is also different and beneficial from its focus on natural language processing in regards to TensorFlow. You can learn about processing text, along with tokenizing before being inputted into a neural network. You can also share your certificate on LinkedIn.", "Here is the direct link to this course [5].", "If you are new to AWS, this course and its respective certificate is an excellent way to focus on learning Machine Learning for AWS and its applications. This course and certificate are also offered through Coursera by AWS.", "As you can see, this course is rather short, which is excellent if you want to jump in and see what learning these courses and earning a certificate feels like \u2014 but on a smaller scale. This course covers Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and of course, Amazon SageMaker. If you are looking at new jobs at the moment, you can find job descriptions and see if AWS is recommended or required in order to apply and work at that job.", "Therefore, you would be highly qualified with a certification like this one, as well as continuing on to more advanced levels of AWS.", "You will of course focus on Machine Learning with respect to AWS. It is beneficial to receive broad overviews of Machine Learning topics and become certified in those respective topics, but it is also important to obtain specialized certifications (in, of course, something that you are interested in \u2014 especially if you want to perform it every day at your job). Some specific differentiation of this course and certificate is the object detection on images as well as text classification models with Glue and SageMaker. You can also share this certificate on LinkedIn.", "Here is the direct link to this course [7].", "This course and certification are offered through Udemy. The focus on this certificate is automating analytics from Oracle Analytics Cloud with not just Machine Learning, but also data visualizations, and a heavy focus on business analytics.", "It is required that you have a basic understanding of business analytics, stations, and want to learn about visualization. There is also a focus on hands-on training. You will also focus more on how to tie in Machine Learning with the problems of a business. You will work on business intelligence and data flows as well.", "Like how some of the other certificates focused on a primary tool, so does this course and certificate \u2014 Oracle Analytics. You will learn more about the business setting in regards to Machine Learning with this certificate. An example is a storytelling section of the analytics section of this course. Also, there is Machine Learning for business users highlighted that is unique. This course is more for Data Scientists or Business Analysts who want to become familiar with Machine Learning and try their hand at some complex algorithms \u2014 ultimately becoming highly cross-functional in the workforce.", "Here is the direct link to this course [9].", "This last certificate is offered by LinkedIn itself, so you can be sure that you can share your certificate there. I like how this course and certificate offers a focus on recommender systems with both Machine Learning and AI.", "This certificate will allow you to be proficient in automated recommendation systems. You will be able to build your own, including, but not limited to neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.", "This course and its respective certificate on Linkedin is different because it not only includes real-world applications of Machine Learning, but also presents case studies. Two popular case studies included are YouTube and Netflix \u2014 Netflix Technology Blog.", "Here is the direct link to this course [11].", "There are several courses and respective certificates. Many are extremely useful. I have included what I think are the top five certificates to obtain in 2020 for Machine Learning (Engineers). Some of these certificates can apply to not only Machine Learning Eningeres, but Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, and Business Analysts as well. Machine Learning is a broad field that overlaps in several areas, so it is useful and beneficial to obtain different learnings from different sources so that you can diversity your knowledge, and become a better Machine Learning Engineer.", "To summarize, here are the top certificates in one spot:", "I hope you found this article interesting and useful. Feel free to comment down below your experience with any of these courses and certifications, as well as any new ones that you recommend.
