My background is mostly about mathematics, so I decided to go on an adventure along the oil pipeline.", "One thing that I noticed is oil and gas is a big industry with old infrastructure. In 2014, Inside Energy reported that 45% of the U.S. crude oil pipeline was more than 50 years old. Some pipeline even laid in and before the 1920s is still in operation. That ancient, aging infrastructure can cause a catastrophe, such as oil leakage, which would affect company revenue, environment, and people in the surrounding area.", "So what is the culprit of all of these oil leakages? Let\u2019s dive into the oil!", "The data includes a record for each oil pipeline leakages or spills reported to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration from 2010 to 2017. There were 2795 leakages in the spans of more than 7 years. There are 46 features describe each incident. Some of the noteworthy ones are: incident date and time, operator name, cause of the incident, type of hazardous liquid, quantity lost, injuries and fatalities, and associated costs", "The data is rich and descriptive. I picked up a few interesting features and started from here", "Observe that 2017 has uncompleted data. The highest peak was in 2015 with 462 cases", "There is no time-zone adjusted here but I can safely assume that most of the cases happened at the business hour.", "Interestingly, in December there were only a few cases (212). But in January, it dramatically increased (275). I wonder if there was a trend here due to the operating transition from the old to the new year, or, it might just be a random series of leakages that happened in January?", "According to the geo graph that I created by plotly , it seems to me that the leakages happened along the pipelines. Texas has the most incidents among all states (1004 cases). This is no surprise since Texas is the largest domestic producer of oil in the US. I assumed that Texas would lose the most money but it was not the case \u2026", "Let\u2019s take a look at the top 3 states in term of losing money:", "2nd place belongs to California with 153 accidents and 3,390 barrel loss, and the net loss of 192. mil", "My assumption was completely wrong, the number of accidents is not correlated with the net loss. Moreover, the number of barrel loss does not take account of where the money went.", "The missing pieces of the puzzle are other features, which I naively thought that they were unimportant. The other features I should have considered are:", "The 2010 spike that you see took account for 95% of the total net loss in Michigan, and 36% of the total net loss in the US in 7 years period! A little research shows that this incident was the Kalamazoo River oil spill on July 25th. When a pipeline operated by Enbridge (Line 6B) burst and flowed into Talmadge Creek, it was left unnoticed for 18 hours. The crew misconstrued the anomalous pressure data and thought that it was caused by bubbles in the pipeline. Consequently, they restarted the line twice and made the oil escape much faster.", "The list of the top 10 incidents in Michigan will give you a better picture of how much damage the Kalamazoo River oil spill has caused to the state.", "Equipment failure is the short answer to this question. Human capability is very limited when it comes to interpreting data with many parameters. Reading data manually can lead to overlooking the anomaly and caused heavy damage to the business. In fact, material/weld/equipment failures contributed to 53% of the loss of all causes.", "Fortunately, with the growth of machine learning, many large oil companies have started applying AI to their infrastructure to help prevent equipment failures and benefit their business.", "Back in October 2019, I participated in the Datathon hosted by Texas A&M University. One of the challenges was to predict downhole equipment failures using sensor data sponsored by ConocoPhillips. I did not do the challenge but I was fascinated about this problem and still remember it. The previous analysis has provided me enough motivation to go back and look at this data set again.", "The training set consists of 60000 observations and 170 sensor values. These sensors are classified into 2 types:", "The job is to classify whether the observation is a failure or not failure. The histogram below shows the train set distribution:", "The data contains many null values. I have to create a function that takes in the different thresholds, treats missing values case-by-case, and hyper-tuning this function for the optimal result. I used xgboost to make the prediction withf1-score as the metric.", "I applied my model on 16001 different observations on the test set. After submitting the predictions I achieve 0.99383 on the first attempt.", "If the oil industry invested in researching AI, they would have detected defective equipment faster, prevent catastrophes more efficiently, and saved a lot of money. Specifically, the Kalamazoo River oil spill incident could have been avoided with machine learning.", "I hope that you enjoy reading my article and following with me on this journey.
