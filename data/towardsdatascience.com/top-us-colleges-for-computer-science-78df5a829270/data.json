During my life, I\u2019ve hopped across multiple schools, including MIT, Oxford, Columbia, Imperial College, Caltech, Stanford and Berkeley.", "So based on my experience, I\u2019ve decided to create a top of schools for computer science in 2020 so that you folks, who are looking to get a degree in computer science can have a clue of what schools are great to attend to.", "I want to admit, that this is based on my personal viewpoint and I believe there are many other awesome schools for computer science, which I won\u2019t mention in this article purely because I haven\u2019t had direct experience with them. In all the cases below, I\u2019ve either studied, worked, or been close friends with people who have taken or helped teach the classes and programs mentioned.", "So let\u2019s start with the Ivy League. There are 8 schools that compose the Ivy League: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale.", "These schools have arguably the \u201cbest\u201d reputation\u201d in general, and you typically find them dominating the top 10 \u201cBest Colleges\u201d on US News, Forbes, and Business Insider.", "All of these schools have great computer science degrees based on my friend\u2019s opinions. Among all of them, I think that the best one is a tie breaker between Harvard and Columbia. For schedule flexibility, Brown is the most lenient, while UPenn and Cornell are arguably some of the physically largest universities in the \u201cLeague.\u201d Both Yale and Princeton have much smaller, tight knit communities, being a little bit isolated from \u201clarger, big cities.\u201d", "Columbia is nestled in the heart of NYC, and has that pulse of Manhattan, with both the ups and the downs that come with big city life.", "I\u2019ve only taken courses or studied at two of these \u2014 Columbia and Harvard. Both of these schools have highly structured computer science programs, and I\u2019ve worked with some extremely bright, sharp, and hard working undergraduates, grad students, and faculty from these two universities.", "Over time, I\u2019ve observed that specific CS classes at both Columbia and Harvard possess such a powerful following that they create communities complete with their own internal norms and cultures.", "A top class at Harvard is CS50, taught by the charismatic David Malan. Last I checked, CS50 gives students a taste of C, Python, Javascript with CSS and HTML, and SQL. In terms of customizing your CS education at Harvard, it\u2019s very flexible with the option to explore a unique\u201cMind Brain and Behavior track,\u201d along with exploring joint concentrations.", "At Columbia, the CS program is strongly integrated with other divisions and schools. There are somewhere around 7 different specializations, that range from \u201cintelligent systems\u201d to \u201crobotics.\u201d One standout class at Columbia which I\u2019ve noticed gives undergraduates a nice advantage after they finish their studies is their exposure to C and C++. Professor \u201cJ\u201d used to teach this class and as a mandatory requirement, I recall many of my undergrad friends and students telling me this class was brutal. However, years later, in the work-force, their exposure to C, C++, and UNIX shell scripting served them well.", "So, if you\u2019re looking for a computer science degree, consider that while all of the Ivy League schools can give you a solid and reliable CS education; the top options are Harvard and Columbia.", "And now let\u2019s talk about schools that are not Ivy League but offer a world class education in computer science in the US.", "Stanford is nestled in the heart of Silicon Valley, and offers ample industry-academic opportunity. They do a lot of innovative research in Theory, Human Computer Interaction, and artificial intelligence. They currently have 17 Nobel Laureates teaching on campus.I used to work out of the basement in the Huang Engineering and Science Center ( named after CEO Jensen Huang of NVIDIA), and I will tell you \u2014 the hustle spirit at Stanford is STRONG.", "I\u2019ve seen students work late into the night in the basement here, with groups of about 8\u201315 students huddled around massive tables and TA\u2019s tirelessly answering all their questions. When I imagine the CS spirit of collaboration, I always imagine the teamwork exhibited bystanders Stanford students. From friends who went to MIT with me and went on to Stanford for their Master\u2019s, a key element that stood out was the observed happiness level.", "Some people might attribute this to the fact that with most Stanford CS courses ( and this is definitely not all, there are some difficult classes), somewhere between 30\u201350% of students can get an A. This was a huge shock for one of my friends who also went to MIT with me, because the curve was definitely not that generous. Not that grades are a super accurate indicator of being an excellent engineer ( they really aren\u2019t), but the pressure of not having to freak out about having an excellent GPA must be a relief and welcome alternative from other, less forgiving institutions.", "And now let\u2019s discuss Berkeley. Relative to the other schools mentioned, Berkeley is among the top public schools and a more affordable option. If you\u2019re from California and budget conscious, then Berkeley is a great alternative.", "I personally worked with Blockchain at Berkeley and have several friends studying there in Computer Science and Robotics. Known to be pressure cooker, competition for space in class is fierce, but this comes with the territory of most public universities.", "I recall that CS 61A with Denero transformed the lives of several people in my friend group, laying a solid foundation for people who had never programmed or written software before they turned 18 or started college. Likewise, CS 61B, Data Structures would be among the most critical course to prepare you for the technical part of a software engineering interview. So if you\u2019re not afraid of large classes, you\u2019re competitive, and you\u2019re short on money, then Berkeley is an excellent choice.", "Many people would argue that Caltech is among the toughest schools on the West Coast. It\u2019s one of the smallest universities in the USA, with a population of roughly 200 students per class. They also usually are considered our rivals at MIT. Their core curriculum is aggressive \u2014 all students are required to study quantum mechanics.", "The Center for Autonomous Systems is a new initiative launched at Caltech, with some incredible faculty dedicated to developing Robotic Explorers, Guardians, Transformers, and Transporters. Sound sci-fi? You bet! I\u2019m pretty confident when I say that what we think of science fiction today will become tomorrow\u2019s scientific reality due to the amazing work at Caltech. If you want to have a challenge, have the opportunity for ample one-on-one mentorship and communication with faculty, and want to be half an hour away from La-La Land, then check out Caltech.", "The last on this list Carnegie Mellon. Now, this school is particularly fascinating because it is both among the Top in Computer Science and the top in Drama. The students from this school are committed, passionate, and they are no stranger to challenge. Some of my colleagues and friends from here have went on to become incredible tech leads, directors, and IP lawyers who happened to build an Intel Pentium chip or two along the way. Among the schools in this category, CMU has one of the highest acceptance rates, at around 17% in 2019.", "And now, from my own perspective colored by the Institute itself, I would argue that the best university for CS is\u2026.", "1056 professors. 90 Nobel laureates. 59 National Medal of Science winners. 75 MacArthur Fellows. 15 A.M. Turing Award winners.", "MIT is one of the hardest schools to attend at in the United States. Most students at MIT study late into the night, and we abide by the philosophy of work hard, play hard.", "MIT\u2019s CS program, what we call \u201cCourse 6\u201d was and probably still is, among the top 3 most popular and most common majors. Since you\u2019re studying with some of the other brightest minds around the world, the experience quickly humbles you.", "There\u2019s a wide range of experience that people come into Course 6 with. When I sat in on some classes, I would have an International Chemistry Olympiad winner to my left, and somebody who had already interned at Amazon as a software engineer before they began their freshman / 1st year.", "The most \u201cvaluable\u201d class at MIT that changed lives and paradigms was 6.006 \u2014 Introduction to Algorithms. From my experience, MIT\u2019s classes slanted far more theoretical than other universities. I think this came from the department\u2019s emphasis that if we could learn how to learn, and if we understood the fundamental principles , we could really solve anything, or build out any application.", "In this class, you typically had to understand the underlying theory or proof behind an algorithm, as well as be able to implement it in Python. MIT also had a culture of p-setting in groups. Teamwork was essential, and late nights, glowing screens of LEDs, and fluctuating levels of attention, stress, and flow were tantamount to the experience. DM me if you have additional questions about MIT, I\u2019m happy to share more with you.", "Alright, so you might think that MIT is among the best schools, which it is. However, I would also say\u2026 to think twice before you come here. While you will be among the brightest minds and learn from the most inspiring and sharpest professors, we don\u2019t have grade inflation here.", "You will drink from the fire hose. You will also have to be ready for the largest challenge (technically and mentally). Egos will be crushed and your understanding of what you know and don\u2019t know will be dramatically rewritten. And that\u2019s OK. It is through a constant creation and destruction of the self, that humans acquire their inner power.", "As bonus I\u2019d like to emphasize that there are many great schools outside the USA. For instance, I\u2019ve also studied and worked at the University of Waterloo, the University of Oxford, and the Imperial College of London. The students there are just as driven, motivated, and clever as their American counterparts.", "I refrain from including an evaluation of them here, just because the coursework, program structure, and timelines are pretty different than what we have on this side of the world. These admissions systems are totally different than what we have here in the US, but there are many excellent options for students willing to live abroad. I\u2019m happy to explain the difference to each of you guys, and feel free to DM me if you want to learn more about some international options outside of Good Old America!", "Your home for data science.
