It is used to model count-based data, like the number of emails arriving in your mailbox in one hour or the number of customers walking into a shop in one day, for instance.", "Let\u2019s start with an example, Figure 1 shows the number of emails received by Sarah in intervals of one hour.", "Figure 1: Emails received by Sarah in one-hour intervals for the last 100 hours. (image by author)", "The bar heights show the number of one-hour intervals in which Sarah observed the corresponding number of emails. For instance, the highlighted bar shows that there were around 15 one-hour slots where she received a single email.", "The Poisson distribution is parametrized by the expected number of events \u03bb (pronounced \u201clambda\u201d) in a time or space window. The distribution is a function that takes the number of occurrences of the event as input (the integer called k in the next formula) and outputs the corresponding probability (the probability that there are k events occurring).", "The Poisson distribution, denoted as \u2018Poi\u2019 is expressed as follows:", "The formula of Poi(k ; \u03bb) returns the probability of observing k events given the parameter \u03bb which corresponds to the expected number of occurrences in that time slot.", "Note that both the binomial and the Poisson distributions are discrete: they give probabilities of discrete outcomes: the number of times an event occurs for the Poisson distribution and the number of successes for the binomial distribution. However, while the binomial calculates this discrete number for a discrete number of trials (like a number of coin tosses), the Poisson considers an infinite number of trials (each trial corresponds to a very small portion of time) leading to a very small probability associated with each event.", "You\u2019ll see below how the Poisson distribution is derived from the binomial distribution.", "Priya is recording birds in a national park, using a microphone placed in a tree. She is counting the number of times a bird is recorded singing and wants to model the number of birds singing in a minute. For this task, she\u2019ll assume the independence of the detected birds.", "Looking at the data of the last few hours, Priya observes that on average, there are two birds detected in an interval of one minute. So the value 2 could be a good candidate for the parameter of the distribution \u03bb. Her goal is to know the probability that a specific number of birds will sing in the next minute.", "Let\u2019s implement the Poisson distribution function from the formula you saw above:", "Remember that \u03bb is the expected number of times a bird sings in a one-minute interval, so in this example, you have \u03bb=2. The function poisson_distribution(k, lambd) takes the value of k and \u03bb and returns the probability to observe k occurrences (that is, to record k birds singing).", "For instance, the probability of Priya observing 5 birds in the next minute would be:", "The probability that 5 birds will sing in the next minute is around 0.036 (3.6%).", "As with the binomial function, this will overflow for larger values of k. For this reason, you might want to use poisson from the module scipy.stats, as follows:", "Let\u2019s plot the distribution for various values of k:", "Figure 2: Poisson distribution for \u03bb=2. (image by author)", "The probabilities corresponding to the values of k are summarized in the probability mass function shown in Figure 2. You can see that it is most probable that Priya will hear one or two birds singing in the next minute.", "Finally, you can plot the function for different values of \u03bb:", "Figure 3: Poisson distribution for various values of \u03bb. (image by author)", "Figure 3 shows the Poisson distribution for various values of \u03bb, which looks a bit like a normal distribution in some cases. However, the Poisson distribution is discrete, not symmetric when the value of \u03bb is low, and bounded to zero.", "Let\u2019s see how the Poisson distribution is derived from the Binomial distribution.", "You saw in Essential Math for Data Science that if you run a random experiment multiple times, the probability to get m successes over N trials, with a probability of a success \u03bc at each trial, is calculated through the binomial distribution:", "How can you use the binomial formula to model the probability to observe an event a certain number of times in a given time interval instead of in a certain number of trials? There are a few problems:", "To address the first point, you can consider time as small discrete chunks. Let\u2019s call these chunks \u03f5 (pronounced \u201cepsilon\u201d), as shown in Figure 4. If you consider each chunk as a trial, you have N chunks.", "Figure 4: You can split the continuous time in segments of length \u03f5. (image by author)", "The estimation of a continuous time scale is more accurate when \u03f5 is very small. If \u03f5 is small, the number of segments N will be large. In addition, since the segments are small, the probability of success in each segment is also small.", "To summarize, you want to modify the binomial distribution to be able to model a very large number of trials, each with a very small probability of success. The trick is to consider that N tends toward infinity (because continuous time is approximated by having a value of \u03f5 that tends toward zero).", "Let\u2019s find \u03bc in this case and replace it in the binomial formula. You know the expected number of event in a period of time t, which we\u2019ll call \u03bb (pronounced \u201clambda\u201d). Since you split t into small intervals of length \u03f5, you have the number of trials:", "You have \u03bb as the number of successes in the N trials. So the probability \u03bc to have a success in one trial is:", "Replacing \u03bc in the binomial formula, you get:", "Developing the expression, writing the binomial coefficient as factorials (as you did in Essential Math for Data Science), and using the fact a^{b-c}=a^b-a^c, you have:", "Let\u2019s consider the first element of this expression. If you state that N tends toward infinity (because \u03f5 tends toward zero), you have:", "This is because k can be ignored when it is small in comparison to N. For instance, you have:", "So you the first ratio becomes:", "Finally, since what\u2019s inside the parentheses tends toward 1 when N tends toward the infinity:", "Let\u2019s replace all of this in the formula of the binomial distribution:", "This post is a sample of my book Essential Math for Data Science!", "Your home for data science.
