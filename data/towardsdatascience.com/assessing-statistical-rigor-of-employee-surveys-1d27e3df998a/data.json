In fact, to ensure unbiased and fair hiring practices the US department of labor maintains a set of guidelines (Uniform Guidelines) to aid HR professionals in their assessment development ventures.", "Personality assessments are often used in selection batteries to determine cultural fit into a company. Cognitive ability (ie. IQ) tests are consistently found to be the best overall predictor of job performance across all types and levels of jobs (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). Structured interviews are used extensively in hiring decisions as they help to remove bias by standardizing the question and scoring. Performance reviews use rigorous Likert assessments that ask managers and co-workers to rate employees of their performance (ie. behaviorally anchored rating scales). Employee engagement surveys assess the extent employees feel satisfaction, passion, effort, and commitment to their employer and job. Last but not least, employee exit surveys are often employed upon the termination of an employee in order to determine how the employee felt about a range of topics related to the organization.", "This extensive use of employee assessment has given rise to a multi-billion dollar industry specializing in the development of a wide range of tests. Let\u2019s focus our attention on employee attitude surveys as they form a very large segment of this industry. If one is to purchase a survey how can you be sure you are getting a quality product? Any reputable developer should supply you with not only a manual but also a validation report which outlines the steps taken to make sure the survey is actually measuring what it\u2019s meant to measure.", "In this article, I would like to examine an employee exit survey and determine the quality of the survey based on a selected few metrics. Therefore, when you are handed a validation report from a survey vendor you will know and understand the metrics needed to make an informed purchase.", "Before we jump into our metrics and code, let\u2019s take a few mins to review how a statistically rigorous survey is developed and validated.", "First and foremost, this fictional dataset and its results should be treated as such, fictional. Secondly, termination reason (ie. voluntary, involuntary, retirement, etc.) have been omitted from the loaded dataset as this article will focus exclusively on the psychometric properties on the Likert-scale questions.", "Upon loading our libraries, we have a dataset of about 702 employees who answered 27 Likert-type questions where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree. The questions asked terminated employees on their perceptions on promotional opportunities, manager satisfaction, job satisfaction, training, and work/life balance.", "We have to acknowledge the fact that terminated employees are not required to fill out an exit survey. It is completely at their discretion and as such the results from such survey may be skewed", "As discussed above, carefully designed surveys have their roots in validated scholarly models and this survey is no different. The 27 individual items have been developed to assess 8 underlying or latent factors.", "When dealing with quantitative questions the first tool at our disposal is the trusty correlation. A correlation matrix will give us the first clues as to the psychometric quality of our survey. The correlations highlighted in green are those of the items meant to measure the same underlying latent construct. These correlations should retain a relatively high correlation (0.5 to 0.7) as that would indicate the items are measuring several unique sub-components of a larger construct. However, if the correlations are too large (0.7+) that would signify the items might be measuring very similar or even the same constructs. We ultimately want our questions to be assessing different sub-components of a larger factor such as \u201cJob Satisfaction\u201d.", "On the other hand, correlations outside of the highlighted areas should remain as low as possible. That would indicate that the items are measuring vastly different constructs. For example, the high correlation between direct_mgmt_satisfaction and feed_offered (0.75) is rather discouraging as they are measuring different latent constructs (employee value and management satisfaction). On the other hand, this correlation also gives us a glimpse into a miss-classification of the \u201cfeedback_offered\u201d item as it is the manager that most often provides constructive feedback and, therefore, one might reason this item is actually assessing management satisfaction instead.", "Overall, looking at the correlation matrix it would seem management satisfaction, job satisfaction, team satisfaction, training satisfaction, and work/life balance are relatively strong latent factors. On the other hand, employee value and organizational environment are rather weak. Finally, salary satisfaction is composed of one question.", "Reliability is a measure of consistency. In other words, if someone were to take the same personality assessment multiple times their scores should not vary a large amount. The most prominent reliability metric when developing surveys is Cronbach\u2019s Alpha and it\u2019s a measure of internal consistency. The Alpha assumes unidimensional or that the items passed into its function are measuring one factor, therefore, we need to calculate Alpha for each latent factor separately.", "Mgmt satisfaction, job satisfaction, team satisfaction, and training satisfaction all exhibit high to very high alpha coefficients (0.8+). High alpha results signify the items are measuring the same underlying construct. Employee valued, org environment, and work-life balance resulted in lower alpha coefficients which means the items can be improved to better measure their constructs. We need at least 2 items to measure alpha therefore, salary_satisfaction was not included in this analysis.", "Another commonly used reliability measure is \u201cTest-Retest Reliability\u201d. The survey is administered to the same sample multiple times and the scores are compared to determine consistency.", "Factor analysis or more specifically Exploratory Factor Analysis is often used in the survey development process. It is used to conduct a preliminary exploration of the assessment during the development stage. Factor analysis is a data reduction technique that attempts to extract the commonly held variance between features into a factor. In other words, survey items that are meant to assess a common latent factor will covary together. Covary in the sense that if someone answers \u201cstrongly agree\u201d on the first question they will most likely answer in a similar fashion on a different question which is meant to assess the underlying latent factor.", "EFA is similar to a PCA (principal component analysis) in terms of dimensionality reduction but it has certain differences:", "Before attempting to use a factor analysis one should conduct the \u201cBartlett\u2019s Test of Sphericity\u201d which examines whether or not there are multiple features that can be reduced to latent factors. The result of Bartlett\u2019s test is significant (p=0.00) which means the data can be reduced and we can continue with the factor analysis.", "We can use a scree plot to determine the optimal number of factors. The Kaiser criteria mentions a factor should account for a certain amount of variance for it to be considered a valid factor. We typically set the cut-off at 1 eigenvalue.", "Despite the scree plot of 5 optimal factors, we know the survey was developed to contain 8 latent factors. Finally, the cut-off value for loading scores is rather subjective but we are going to use 0.5.", "Factor 1: All but one \u201cmanagement satisfaction\u201d item seem to load very highly on this factor. We also have items from \u201cemployee_valued\u201d, and \u201corg_environment\u201d loading highly onto Factor 1. Furthermore, it would seem the items assessing the \u201cmanagement satisfaction\u201d construct situate the survey taker in a holistic organizational perspective or mindset when answering the questions. In other words, the individual is asked to think about management holistically. However, when the survey taker comes to the \u201cdirect_mgmt_satisfaction\u201d question their perspective is narrowed and despite enjoying the broader organizational leadership their opinion of their direct manager might differ. This might explain why the \u201cdirect_mgmt_satisfaction\u201d item loads so low on factor 1.", "I would suggest the survey to separate out the management latent construct into broad leadership and direct manager satisfaction. Furthermore, I would strongly suggest the \u201cemployee_value\u201d construct needs to be rethought as the items do not load together on any factor.", "Factor 2: This factor almost perfectly loads onto the \u201cjob satisfaction\u201d construct. This would indicate the items have been well developed and are measuring what they indented to measure.", "Factor 3: \u201cTraining satisfaction\u201d perfectly loads onto factor 3. However, it is important to mention the item \u201cassessing promotional_opportunities\u201d has a somewhat positive loading. This would make sense as an organization which offers training opportunities for their employees is surely to have a good succession plan in place.", "Factor 4: Factor 4 seems to correspond with the \u201cteam_satisfaction\u201d construct. Although, the \u201cteam_culture\u201d item needs to be improved due to its low loading. Items that attempt to assess ambiguous topics such as \u201cculture\u201d often present with low loadings onto their designated constructs. Perhaps focusing the item on one or two specific components of an organizational culture model would definitely help to narrow down the question.", "Factor 5: This factor loads great with the \u201cwork/life balance\u201d latent construct.", "Factor 6: It is interesting to see that both \u201cteam_comm\u201d and \u201cteam_culture\u201d load very highly onto factor 6 despite the fact \u201cteam_comm\u201d also loads onto factor 4. Because \u201cteam_comm\u201d loads highly on two factors, this would indicate the question might be interpreted differently by the survey takers. Perhaps adding some context into the question might help to improve its loading onto factor 4. Finally, simply changing the order of the questions which assess \u201cteam satisfaction\u201d might help these two items to load better on factor 4.", "Factor 7: We are not seeing any identifiable constructs loading onto factor 7.", "Factor 8: This is the only factor where the \u201cfair_salary\u201d item seems to load. This construct certainly needs additional questions before any recommendations can be made.", "A confirmatory factor analysis is used most often to confirm already validated assessments. For example, you wish to conduct an employee engagement assessment using an off-the-shelf survey purchased from a vendor. It might be a good idea to run a pilot test using the survey on your specific organizational sample of employees. A CFA would be a great tool to confirm the underlying constructs the survey purports to measure but using your sample of employees.", "In reality, researchers will often use both factor analyses to validate their assessments. There is nothing wrong with using an EFA to observe purposefully developed constructs. I have found that the results of an EFA can be tremendously helpful in distilling issues with the individual items. Once you have improved the items based on the EFA results the CFA results will typically increase as well.", "The CFA results seem to mostly confirm the results obtained from the correlation matrix, alpha reliability, and EFA. The items assessing the \u201cemployee_value\u201d construct certainly need to be polished as there seems to be some confusion about what is being measured. \u201cPerformance_recognized\u201d and \u201cfeedback_offered\u201d seem to be measuring one underlying construct as their correlation is 0.63 and their loadings on both the EFA and CFA are high. The alpha reliability for this construct is borderline acceptable (0.79) and as we look at additional metrics there is certainly work needed to be done on this construct.", "With the exception of \u201cdirect _mgmt_satisfaction,\u201d the items measuring management satisfaction are well developed and stands up to the rigorous testing of correlations, alpha reliability, and factor analysis. As mentioned previously, there might be a scale issue with the \u201cdirect _mgmt_satisfaction\u201d question compared to the rest of the questions. Survey takers are mostly answering questions regarding the broader leadership construct and this question asks about their direct manager.", "All 4 analyses support the quality of the items assessing this construct. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing :)", "This construct had some contradicting loading results when comparing the EFA and CFA. Nevertheless, these contradictions, borderline alpha reliability, and less than stunning correlations among the items point to much needed revision of the questions. I believe the construct of a team is well operationalized but the notion of \u201cteam culture\u201d might be interpreted differently among those taking the survey.", "It is important to offer at least 3 questions per construct in order to establish credible reliability and construct validity. The two items measuring this construct are very well written and seem to be assessing one factor. I would like to see additional questions. Kirkpatrick\u2019s training evaluation model can serve as the basis for additional questions.", "Unfortunately, much like \u201cemployee value\u201d this construct needs major edits. All the metrics resulted in subpar results and from a face-validity perspective, it is simply difficult to mentally encompass these items into one cohesive construct.", "Much like \u201ctraining satisfaction\u201d this construct has performed well but we would like to see at least 3 items per construct.", "This construct was composed of one item and from a practical perspective, it is simply lacking. Even Cronbach\u2019s alpha requires at least 2 questions.", "There is certainly a large amount of work which goes into developing employee surveys. What\u2019s more, when the survey becomes an assessment (ie. cognitive ability or skill test) used in a hiring process the rigor and documentation increases exponentially. I hope you enjoyed a glimpse into some of the work I/O psychologists perform. As always I welcome your feedback.", "Your home for data science.
