Our team has been experimenting with various natural language processing methods to discover trends and hidden patterns in different types of online media. You may find our tools and presentations here.", "This post is part of our mini-series presenting the results of our latest analysis of technology news. We have two main goals:", "Our text mining exercises are based on a technology news data set that consists of more than 200k tech media articles collected between 01.2016 and 05.2019. More information on the data set is available at our Zenodo repository.", "In this installment we demonstrate how dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE along with popular topic modelling algorithm (LDA) can be used to map tech oriented news articles. We show that these methods applied together can reinforce and complement each other.", "We start with a brief introduction to t-SNE algorithm. Then, we present results of our mapping exercise.", "t-SNE has been introduced by van der Maaten and Hinton (2008) and followed multiple attempts to find a dimensionality reduction algorithm preserving local structure. In contrast to earlier algorithms, it managed to gain traction and has been cited in almost 10 thousand articles according to Google Scholar.", "SNE, the base algorithm for t-SNE, minimizes the difference between probability distributions for full-dimensional and low-dimensional embeddings. The goal is to preserve conditional probabilities that a point would choose another point as its neighbor. The distributions are Gaussian, and the standard deviation for a given point (it is not constant for all points) is chosen based on perplexity, which can be understood as the number of nearest neighbors considered. Gradient descent finds the local minimum.", "The algorithm suffers from crowding problem \u2014 in a 3-dimensional space, one can find 4 points which are all equidistant to each other (corners of a tetrahedron), while in 2 dimensions, only 3 such points may exist (triangle). Preserving this similarity in transformation from 3 to 2 dimensions is mathematically impossible, but switching the low-dimensional distribution to one with heavier tails alleviates the crowding problem.", "No promise is made to maintain the global structure of data. However, recent developments in biology \u2014 where t-SNE is widely used in transcriptomics \u2014 describe improvements in visualization regarding the global structure. The procedure (Kobak, Berens 2018) uses PCA as the starting point for visualizations and employs \u201cperplexity annealing\u201d \u2014 output from high-perplexity t-SNE is used as initialization for lower-perplexity t-SNE. Their visualizations are different in some ways to our data \u2014 PCA delivers fairly good results in transcriptomics, but is useless as a standalone tool in text mining.", "Our results show that using PCA as initialization for t-SNE has various advantages. We will use this combination of methods to cluster articles in a two-dimensional space: articles covering similar topics will be placed close to each other by the algorithm.", "We were able to observe the most prevalent topics from the topic modelling analysis. However, it is difficult to unravel further details based on the analysis of topic-words. To examine which articles discuss the various topics, we turn to document clustering with t-SNE.", "The map presents the articles in two dimensions: neighbouring articles are characterised by similar vocabulary and are likely to cover the same subject. Additionally, we also mark the results of the topic modelling analysis with colours: it marks the dominant topic of the document. For better visibility, the map presents different colours for the 8 most frequent topics, while the rest is merged into one category (\u2018Other\u2019). The map also enables to view the article titles below the chart.", "The map shows that LDA and t-SNE similarly grouped our documents: articles with the same colour are placed close to each other by t-SNE. We can identify large groups of green, blue, purple etc. articles. This supports the robustness of the text mining strategy.", "Moreover, the map proves the aptitude of our methods to provide clusters of articles with different levels of granularity. Based on the analysis of clusters, we are able to identify more specific areas inside the wide umbrella topics determined by LDA. As an example, LDA returned a broad category of articles dealing mostly with social media crisis issues. t-SNE helps us to further classify these articles into smaller clusters: focused on specific social media platforms (e.g. articles on Twitter can be found at (50,-10), on Facebook at (50,10), or on president Trump\u2019s usage of social media (0,-30)).", "Another advantage of t-SNE is demonstrated by the cluster on the Apple-FBI Encryption Debate (35,10). Based on the LDA topic terms, we named the entire green topic as social media crisis, while the group of articles also include other tech policy areas. t-SNE helps us in recognising these more nuanced details.", "It is also worth noticing how t-SNE grouped together articles from various LDA topics that share a common feature. One such example is the cluster on Google (20, 10) that includes stories on the problems of Youtube, business news or articles on Google\u2019s software development for smartphones.", "Clouds proximity to each other also seems to be meaningful and informative as it can be observed by the example of the AI & robots cluster. In the upper left part of the figure (-35,30) you can find a group of articles covering robotics. The left part of the cloud consists of articles discussing mostly transformative potential of the robotic technologies (e.g. job automation), whereas the right part pertains to hardware issues (e.g. batteries). The whole robotics cluster is close to an another blue cluster related to conscious AI and real autonomous AI, lying in south-east direction (-30,20). More to the south articles regarding ethical aspects of AI can be found. As we can see distance in space resembles here the \u201cthematic distance\u201d.", "Similar regularities can be observed in the remaining clusters regarding: business news, smartphones, cybersecurity, cross platform development, streaming and space exploration.", "For example, in the case of cybersecurity articles there is a clear division between the cluster regarding security of decentralized networks (0,-55), and the cluster dealing with data breaches (15,-15). The latter one is positioned logically next to the cluster of articles concerning online privacy issues (10,-15).", "In the smartphone subcategory, we can observe that articles related to various VR technologies (0,55) are close to the articles on smartphone camera technologies (0,40). Articles on new features and sales of successive iPhone generations are gathered at (35,20), just to the right of a cluster related to iOS.", "We demonstrated the effectiveness of combining LDA topic modelling with t-SNE clustering. Topic modelling is useful in exploring broad topics (e.g. social media crisis, AI or business news) and grouping articles for further analysis. However, its usefulness for more nuanced, fine-grained analysis is limited. That is where t-SNE algorithms comes in handy. Our results show that this research method combination is well suited for mapping the tech news landscape. Particularly, our mapping exercise proves the aptitude of our methods to provide clusters of articles with different levels of granularity.", "Our full report covers also deep dives into umbrella topics recurring in the tech discussions (namely: AI & robots, policy, media, business and cybersecurity).", "Your home for data science.
