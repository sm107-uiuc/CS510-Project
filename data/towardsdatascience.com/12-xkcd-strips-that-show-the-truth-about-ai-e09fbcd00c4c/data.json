Artificial neural nets are inspired by this design, and while the simplest construct \u2014 a perceptron \u2014 is just a single neuron, modern neural nets (NNs) can reach up to a billion weights and millions of neurons.", "By learning patterns from data, NNs can accomplish a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to forecasting.", "However, if we take it too far, we might waste time building models when doing the work manually would work better.", "By all accounts, AI seems ubiquitous. Turn to Product Hunt, Twitter, or /r/startups, and it\u2019ll look like new AI solutions are popping up every minute.", "But is that really the case \u2014 or are some companies \u201ccheating\u201d? As it turns out, several companies have been caught in the act, claiming to use AI while actually outsourcing menial tasks. As Forbes reports, these are just some of the companies guilty of \u201cpseudo-AI\u201d:", "Though futurists and thought leaders might tell you otherwise, we really have no idea what will happen after a superintelligent AI is created.", "Will it be benevolent? Malevolent? Neutral? Non-sentient yet superintelligent? Whatever happens may surprise us all.", "Building data pipelines isn\u2019t easy. To build data products, you need to be able to collect data from potentially millions of users and process the results in near real-time. Your pipeline needs to be robust, scalable, efficient, and with monitoring capabilities.", "With how difficult it is, many pipelines don\u2019t check all the boxes.", "By training a neural network \u2014 or passing training data through a composite function many times, so as to learn patterns \u2014 we can predict new data. If you don\u2019t train long enough, your model will \u201cunderfit,\u201d or simply not have learned patterns in the data.", "You might end up with a chatbot that speaks gibberish, or a self-driving car that only drives straight.", "Cleverbot was released in 1997, so there\u2019s a long history of somewhat-decent chatbots.", "However, there\u2019s a big difference between an AI that creates something new and unique, and one that just retrieves what humans have done or said in the past \u2014 like Cleverbot.", "To be fair, modern chatbots have drastically improved on the technology, and are astonishingly accurate.", "For all the progress we\u2019ve made on AI, relatively little has been done in the way of explainability. While the idea of \u201cblack box\u201d AI is a bit of a myth \u2014 as there are ways to interpret the results \u2014 there isn\u2019t complete transparency or intuition into how most AI models, especially deep learning, really work under the hood.", "Asimov\u2019s third law of robotics is that a robot must protect its own existence. Nuclear blasts trigger EMPs that destroy electronics, so a sentient AI that abides by Asimov\u2019s laws may seek to destroy our nuclear weapons, rather than use them against us.", "There\u2019s a lot of fear-mongering about AI, some justified (AI may bake in racial and sexual biases, AI may spur job loss, and so on), others irrational (AI will kill us).", "However, all this fear forgets one thing: Humans, not AI, are the danger. The unfortunate truth is that up to a billion people have been killed in wars throughout history.", "In the seminal paper on Artificial Intelligence, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, Turing asked: \u201cCan machines think?\u201d \u2014 or, more accurately, can a machine imitate thought?", "So far, the answer is \u201cno,\u201d but we\u2019ll likely get there one day, and perhaps raise the bar with a new test.", "With every new AI advancement, cynics keep shifting the goalposts, and AI keeps catching up.", "In computing, two tasks that may seem similar to a lay-person could easily be the difference between trivial and near-impossible. Today, years after the creation of the strip above, image recognition tasks have been made far easier, but many other tasks prove incredibly challenging.", "For example, how can we create a neural network that is not only explainable, but intuitively interpretable? How can we create new state-of-the-art neural networks without simply adding more compute, more data, and more parameters? How can we create general AI, as opposed to narrow AI? How can we make level 5 autonomous driving \u2014 which can handle things like a road-worker holding a stop sign, while motioning, to the driver next to you, via eye contact, to proceed?", "There are many unanswered questions in the field, which makes it all the more exciting!", "If you\u2019d like to learn more about AI and data science, then follow me on Towards Data Science, and Apteo\u2019s data science blog that I contribute to.", "Your home for data science.
