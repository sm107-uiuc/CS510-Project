GitHub recently published a dataset of over 36K (!!) open-sourced repos where folks have contributed their time and code towards the community.", "As I was browsing the list of projects available, I was overwhelmed by the passion that developers, data scientists, and other technical communities have poured into projects around the world. From an app to track symptoms to extensive analysis on existing datasets, the long list of projects is truly inspiring.", "I found myself (virtually) discussing with friends about how we can contribute to these efforts. As we discussed building an analysis or tracking app, we realized it would be more impactful to contribute to COVID-19 open source efforts that are already underway. This led me to the idea of helping people find these great projects that are relevant to their skill sets, as easily as possible.", "Given the sheer volume, finding a project to contribute to can prove challenging. There is such a wide range of projects, covering many different languages and topics. To make this easier, we built a recommendation system. Given a set of languages and keywords that you are interested in, you can find a few projects that may be relevant to your input.

To do that, we are going to setup a few filters:", "Here\u2019s how we can apply those filters with pandas:", "We plan to use a text-based approach to recommending projects, utilizing a combination of the repo description, topics, and primary language as our core bag-of-words. In order to simplify our text processing, we are going to remove punctuation and limit to only english-speaking repo descriptions (more languages might be added later!). To do this, we will need to:", "To do the tasks above, we will setup a few helper functions that will be applied to the text within the dataset:", "Next, we will use these functions to work through the clean-up and filtering:", "After running all of these filters above, we now have about 1400 projects to recommend. Much smaller than our original set, but hopefully still enough to help users discover interesting projects that can be contributed to.", "As we discussed, we will recommend projects based on a bag-of-words consisting of the description, topics, and primary language. We need to take this large string of words, and turn it into a form that can be used for a recommendation algorithm. To do this, we will create a Vectorizer (also called a Tokenizer) that turned our strings into a sparse vector indicating which words are present in the string.", "To keep things simple, we will use sklearn\u2019s CountVectorizer. Before we run the vectorizer, there are a few important inputs to discuss:", "Lemmatizing is the process of taking multiple forms of a single word and converting them into a single \u201clemma\u201d of the word. For example, \u2018case\u2019 and \u2018cases\u2019 will both be converted to \u2018case\u2019. This is important to reduce the noise and sheer number of words considered when creating the vector. Here we create a LemmaTokenizer class using the WordNetLemmatizer() from the nltk package:", "Stop words are a list of words that we will remove before creating the vector. These are words that aren\u2019t directly adding value to our recommendation, such as \u201cus\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, etc. Sklearn has a nice pre-built list of stop words that we can use. Also, we\u2019ll remove words that are very common among our use-case and won\u2019t differentiate between projects, such as \u201ccovid19\u201d or \u201cpandemic\u201d. Here we combine the pre-built list with our hand-curated list specific to this dataset:", "Now we can build the vectorizer and run it on our list of projects. This created a large, sparse matrix which is vectorizing each bag-of-words in our dataset:", "To recommend projects, we will take in a set of languages and keywords, turn that into a bag-of-words, and find the most similar repositories using their bag of words. First, we\u2019ll let\u2019s check out the code, and then we can break it down:", "To turn this recommendation function into a form that can be deployed (we\u2019ll cover this more in a minute), we are going to utilize MLflow\u2019s pyfunc class. We need to create a class that has all of the necessary inputs for our prediction, and then runs the prediction and returns the result in the correct format:", "We can now test out our new class. We can create an object based on the class, with all of our inputs, and make sure the output populates as expected:", "You should see a dictionary-formatted DataFrame \u2014 nice!", "Before we go setting this up, let\u2019s have a quick chat about MLflow. Officially, MLflow is \u201cAn open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle.\u201d Databricks developed this open source project to help machine learning builders more easily manage and deploy machine learning models. Let\u2019s break that down:", "Managing models: While building an ML model, you will likely go through multiple iterations and test a variety of model types. It\u2019s important to keep track of metadata about those tests as well as the model objects themselves. What if you discover an awesome model on your 2nd of 100 tries and want to go back to use that? MLflow has you covered!", "Deploying models: In order to make a model accessible, you need to deploy the model. This means hosting your model as an API endpoint, so that it is easy to reference and score against your model in a standard way. There is a super long list of tools that deploy models for you. MLflow isn\u2019t actually one of those tools. Instead, MLflow allows easy deployment of your managed model to a variety of different tools. It could be on your local machine, Microsoft Azure, or AWS Sagemaker. We will use Sagemaker in this tutorial.", "The MLflow tracking server is a nice UI and API that wraps around the important features. We will need to set this up before we can use MLflow to start managing and deploying models.", "Make sure you have the MLflow package installed (check out the Pre-reqs if not!). From there, run the following command in your terminal:", "After this, you should see the shiny new UI running at http://localhost:5000/", "If you run into issues getting this setup, check out the MLflow tracking server docs here. Also, if you\u2019d prefer not to setup the tracking server on your own machine, Databricks offers a free hosted version as well.", "Since we already created the pyfunc class for our model, we can go ahead and push this model object to MLflow. To do that, we need to first point Python to our tracking server and then setup an experiment. An experiment is a collection of models inside of the MLflow tracking server.", "Before we send the model object to MLflow, we need to setup the Anaconda environment that will be used when the model runs on Sagemaker. In this case, we need to utilize both the default Anaconda, as well as conda-forge. The reason for using conda-forgeis so that we can also download the nltk_data alongside our nltk package. Normally, you can download the data within the script, but in this case, we need to make sure that data is stored alongside the package for use when we deploy the model. More details on nltk_data can be found here. Also, for more information about Anaconda, here\u2019s a detailed overview.", "Now, we can go ahead and log the model to MLflow. We use this command to send the class that we created, as well as all of the inputs to that class. This ensures everything needed to run the model is all packaged up together.", "Before we move on to deployment, we\u2019ll want to test deploying the model locally. This allows us to understand any errors that might pop up, before having to go through the process of actually creating the endpoint (which can take a while). Luckily, MLflow has a nice local emulator for Sagemaker: the mlflow sagemaker run-local command. We setup a little helper function so you can copy and paste the run-local script directly into your terminal:", "Once you\u2019ve run that in your terminal (it might take a minute), you can test the local endpoint to make sure it is operating as expected. First, we setup a function to easily call the endpoint, and then we pass in our DataFrame, in a JSON orientation:", "You should see the same result as you did when you tested the class earlier on! If you run into an error, head over to your terminal and you should see the stack trace so you can debug.", "Sagemaker is a suite of tools that Amazon Web Services (AWS) created to support Machine Learning development and deployment. There\u2019s a ton of tools available within Sagemaker (too many to list here) and we will be using their model deployment tool specifically. There are some great Sagemaker examples in their GitHub repo here.", "First things first, you need to get permissions worked out. AWS permissions are never simple, but we will try to keep this easy! You\u2019ll need to setup two different settings: a user for yourself and a role for Sagemaker.", "The first is a user account so that you can access AWS as you send the model to Sagemaker. To do this, you\u2019ll need to head over to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console and setup a user account with Administrator permissions. If your security team pushes back, \u201cSagemaker Full Access\u201d should work too! At the end of the setup flow, you\u2019ll be given an AWS Access Key ID and a AWS Secret Access Key. Make sure to save those! They are not accessible after that first time. Now, head to your terminal and type aws configure. This will prompt you to enter your AWS keys that you just collected. Once you have that setup, you\u2019ll now have AWS access from both the terminal and from Python! Here are more details from AWS.", "The second is a role (which is essentially a user account for services within AWS) for Sagemaker. To set this up, head to the roles section of IAM. You\u2019ll want to assign this role to Sagemaker and then pick the policy called \u201cSagemakerFullAccess.\u201d At the end of this process, you\u2019ll get something called an ARN for this role! We\u2019ll need this for deployment so keep this handy. More details from AWS here.", "Finally, we need to push an MLflow docker container into AWS. Assuming you have the permissions setup correctly above and docker installed (see prerequisites section for docker setup), you\u2019ll want to run the following command in your terminal:", "This will push a docker container into AWS, which will be used during deployment.", "Now that we have everything setup, it\u2019s time to push our model to Sagemaker!", "The deploy function usually takes a 5 to 10 minutes to complete and the status is checked every so often with this function until completion. Once the deployment is complete, you\u2019ll be able to find a model listed in the Sagemaker UI.", "Woot woot, your model is deployed! Our next step is to make sure the recommendations can be accessed by anyone, easily. We want anyone to be able to select preferred languages and keywords and then see a few recommended repos. There are a few options on how to move forward from here:", "At this point, we were anxious to get the model in the hands of users as fast as possible. We created Booklet.ai to make this last step of building a web app quick and easy.", "Booklet creates a web app for your ML model without any code changes or extra libraries to install. Here\u2019s an overview of how Booklet works:", "Booklet is free to use for your first ML Web App. Head over to the signup page to create an account.", "You\u2019ll also need to grant read-only access to a limited number of Sagemaker actions via an IAM role that is associated with our AWS account. Here are the steps:", "With the AWS Role created and the ARN on your clipboard, we\u2019re almost there. In the Booklet.ai settings, paste in the AWS Role ARN and click the \u201cSave\u201d button:", "Click the \u201cNew Model\u201d button within Booklet.ai and choose the Sagemaker endpoint you\u2019d like to wrap in a responsive web app. On this screen you can also configure a friendly model name for display and a description. We need to setup two quick configurations to get the demo ready:", "Feature Schema: This configures the inputs that users will send to your ML model. In this case, we want to setup two different fields: one multi-select text field for Programming Language, and one multi-select text field for key words. You can see how we structured this below:", "Post-Processing: This configures how the output should be displayed to the users. Booklet uses Nunjucks, a simple Javascript templating language, for this section. In the editing panel, you can reference the structure of the model results (populated from the defaults in the feature schema) and also see your edited output update in real-time.", "For this model, we want the results to look like a list of Github repos, so we\u2019ve configured the Nunjucks template in that way:", "Once you\u2019ve filled out both of these configurations, go ahead and click \u201cUpdate Model.\u201d", "Your web app is ready for use!", "Right now, your model is only accessible to those that are within your org in Booklet. You can also make your model easy to share by heading back into settings and setting your model to public (alongside an easy-to-use URL) so that anyone can access your model.", "In this tutorial, you\u2019ve learned how to go from a raw dataset in Github, all the way to a functioning web app. Thanks for following along!
