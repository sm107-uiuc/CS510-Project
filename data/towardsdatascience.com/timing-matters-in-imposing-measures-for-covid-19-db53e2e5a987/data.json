At a certain point of time, governments normally implement a certain type of measures and policies in order to save lives and livelihood. These measures include testing, tracing, increasing the capacity of the health system, lockdown and travel restrictions, and many more. In this article, we study a group of countries to see how they are performing in controlling the spread of the virus with the timing of various measures they used.", "Continuing from our previous work, we included the countries that have more confirmed cases than Australia in this study. As of 12 Jun 2020, there are 64 countries that have more confirmed cases and their measures data are available. As a result, these 64 countries are to be explored in this study and their confirmed cases as of 12th Jun are shown in Fig 1 below.", "We used 2 sets of data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDE).", "A group of 33 measures are presented among the countries in this study, and they range from \u201cstrengthening the public health system\u201d to \u201cpartial lockdown\u201d, and many others. Each measure is scaled to [0,1] based on the timing of each specific measure used by a country. From the day of the 1st case reported in a country, if a measure was not used, then the measure is recorded as 0. The earlier a measure was introduced by a country, the higher value (closer to 1) that specific measure is recorded. A heatmap based on Pearson correlation coefficient is shown in Fig 2 below.", "Above heatmap shows that there are strong correlations between \u201cstrengthening the public health system\u201d and \u201ceconomic measures\u201d, and strong correlation between \u201cgeneral recommendations\u201d and \u201ctesting policy\u201d. It also indicates the correlation between \u201cpartial lock down\u201d and \u201cdomestic travel restrictions\u201d. We can interpret as these measures are often used together. \u201cTesting policy\u201d is completely independent with no correlation to \u201cborder checks\u201d across all these studied countries.", "After the investigation on correlations between 33 measures, a set of 28 principle components were obtained from the dimension reduction. We used K-means clustering and a silhouette score to derive a group of 6 Clusters from the 64 countries\u2019 measures.", "Different measures have been introduced at different time after the 1st case appeared in each country. All these 64 countries have been assigned a cluster number based on their characteristics in the timing of measures used. As demonstrated in a heatmap in Fig 3 below, if a measure is introduced early, the metric is darker which is closer to 1 on the scale of [0,1]. The later of a measure used by a group of countries, the lighter colour shown in the heatmap.", "For example, \u201cLimited gathering\u201d is a measure used across all countries in an early stage after COVID-19 cases started in these countries. On the contrary, \u201cLockdown of refugee\u201d and \u201cMass population testing\u201d are the measures introduced late across these countries included in this study.", "This group of 14 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, Philippines, and South Africa. The characteristics of measures used by these countries are:", "The 7-day rolling average of daily confirmed cases for this group of countries are shown in Fig 4. Among these 14 countries, there are 11 countries including Australia have (or almost have) flattened the curve. Most of these countries have also seen big reduction of the cases from the peak to the latest status. Australia has successfully flattered the curve with multiple measures introduced by the government in an early stage.", "This group contains 18 countries in Fig 5 below. The commonality of these countries in imposing measures are 2 folds referring to Fig 3.", "From the 7-days moving average of the number of cases as shown in Fig 5 below, most of these countries except Ireland, Israel and Ecuador who have flattered the curve, most countries haven\u2019t flatten the curve with the measures imposed patterned as \u201cearly or late\u201d.", "This group contains 33 countries. Referring to the timing of all these 33 measures used by these countries, we can see that most of the measures were introduced to the countries at a fairly late or moderately late stage compared to other countries with one exception of \u201cSchool closure\u201d. From the 7-days moving average of the number of cases as shown in Fig 6 below, most of the countries are still on the rise with the number of positive cases. However, China, South Korea, Canada, Netherlands, UK are included in this group who have successfully controlled the first wave, and it tells that there are certainly more dimensions we need to look into these measures in addition to the timing of introduction.", "Different countries imposed different measures at different points of time in order to control the spread of infection. Based on the timing of these measures, we have grouped countries to identify specific patterns among these 64 countries. It is very clear that the earlier for measures to be introduced, the more impact they can produce in controlling the spread of the disease:", "\u201cTiming matters! The earlier the better\u201d", "However, this study also highlighted that timing is very limited in generating enough impact. We need to look into how effective each measure is in controlling the spread of COVID19, so countries can adapt a more effective strategy for short term and long term management by understanding more:", "\u201cMeasures have different effectiveness in reducing transmission!\u201d", "Feel free to access the GitHub repo, and we welcome your feedback and comments.", "Your home for data science.
