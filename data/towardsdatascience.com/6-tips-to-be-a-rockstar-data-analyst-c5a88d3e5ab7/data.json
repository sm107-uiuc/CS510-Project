What are the sales in 2019 by month? Which website generated the best CTR by country?", "You are not doing analysis unless you understand what are the main questions. You are known who asks questions to clarify the motive and purpose behind any request. You want to know the dimensions of the analysis, which brands, what time range, which category \u2014 you are getting all answers that you need to start your analysis. You communicate, ask, and ask and you are getting clarification, you are finding solutions.", "You know that you have less than 1 minute to explain the point.", "This is the same as saying \u2018less is more\u2019. You know that no one likes long emails and no one likes long speeches. You are focusing on what is the purpose of your analyzes and share always the main insights. If there is a space you complement sub-points but your focus is on the main purpose and the main findings.", "You do not publish any report without double confirmation or even triple confirmation. There have been times when I ignored quality for the sake of doing my job fast. I was running reports and analysis at a rocket speed that even I was surprised, but! rockstar data analysts do it differently. You know that you are the first source of data. You are a person who goes first to data, makes insight, and spreads it. You know that if the numbers you shared are wrong, people will not trust you anymore. You always prioritize quality over speed, it is better to spend more time and make it correct than do analysis and not be sure that it is correct.", "Marketing matters, you give the structure to your analyses. You love bullet points and summary. Whether you are sharing your insight via email or teleconference you are a rockstar data analyst because you make it peachy, delicious to read, and to listen. You have your favorite font, you care about the colors, typos, and all little details that make your message stand out.", "People tend to see problems but you propose solutions. When you see that the data is leaking, the report is broken, stakeholders delay the answer, then you are getting to the root and try to solve it! From every corner of the company you hear people talking that something is broken, something is not working. But you are thinking about solutions because you are a rockstar. People want solutions not problems. Your mind is \u201chow to solve\u201d but not like \u201cthere is a problem\u201d.", "The truth is the definition of your work. You do not hide facts, data, bad news. It is not your way. You say what is broken, what is wrong, what is leaking, and what is missing. You never hide the truth. Without exception. When you make mistakes you take ownership of those mistakes, you always explain what mislead you and how you will avoid them in the future. You are honest. You know that trust is based on truth.", "To sum up, rockstar data analysts ask the right questions, know the purpose and share main insights, prefer quality but not forgetting speed, know that the design of delivery matters, prefer solutions over problems, and always speak and write the truth.", "Your home for data science.
