These are all very important sources of information and we are lucky to have access to such a vast and free knowledge resource.", "However, sometimes you just need to take a step back and focus on basics by learning, sharing and hence growing it. This article is exactly about that. A very basic and simplistic approach to Plotly visualization using COVID-19 data that I am sharing as part of my stay-at-home Easter break project! As once a mentor of mine said to me:\u201c\u2026if you want to never stop learning, try to teach what you know\u2026\u201d", "Here I will share only two things, firstly, the basic coding used for plotting and secondly, reference to documentation so you can go and experiment.", "Before I go into the coding part, I just want to clarify that this article is only intended as an educational project. Therefore, I have not tried at all to calculate any mortality, growth or survival rates of the pandemic. As we are all in this together, so it is very important that this kind of sensitive information is calculated and shared with great caution and best handled using appropriate knowledge of the field. Please refer to authentic sources of information for any point of views or information about COVID-19.", "Simply put, \u201cPlotly is an interactive, open-source and browser-based graphing library for Python\u201d. It comes with various cool looking chart types (bar, line scatter, geo map etc.) and I personally found it very user friendly and have plenty of easy to understand documentation. Strongly encourage you to go through it when building any code on https://plotly.com/python/.", "I used COVID-19 cases data from https://data.humdata.org/ and is compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE). Using various techniques the data is simplified into below columns. Please do note that I am assuming a basic Python skills for this.", "In the above data x=Dates, y=infected, z= deaths, w= recovered. Now y-z-w gives us active cases as well just for demonstration on bar chart for this article.", "We used go.figure() function (imported as \u2018go\u2019 normally) to call graphing object in Plotly. Within Plotly graph objects we may divide it into two categories: Traces and Layout. There are then further attributes within both Traces and Layout that define our chart. Do refer https://plotly.com/python/reference/ for list of all attributes and then play around with those.", "To overlay bar charts, I used the go.figure() function from Plotly to call chart objects and then added further bar traces (for each column in my data ) and layered them over the charts:", "An interactive plotly chart. Please do note if you change the trace type in the code above you can add lines, scatter etc. on the same plot.", "To analyse a daily change in number of cases I simply used a diff() function on the cumulative data above. Now in order to demonstrate it differently, the \u2018Line\u2019 trace is used in this one:", "An interactive line chart with various options to analyse.", "One of the coolest feature that made me a fan of Plotly is its easy to use animation. You really don\u2019t have to do a lot of coding to animate a simple map like the one shared above in the video. There is a number of built-in features that you can explore through the documentation.", "For this one, I imported Plotly Express (as \u201cpx\u201d) which is an interface that comes with plotly. This works on what they call \u201ctidy\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d data and works with Pandas dataframe, lists, numpy arrays, pandas series etc.", "Again the basic principle of graph objects and then layout remains the same. However, in this case, the layout attributes are defined in detail further down the configuration and can be changed. Please refer https://plotly.com/python/reference/#layout-sliders and play around with different attributes to see how it changes the map.", "The video shared above is basically a time lapse of Covid-19 spread using the narrow data form from the same JHU CCSE data source I shared above.", "As you can see above, I have played around the Sliders\u2019 x and y positioning to improvise the Date (i.e. Current value) overlapping on the chart.", "Hope you liked the brief overview of Plotly and how you can create some simple but cool looking charts using it.", "Your home for data science.
