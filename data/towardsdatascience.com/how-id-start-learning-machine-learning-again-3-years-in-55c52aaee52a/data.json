Half of me was concerned about having to pay $19 for breakfast (unless it\u2019s Christmas, driving Uber on the weekends isn\u2019t very lucrative), the other half about whether any of this study I\u2019d been doing online meant anything.", "In 2017, I left Apple, tried to build a web startup, failed, discovered machine learning, fell in love, signed up to a deep learning course with zero coding experience, emailed the support team asking what the refund policy was, didn\u2019t get a refund, spent the next 3-months handing in the assignments four to six days late, somehow passed, decided to keep going and created my own AI Masters Degree.", "9-months into my AI Masters Degree, I met Mike, we had coffee, I told him my grand plan; use AI to help the world move more and eat better, he told me I should I meet Cam, I met Cam, I told Cam I\u2019m going to the US, he said why not stay here, come in on Thursday, okay, went in on Thursday for a 1-day a week internship and two weeks later was offered a role as a junior machine learning engineer at Max Kelsen.", "14-months into my machine learning engineer role, I decided to leave and try it on my own. I wrote an article about what I\u2019d learned, Andrei found it, emailed me asking if I wanted to build a beginner-friendly machine learning course, I said yes, we built the course and 6-months in we\u2019ve got the privilege of teaching 27,177 students in 150+ countries.", "Add it up and you get about 3-years.

That\u2019s the thing with knowledge.", "But enough about me. That\u2019s my story.

And if you remember the material, it\u2019s because they sparked a fire in you enough for it to be burned into your memory.", "Dabble in a few resources, you\u2019re smart enough to find the best ones.

A classic cart before the horse scenario.", "A chef\u2019s entire work centres around two tools, the controlled use of fire and a knife.", "This is embodied in the best programming advice I\u2019ve ever received: learn the language, not the framework.", "If you\u2019re just starting out and can\u2019t count the number of tools you\u2019re learning on one hand, you\u2019re trying to use too many.", "If you want to build things, such as web applications or mobile applications, learn software engineering before (or at least alongside) machine learning.", "Too many models live and die within Jupyter Notebooks.", "Because machine learning is an infrastructure problem (infrastructure means all the things which go around your model so others can use it, the hot new term you\u2019ll want to lookup is MLOps).", "And deployment, as in getting your models into the hands of others, is hard.", "But that\u2019s exactly why I should\u2019ve spent more time there.", "If I was starting again today, I\u2019d find a way to deploy every semi-decent model I build (with exceptions for the dozens of experiments leading to the one worth sharing).", "Don\u2019t be afraid to make something simple. A basic front-end which someone can interact with is far more interesting than a notebook in a GitHub repo.", "Train a model, build a front-end application around it with Streamlit, get the application working locally (on your computer), once it\u2019s working wrap the application with Docker, then deploy the Docker container to Heroku or another cloud provider.", "Sure, we\u2019re going against the rule here of using a few too many tools, but pulling this off a few times will get you thinking about what it\u2019s like to get your machine learning model into people\u2019s hands.", "Deploying your models will raise the questions you don\u2019t get to ask when your machine learning model lives its life in a Jupyter Notebook, like:", "Building things becomes research. You\u2019ll want your models to work faster, better. To achieve this, you\u2019ll need to research alternative ways of doing things.

I\u2019m going to be spending the next month or two reading it cover to cover. Having read the free text online it\u2019s more than enough to cover the fundamentals.", "I\u2019ve got online course certificates coming out of my ass.", "I got caught thinking more certificates equals more skills.", "I\u2019d burn through lectures on 1.75x speed just to get to the end, pass the automated exam and share my progress online.", "I optimised for completing courses instead of creating skills. Because watching someone else explain it was easier than learning how to do it myself.", "Here\u2019s the thing. Everything I learned for an exam, I\u2019ve forgotten. Everything I learned through experimenting, I remember.", "Now, this isn\u2019t to say online certifications and courses aren\u2019t worth your time. Courses help to build foundational skills. But working on your own projects helps to build specific knowledge (knowledge which can\u2019t be taught).", "Learning (anything) isn\u2019t linear, better to read the same book twice (as long as it\u2019s got some substance) than to add more to the pile.", "I often tell my students, despite the immense proudness I feel when I see someone share a graduation certificate, I\u2019d prefer them not to finish my course and instead take the parts they need and use them for their own work.", "Before you add something, ask yourself, \u201chave I sucked the juice out of what I\u2019ve already covered?\u201d", "First of all, more important than any resource is to get rid of the \u201cI can\u2019t learn it\u201d mentality. That\u2019s bullsh*t. You\u2019ve got the internet. You can learn anything.", "The internet has given rise to a new kind of hunter-gatherer. And if you decide to take on the challenge you can gather resources to create your own path.", "The following path isn\u2019t set either. It\u2019s designed to be a compass rather than a map. And guess what? It\u2019s all accessible online.", "If I was starting again I\u2019d learn far more software engineering practices intertwined with machine learning.", "My main goal would be to build more things people could interact with.", "The machine learning specific parts would be:", "There\u2019s a lot here. So to consolidate my knowledge I\u2019d build 1\u20132 milestone projects using Streamlit or the web development skills I\u2019d learned from freeCodeCamp. And of course, these would be shared on GitHub.", "Once I\u2019d gotten some foundational machine learning skills, I\u2019d build upon them with the following.", "Again, after going through these, I\u2019d consolidate my knowledge by building a project people can interact with.", "An example would be a web application powered by a machine learning model.", "Two of the biggest things you pay for with a college degree is accountability and structure.", "Good news is, you can get both of these yourself.", "I created my own AI Masters Degree as a form of accountability and structure. You can do something similar.", "In fact, if I was starting again, I\u2019d follow something more similar to Jason Benn\u2019s How I learned web development, software engineering & ML. It\u2019s similar to mine but includes more software engineering practices.", "If you can find a (small) community to learn with others, that\u2019s a big bonus. I\u2019m still not quite sure how to do this.", "A billion dollar idea is to develop a platform where people can create their own self-driven curriculums and interact with others who are on similar paths. I say self-driven here because all knowledge is largely self-taught. Rather than hand-feed knowledge, the role of an instructor is instead more to excite, guide and challenge.", "Learning and reading is inhaling. Building and creating is exhaling. Don\u2019t hold your breath.", "Balance your consumption of materials with creations of your own.", "For example, you might spend 6 weeks learning, then 6 weeks putting your knowledge together in a form of shared work.", "Your shared work is your new resume.", "GitHub and your own blog. Use the other platforms when needed. For machine learning projects, a runnable Colab notebook is your minimum requirement.", "Everything here is biased by my own experience of graduating from a nutrition degree, spending 9-months studying machine learning in my bedroom whilst driving Uber on the weekends to pay for courses, getting a machine learning job, leaving the job and building a machine learning course.", "I have no experience of going to a coding bootcamp or university to learn technological skills so therefore can\u2019t compare the differences.", "Though, since we\u2019re talking about code and math, it either works or it doesn\u2019t. Knowing this, the contents of the materials you choose doesn\u2019t matter as much as how you learn it.", "I put together some clips from the last three years as well as riffed on a few points to go along with this article.
