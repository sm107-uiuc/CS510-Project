In response to this, Nibras Kazimi, one of my favorite Middle East follows, tweeted the following:", "For background, the U.S. dollar has become vital for Iraq\u2019s economy after the toppling of Saddam. To acquire these dollars, Iraq has an account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which draws on Iraqi oil reserves. The palettes of $100 bills are flown to Baghdad and held in the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). The CBI then sells these dollars in daily auctions to Iraqi and regional banks as well as larger money transfer firms in exchange for Iraqi dinars.", "Consequently, the auction over the years has become ripe for exploitation by everyone from Iran to the Islamic State, with the CBI actually \u201cblacklisting\u201d or barring from participation several Iranian banks and smaller money service businesses.", "It is assumed that under the JCPOA nuclear agreement Iran no longer needed the access to dollars that this auction provides, so Iranian exploitation dwindled. However, the U.S. announced that it would be withdrawing from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, and the pre-JCPOA sanctions regimes would be \u201csnapping back\u201d into place. The first round of snapback sanctions went into effect on August 6, 2018, and the full reimplementation happened on November 4. What Nibras is claiming in the above tweet is that, with the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran, the regime has returned to the Iraqi auction as a source of U.S. dollars.", "Therefore, I wanted to see if I could prove Nibras\u2019 claim by first scraping the daily auction data from the Central Bank of Iraq\u2019s website and then applying the Isolation Forest anomaly detection algorithm on the data to reveal anomalous auction sessions.", "The CBI\u2019s website provides several pieces of information following every auction. The first number (190,058,455) is the total sold for covering foreign accounts. The second number (35,900,000) is total cash sales, and the third (225,958,455) is total sales, i.e., the sum of the first two numbers. So it was these three numbers that I wanted to collect.", "Thankfully, the CBI\u2019s website posts these results on sequential URLs, meaning I just needed to find the range of URLs and loop through it.\u00b9 To scrape, I used BeautifulSoup and stored the data in CSV files. The HTML format of the pages changes rather frequently despite it not being especially noticeable when viewing the pages in a web browser. This required modifying the script to account for each change in page layout.", "To limit the number of different scripts and because I am most concerned with events following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran in 2018, I started with the auction held on September 18, 2017 (https://cbi.iq/currency_auction/view/124). The HTML layout for this page persisted until the September 18, 2018 auction. The page format for the results from this September 18, 2018 auction has (mostly) continued to the most recent auction (February 9, 2020 at the time of writing).", "After scraping, I performed some basic data cleaning and type conversion before visualizing.", "I used Bokeh to graph the amounts over time. Given the amount of missing data in the scraped \u201cgrand total\u201d field, I fabricated one by summing the first two amounts. A 7-day rolling average provides a smoother picture of the results.", "While it does seem like the auctioned amounts have generally increased, I was hopeful Isolation Forest would be able to identify specific abnormal auction sessions.", "Isolation Forest works by isolating datapoints by randomly selecting a feature and then partitioning a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Because this recursive partitioning can be represented in a tree structure, it follows that the number of splits required to isolate a given sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminal node. This path length, averaged over a forest of such trees, constitutes a measure of normality.", "The most anomalous observations will have the shortest paths from this random partitioning because they will \u201csplit off\u201d first. So when a forest of trees produces shorter path lengths for particular observations, those observations are likely to be anomalous. For an excellent, visualized overview, I recommend this video.", "Given that I have no labeled data in this instance, I used Isolation Forest in an unsupervised manner to produce anomaly scores for each datapoint. The resulting distribution of anomaly scores:", "Since I trained the model on only two features, it was fairly straightforward as to which points received the lowest anomaly scores (i.e., those that were most anomalous).", "Many of the sessions the model scored as most abnormal were because of low amounts in the total cash sales or total for foreign sales or both. Moreover, these \u201clight\u201d sessions seemed to all be due to their occurrence on Iraqi holidays.", "The most anomalous session, with a score of -0.232, occurred on January 6, 2020; January 6 is Army Day, a public holiday in Iraq. Similarly, July 14, 2019\u2019s session was the second-most anomalous session; July 14 is Republic Day, marking the 1958 overthrow of the monarchy.", "On the other end of the spectrum, both large cash sales sessions and large total for foreign sessions were scored as highly anomalous as well. The largest total cash auction in the dataset, April 16, 2018, was the eighth-most anomalous observation. It appears the high cash amount was primarily due to big purchases from Rasheed Bank and National Islamic Bank. Rasheed Bank is an Iraqi state bank, but there is no prominent news event that might be driving this large purchase.", "Another anomalous large cash session was May 15, 2018. It appears that Iraqi Middle East Investment Bank was the biggest buyer that day.\u2075 I quickly scanned for news related to the bank around that date but found nothing.", "It is also interesting that the session that had the largest total for foreign auction is only the 18th-most anomalous day. As the scatter plot shows, it seems large cash sessions are more anomalous than large foreign accounts ones.", "While it does appear there has been some uptick in total auction amounts, we should be wary of drawing too many conclusions.", "Firstly, this is the grand total for the entire auction, meaning that even if dollars heading to Iran were increasing significantly, it could be offset by decreases in purchases by other participants.", "The sample size here is not large (only 611 observations), and there is only one year\u2019s worth of data prior to sanctions reimplementation. All this made me wary of assuming I had a good baseline from which I could judge any change in auction amount.", "Isolation Forest reasonably identified particularly small and large auction sessions as most anomalous. Many of the sessions with the lowest amounts can be explained by national holidays; it is far less clear what is behind the largest auctions. Regardless, it did not help surface any ostensible potential Iranian exploitation of the auction.", "The static website for the project lives here; the repo for the project lives here.", "Your home for data science.
