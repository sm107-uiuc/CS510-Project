Other might add skills to the definition of intelligence. And yet others would claim intelligence is ability to acquire and apply that knowledge and those skills. I think the best definition of intelligence I\u2019ve seen is by Francois Chollet, deep learning researcher at Google, who essentially states that intelligence is the ability to efficiently learn skills and knowledge for new problems that have not been seen before. There\u2019s a few interesting things in that definition:", "Chollet has pioneered some fascinating work on the measurement of intelligence for artificial systems. He attempts to quantify the metrics and put forward an approach and some initial tests to quantify the efficient ability of a system to learn. Without such objective measurements, it\u2019s difficult to tell if we are progressing towards truly intelligent systems. This is a link to his paper On the Measure of Intelligence but this podcast has a nice dialog and overview as does this blog post. Additional such tests include the original Winograd Challenge and a revised Winogrande Challenge to better attempt to understand common sense reasoning.", "\u201cNeural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data.\u201d Here is a simple image to help visualize the concept:", "There are at least a few variations but the basic concept in machine learning (e.g. supervised machine learning) is that:", "A brief timeline: Inspired by the biology of the brain, neural networks were conceived in the 1940s, popularized in the late '60s and early \u201970s, resurged in the \u201980s, died in the \u201990s and rose again in the 2000s. They truly become useful in the last 10 years with the advent of deep learning \u2014 namely deep multi layer neural networks working to solve interesting problems like computer vision, speech recognition \u2014 and the availability of immense amounts of training data courtesy the internet and the vast increase in computing power that made those calculations and algorithms practical.", "While inspired by the brain and impressive in their accomplishments, the neural network and deep learning are still relatively simplistic. As we saw in the GPT-3 example, it can take a tremendous amount of data to train a system and the systems are only narrowly knowledgable and not flexible to learn another task.", "According to Gary Marcus, professor of psychology and AI at NYU, there are several such challenges with deep learning: data efficiency, transfer learning, hierarchical knowledge, open-ended inference, explainability, integrating prior knowledge, causal reasoning, modeling unstable world, and robustness.", "Fundamentally, these deep learning systems are set up for a narrow understanding at best. They are not robust to major changes of environment or slightly different tasks. They do not have common sense understanding. They do not have the ability to transfer learning from one task to another.", "When designing artificially intelligence system, still many individuals draw inspiration from how children learn. Children demonstrate incredible capabilities to learn and leverage a number of tools in tandem to do so efficiently. Jatindra Malik, Professor of AI at UC Berkeley, shared the following 6 things that AI can learn from children in this podcast and with reference to this paper:", "Children for example use multiple modalities to learn \u2014 that is they will see, touch, listen to their world around them and gather intelligence and knowledge about behaviors that way.", "They do this incrementally with little knowledge to begin with and adding scaffolding and new knowledge into the structures as they experience them.", "When you drop a glass, you can hear it break. And so things that look like glass are generally fragile. Multiple modalities \u2014 incorporating vision and hearing for example \u2014 and incremental learning could be important constructs to accelerate the learning of AI systems.", "Children also explore and play with the world around them. They will try things. If something doesn\u2019t work they can keep experimenting or something they will have a helpful more experienced person around (e.g. parent) that will correct them or teach them; that is the nature of the social world they live in and that could be useful for AI. The idea of trying something out \u2014 rather than feeding bunches of static historic or labeled data \u2014 is an interesting way to think about learning, to interact with the world and perhaps more efficiently accelerate our learning about it.", "This TED Talk from Gary Marcus on \u201cWhy Toddlers are Smarter Than Computers\u201d explains exactly these concepts:", "Reinforcement learning is a related technique in machine learning that can be less reliant on training data and more on accomplishing a goal and self-play. This technique was used to wide acclaim in the AlphaGo project that successfully defeated the world champion at Go. AlphaGo learned to play Go by playing the game millions of times by itself and learning which strategies worked and didn\u2019t. While not yet efficient and not fully transferrable, these concepts seem promising. If you haven\u2019t already, I highly recommend the AlphaGo documentary \u2014 I was both inspired by the ingenuity of the team that created the system and conflicted in watching a human lose to that very machine.", "And to conclude the last 2 areas where AI can learn from the brain with direct quotes from the Smith and Gasser paper:", "Babies live in a physical world, full of rich regularities that organize perception, action, and ultimately thought. The intelligence of babies resides not just inside themselves but is distributed across their interactions and experiences in the physical world. The physical world serves to bootstrap higher mental functions.", "Babies learn a language, a shared communicative system that is symbolic. And this changes everything, enabling children to form even higher-level and more abstract distinctions.", "In summary, there are a number of aspects of the ways humans learn \u2014 socially, incrementally, through multiple modalities \u2014 that AI\u2019s can take inspiration from to achieve true intelligence in the sense of efficiently learning wholly new tasks.", "While AI research can benefit and progress from studying individual human learning, what can AI learn form society as a whole? If you take a baby today and a baby from 10,000 years ago they are biologically very similar YET today\u2019s baby will learn substantially more and perhaps much faster than his/her biological ancestor. Why? Yes there is more information available today, but how is that information encoded beyond books and wikipedia? How do we transfer such common sense and cultural learning? The notion of learning socially, encoding customs, behaviors, and perhaps even values is an interesting concept and it will be interesting to observe how do we model culture and interdependence into autonomous agents of the future.", "There is incredible progress and developments in machine learning today \u2014 fueled by more data, faster computing, and better algorithms and architectures. Yet still, we are far away from a general theory of intelligence and learning and still have much to learn and gain from understanding our biological learning system. I\u2019m encouraged, excited, and highly optimistic about the multi-disciplinary learning between cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science and the prospects of improving our own biological \u2014 as well as advancing artificial \u2014 intelligence.", "This article is part of series of posts about the brain.
