That means that we can\u2019t choose being culture-less creatures. We are born and that\u2019s it, you are already there. You can\u2019t choose your status, parents, city and more. Then we learn, from life and from school, our friends, our family.", "That process creates a way of seeing things, a way of thinking about the world, about ourselves and what surrounds us. Our senses open us to the world, we hear, we feel, we taste, we see. When I mention \u201cseeing beyond\u201d or something like that I mean the combination of all of our senses, what we perceive from every angle.", "We get the data from the \u201coutside world\u201d and our body and brain analyze the raw data we got, and then we \u201cinterpret\u201d things.", "What is this \u201cinterpretation\u201d? Just what we\u2019ve learned about how to react, think, feel and understand from the information we are getting. When we are understanding we are decoding the parts that forms this complex thing, and transforming the raw data we got in the beginning into something useful and simple.", "We do this by modeling. This is the process of understanding the \u201creality\u201d, the world around us, but creating a higher level prototype that will describe the things we are seeing, hearing and feeling, but it\u2019s a representative thing, not the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201creal\u201d thing.", "We don\u2019t stay there. Our model of the world, or a process, has another part. What we think that particular thing means and how we feel about it.", "When I was younger I had a lot of prejudice about lots and lots of things. Judging things and people before even meeting them. And I don\u2019t think I was alone in this.", "We are used to jump to conclusions really fast, not analyzing every side of things. We are use to see what our eyes are seeing and \u201ctrusting our gut\u201d.", "Sadly the common sense that reigns in our culture is Aristotelian and Medieval (\u00c9tudes d\u2019histoire de la pens\u00e9e scientifique \u2014 Alexander Koyr\u00e9). That means that intuition fails a lot of times when trying to understand the world, also this \u201ccommon sense\u201d comes sometimes with judgement, something that creates a bias in the way we see things.", "Going and seeing beyond in this context means going a step forward, putting your judgment, common sense and intuition aside and really analyzing a situation. We should be doing this for everything that happens around us, question ourselves if the thing you are doing, thinking and perceiving is actually correct. This is something very close to the Cartesian Doubt.", "Agility is fundamental to business\u2019 ability to successfully build systems in a world where it\u2019s difficult to predict the future \u2014 James Kobielus.", "So what does Data Science have to do with any of this? Actually going further, and beyond our common sense and intuition is the only way of solving complex business problems.", "In a world full of intuitive models, disruption and advancement come from going beyond, using data to understand what can not be seen with the naked eye or with an \u201cexpert look\u201d.", "The process of an Agile Data Science Workflow proposed by Russell Jurney is an amazing way of understanding how and why Data Science together with agility helps us going beyond, seeing more and solving problems in a creative way.", "The manifesto for Agile Data Science (we should put agile data science workflow here) leads us to this. Iterating, over and over again, rethinking the business process and needs, experimenting a lot, listening what the data has to say, understanding and encouraging the business to understand that the data\u2019s opinion must always be included in product discussions, finding a critical path to solve the problem and then organizing the team around completing it, and going further, letting the models solve the problems, of course using our expertise to help them, but not biasing them.", "From understanding the business and its needs to the deployment of the solution we need to take a look at the bigger picture, from above, from below, from the side. Emptying our minds from the intuition that everyone can add to the solution, and trust what our models are saying about the process and understanding how it is solving the problem.", "As a final note I would like to remember and state that every model assumes things, and here model can mean a way of understanding how the world works to a Random Forest classifier to see if a transaction will be fraudulent or not. We need to understand this assumptions, they may not be clear in the beginning but they are there. In Machine Learning and Deep Learning is easier to see what are these assumptions, they are in the papers that proposed the algorithm and also in the codes, so before using a ML or DL library to import a model, understand what it assumes from the data and the process, that will make the \u201cdebug\u201d so much easier.", "Thanks for reading this.
