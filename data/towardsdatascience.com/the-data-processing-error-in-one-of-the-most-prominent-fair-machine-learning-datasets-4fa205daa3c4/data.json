The data error I identify affects quite substantially several of the more fundamental aspects of those key sub-datasets, such as the sample size, the number of recidivists, and the recidivism rate. I estimate that the recidivism rate is biased upward by almost 25%.", "Despite this, interestingly, the non-trivial data processing error I discover has little impact on the most high-profile result reported by ProPublica using the same sub-datasets. Namely, the false positive and false negative rates for African-Americans versus Caucasians.", "COMPAS and similar risk prediction scores are sometimes used to aide various decisions in the judicial system, such as those regarding bail and pretrial detention, sentencing, and probation and parole (Cowgill 2018 and James 2018).", "Based on its analysis, focusing on one set of predictive metrics, ProPublica concluded that the COMPAS recidivism risk score was biased against African-Americans. The company that developed the COMPAS risk scoring system, Northpointe Inc., using the same data but focusing on a different set of predictive metrics, defended the risk scores as unbiased.", "Due to the controversial nature of the topic and results, as well as the public availability of the data, ProPublica\u2019s trailblazing work of investigative journalism fueled intense debate and research in the nascent field of fair machine learning or algorithmic fairness.", "ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS score and recidivism data have become perhaps the most prominent benchmarking data used by researchers to test new or existing algorithmic fairness definitions and procedures. (See Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018 and the additional references I include below; or one of several Medium blog posts)", "While ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS data are used in an increasing number of studies, researchers have generally taken the datasets created by ProPublica as they are and do not appear to have scrutinized them for data processing issues. Instead of testing a novel fairness definition or procedure, I take a closer look at the actual datasets put together by ProPublica", "In particular, I examine the sub-datasets ProPublica built to study recidivism within a two-year window after a defendant\u2019s original arrest in the data. Doing so, I find that ProPublica made a substantial data processing error when it constructed these two-year recidivism datasets.", "As I show below, ProPublica failed to implement a two-year window sample cutoff for recidivists (whereas it did implement such a sample cutoff for non-recidivists)", "As a result, ProPublica incorrectly kept a disproportionate share of recidivists in the two-year datasets. I estimate this biases the two-year general recidivism rate upward by approximately nine percentage points, pushing it from 36% to 45%.", "The two-year recidivism rate ProPublica calculates is therefore about 25% higher than the true two-year recidivism rate in that same data when it is processed correctly.", "In my research paper, I also explore how this data processing error impacts other statistics. Specifically, I look at ProPublica\u2019s confusion matrix analysis of High/Low COMPAS scores vs. two-year recidivism status. I find that the biased two-year datasets also have a substantial effect on the positive predictive value (or precision) and the negative predictive value.", "On the other hand, the biased two-year datasets have relatively little impact on several other key statistics in the confusion matrix analysis, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative share of recidivists versus non-recidivists. In particular, the accuracy, false positive rate, and false negative rate.", "ProPublica\u2019s key finding of a higher false positive rate and lower false negative rate for African-Americans compared to Caucasians, therefore, does not change when one processes the data correctly.\u00b9", "To my knowledge, this is the first endeavor to highlight the data processing error mentioned above. In this blog post, I summarize my research paper.", "(If you would like to read an even shorter summary, see my short version of this blog post. I have also created a GitHub repository with the R program I wrote to analyze the data)", "In 2016, a team of journalists from ProPublica obtained a dataset of more than 11 thousand pretrial defendants from Broward County, FL, who had been arrested and assessed with the COMPAS screening system between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. (The COMPAS screening survey is completed by pretrial services in cooperation with the defendant after his or her arrest)", "ProPublica then collected data on future arrests through the end of March 2016 to study how well the COMPAS risk score predicted recidivism by these defendants (and published its article in May 2016). (ProPublica\u2019s data and analysis are described here)", "ProPublica\u2019s investigation was truly groundbreaking. It used public records requests to obtain COMPAS scores, screening dates, and personal information on a group of defendants, as well as prison and jail information for them. It then matched and merged these disparate data sources.", "ProPublica obtained criminal history information after the COMPAS screen date for this sample of pretrial defendants from public criminal records on the Broward County Clerk\u2019s Office website through the end of March 2016. (It also obtained public jail and incarceration records from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Florida Department of Corrections website)", "ProPublica collected the data for its study and created a database. From that database, it constructed several sub-datasets that merged and calculated various features. For example, an indicator variable for a re-arrest for a new crime within two years of the original offense. ProPublica then exported these sub-datasets into .csv files. These files are the ones most often used by other researchers. (Again, ProPublica\u2019s data on the Web is available here)", "I primarily use two of the .csv files that ProPublica created, namely, the compas-scores.csv and compas-scores-two-years.csv. The first csv file contains the full dataset of pretrial defendants that ProPublica obtained from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. This file contains over 11 thousand pretrial defendants, who are then trimmed down by ProPublica to 10,331 defendants, due in part to data quality issues, as I describe in my research paper. (I still refer to this slightly trimmed down dataset as the full dataset)", "The second csv file listed above is a file that ProPublica created specifically to study two-year general recidivism. The term general recidivism is used to distinguish it from the smaller subset of violent recidivism. General recidivism includes both violent and non-violent offenses. I focus on the two-year general recidivism dataset in this post, but the two-year violent recidivism dataset created by ProPublica suffers from the same data processing issue I identify here.", "This two-year recidivism file contains, in theory, a subset of people observed for at least two years, and ProPublica tags people in this file who recidivated within two years as having a two_year_recid indicator flag turned on. ProPublica\u2019s two-year general recidivism csv file contains 7,214 people.", "I start by looking at the full dataset of 10,331 defendants. I do a histogram with the number of cases or arrests by COMPAS screening date (which is typically performed the day of, or one day after, the arrest). To see the data processing error clearly, I do separate COMPAS screen date histograms for recidivists vs. non-recidivists.", "I use 7-day (i.e., week-long) data bins for these and the subsequent histograms. For (later) reference, I draw a red vertical line on April 1, 2014, which is the two-year mark prior to the end of ProPublica\u2019s criminal records data collection window (in late March 2016).", "First, for the full dataset, other than an unrelated, but very noticeable, drop in COMPAS screen dates in mid-2013 (for recidivists and non-recidivists alike), the Figure below appears reasonable.", "It is not clear why there is a drop in COMPAS screens or cases in mid-2013. To the extent this is a problem, it appears to be a problem with the original dataset that ProPublica received from Broward County since it is also evident in ProPublica\u2019s compas-scores-raw.csv dataset. So this does not appear to be a data processing mistake by ProPublica, and I do not address this issue in this post or my paper.", "To construct the two-year recidivism datasets, ProPublica presumably wanted to keep people observed for at least two years at the end of the time window for which it collected criminal records data in late March 2016. We should not have expected, therefore, to see any defendants in the two-year datasets with COMPAS screening (or arrest) dates after April 1, 2014. (That is, people observed for less than two years prior to the end date for the criminal records data that ProPublica collected).", "However, as I show in the next Figure, there are many people (in particular recidivists) in the two-year dataset who do indeed have a COMPAS screening (or arrest) date after this potential cutoff. They have COMPAS screen dates all the way through December 31, 2014, which is the last possible date for the original arrest and COMPAS screening in ProPublica\u2019s database.", "The reason for this is that to create the two-year dataset, ProPublica used the following logic:", "Here is the Python code that ProPublica used (lifetime of 730 days is used for the two-year mark):", "The second line of this code guarantees that for non-recidivists their COMPAS screen date is prior to April 1, 2014, since they need to be observed (outside jail and prison) for more than two years (or 730 days) in the data.", "(This part of the logic seems valid. Netting out jail and prison time served for the original offense that triggered the COMPAS screen seems reasonable since the probability of recidivism may be quite different while a person is serving prison time)", "For recidivists, however, the first line of the code above shows that this requirement is not in place. Presumably, ProPublica realized that it was not necessary to observe recidivists for a full two-years outside jail and prison. Given that they recidivated and could be put in prison for a non-trivial amount of time for their re-offense after their original COMPAS screen date. And one would still clearly want to include such people in the data.", "While it is logical not to implement a requirement that recidivists must be observed outside jail or prison for two years, one should still apply a COMPAS screen date sample cutoff on or before April 1, 2014, for them. But ProPublica failed to do so.", "It is not clear whether ProPublica intended to process the data this way, in which case it is a conceptual mistake, or whether it did not intend to use this faulty logic, in which case it is a data processing mistake. In either case, it leads to the same biased sample two-year sub-datasets.", "In the Figure below, based on the two-year general recidivism dataset now, I again indicate the potential two-year window COMPAS screen cutoff date with a red vertical line on April 1, 2014.", "This is the key Figure in my research paper. It shows the stark difference in the way ProPublica processed recidivists versus non-recidivists in the two-year dataset. On the right-hand-side graph, for non-recidivists, we see that ProPublica correctly dropped defendants with COMPAS screening dates after April 1, 2014.", "However, on the left-hand-side graph, for recidivists, we see that ProPublica did not drop defendants with COMPAS screening dates after April 1, 2014. Indeed, this left-side graph is almost a replica of the analogous graph in the full dataset shown earlier. The two-year dataset has essentially the same number of recidivists as the full dataset.", "ProPublica failed to implement a two-year window sample cutoff for recidivists", "To calculate the total number of extra recidivists that ProPublica incorrectly kept in the two-year dataset, I do a cross-tabulation of the two-year recidivism variable by a pre versus post-April 1, 2014 COMPAS screen date indicator flag, and count the number of defendants in each cell:", "Since ProPublica kept recidivists (but did not keep non-recidivists) with COMPAS screen dates after April 1, 2014, all the people in the two-year recidivism dataset with COMPAS screen dates after this date are indeed recidivists. The 998 recidivists incorrectly kept in ProPublica\u2019s two-year data represent a 30.7% share of the 3,251 people in total who recidivated within two years in that dataset. Alternatively, we can say that ProPublica kept 998/2253, or 44.3%, more two-year recidivists than it should have.", "This fundamental problem in the construction of the two-year recidivism dataset affects some statistics more than others. As we just saw, it has a substantial impact on the total number of recidivists, and hence, also on the share or rate of recidivism. In particular, it artificially inflates the recidivism rate. The two-year recidivism rate in ProPublica\u2019s two-year general recidivism dataset is the following:", "So the two-year recidivism rate in ProPublica\u2019s two-year dataset is 45.1%. However, if we look again at the two-year recidivism variable by a pre versus post-April 1, 2014 COMPAS screen date indicator flag, as we did in the first Table above, but now in percentage terms, we have the following Table:", "We see that if one were to apply a simple COMPAS screen date cutoff rule of April 1, 2014, for all defendants (including recidivists), the two-year recidivism rate would be 36.2%. The 45.1% rate that ProPublica calculates is almost nine percentage points higher and is thus biased upward by over 24%.", "Another way of measuring the impact of ProPublica\u2019s data processing error on the recidivism rate is by doing a survival analysis. In my paper, I do such an analysis, and it confirms the results just presented.", "In my research paper, I also explore how this data processing error impacts other statistics. Specifically, I look at ProPublica\u2019s confusion matrix (or truth table) analysis of COMPAS score vs. two-year recidivism status. For such an analysis, ProPublica turned the COMPAS score into a binary classifier, of Low vs. High scores. (In my paper I do the same)", "In addition to the prevalence of recidivism (i.e., the recidivism rate), the biased two-year dataset used by ProPublica also affects the positive predictive value (PPV) (often referred to as precision), the negative predictive value (NPV), and the detection rate. If ProPublica had correctly processed the two-year data, with the resulting lower prevalence of recidivism, not surprisingly, the PPV (and the detection rate) would be lower and the NPV higher.", "On the other hand, the biased two-year dataset has relatively little impact on several other key statistics, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative share of recidivists versus non-recidivists. In particular, the accuracy, the false positive rate (FPR), and the false negative rate (FNR). (Or one minus these rates, i.e., specificity and sensitivity)", "The FPR is by definition independent of the actual number of positives (or recidivists) in the data. It is the ratio of the number of cases predicted to be positive (or to recidivate), but that are not actually positive, over all the cases that are not positive. So the FPR is calculated based only on actual negatives (i.e., only people who do not recidivate). As a result, when one correctly processes the data, the FPR remains exactly the same as the FPR in ProPublica\u2019s two-year data.", "Similarly, the FNR is only based on actual positives or people who do recidivate. The FNR is the ratio of people predicted not to recidivate but who actually recidivate, over all people who recidivate. The total count of people who recidivate is quite different when one correctly processes the data. However, this will have little effect on the FNR as long as the COMPAS scores of the 998 additional recidivists ProPublica incorrectly kept in the two-year data are similar to the COMPAS scores of the 2,253 recidivists correctly kept such data. In my research paper, I show that this is indeed the case.", "Given the identical FPR and the very similar FNR, in my paper, I also show that there is likewise almost no impact on the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under that curve.", "In my research paper, I also repeat the confusion matrix analysis separately for African-Americans and Caucasians. This is the key analysis that garnered the most attention when ProPublica published its article in 2016, showing a higher false positive rate (FPR) and a lower false negative rate (FNR) for African-Americans than Caucasians.", "As expected, similar to the combined race results just discussed, the FPR is identical, and the FNR is very similar when processing the data correctly, so African-Americans still have a substantially higher FPR and lower FNR than Caucasians. This key finding by ProPublica, therefore, does not change when one processes the data correctly.\u00b9", "Although, just like with the combined race data results, substantial changes in other statistics for each race group do emerge when one correctly processes the two-year data. In particular, the recidivism rate, PPV, and NPV, for each race group all change considerably.", "Ultimately, the practical importance of the data processing error I identify here may be limited. I am not suggesting, for example, that Northpointe made a mistake when developing the COMPAS recidivism risk score itself (although the data used for that, and the actual model, are proprietary and not publicly available).", "Domain expertise, however, does not always translate into correctly processed data. For example, Northpointe\u2019s critique of ProPublica\u2019s analysis using the same ProPublica COMPAS datasets fails to identify ProPublica\u2019s data processing error.", "Other researchers who have worked with these data also fail to identify the processing error in ProPublica\u2019s two-year dataset. As a result, as I detail in my research paper, they produce Figures with two-year recidivism rates that are biased upward.", "Despite this, the thrust of their analyses remains valid. Most of the fair machine learning research appears to target the FPR, the FNR, or the accuracy, which, as discussed above, are not impacted by the data processing error.", "Finally, many potential measurement issues may affect the estimated two-year recidivism rate in ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS data (as I mention in my paper). Some of these could be putting downward pressure on the estimate, perhaps offsetting to some degree the upward bias I identify here.", "This last point, however, does not invalidate the emphasis on the data processing issue I identify and the ensuing data correction I call for. My focus is on the internal validity of the data processing. I am not claiming that after this correction, the data will not have any remaining issues, nor necessarily that it will have external validity, which is beyond the scope of my analysis.", "In any case, nobody appears to have previously visualized the COMPAS screening dates for the two-year recidivism dataset, as I do above. (If they have, it has not been widely disseminated) Thus, the data processing error I identify here has persisted and propagated for more than three years (with the notable exception of Rudin et al. 2018).\u00b2", "My post and paper attempt to put the focus back on, and highlight the potential pitfalls in, the data processing stage.", "For an even shorter summary of my paper, see my short version of this blog post.
