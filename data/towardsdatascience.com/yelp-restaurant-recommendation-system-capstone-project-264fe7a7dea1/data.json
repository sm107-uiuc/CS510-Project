The nature of a coding bootcamp meant that it was an intense experience with a steep learning curve, covering machine learning topics like Feature Engineering, Decision Trees, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning Neural Networks, all in just 12 weeks! Nevertheless, the experience was an enriching one as it gave me the opportunity to code in Python day in and day out, completing coding assignments as well as working on personal data science projects for my portfolio. With the skills developed during this bootcamp, I am now truly confident in entering the world of data science as a full-time career.", "Looking back on these past few months, this bootcamp has given me a strong understanding of the end-to-end data science process as well as familiarity with the programming languages and tools needed for data analysis and data modeling. Towards the end of the bootcamp, each student had the opportunity to work on a personal capstone project to showcase all the data science concepts and techniques that we have learned throughout the 12 weeks. In this post, I will be explaining my capstone project and the end-to-end process that I undertook to build my data science models.", "For my capstone project, I wanted to build something that would be meaningful for people in their everyday lives. This ultimately led me to build a recommendation system model that could recommend people restaurants near their location based on restaurant reviews from other people, drawing on sentiment analysis that could potentially improve the recommendation suggestions that you see on common food delivery apps like Deliveroo, GrabFood, and FoodPanda.", "For the purpose of this data science project, the dataset that I built my models on was taken from the Yelp Dataset, which has been made publicly available for personal, educational, and academic purposes. Due to the sheer size of this dataset, I decided to concentrate my efforts on restaurant reviews data in the city of Toronto as it had the most number of reviews as compared to the other 9 cities in this dataset. This left me with data from a total of 5,471 Restaurants, 44,485 Users, and 253,050 Restaurant Reviews in Toronto from 2015\u20132019.", "Using the Plotly Package in Python, I was able to create a geographical visualization of restaurants in the city of Toronto. Most restaurant businesses were concentrated in downtown Toronto, which is the main central business district.", "Among the various restaurant categories, the top 5 categories were: Nightlife, Bars, Coffee & Tea, Fast Food, and Breakfast & Brunch.", "For each restaurant review, each user left a rating on a scale of 1\u20135 that indicated their overall experience visiting a restaurant. The distribution of review ratings was skewed to the left with more users giving higher ratings than lower ratings on average.", "Leveraging on the text reviews left by each Yelp User, I was able to create new rating scores for each User by incorporating sentiment analysis of their text reviews. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the attitude or emotion of the user (whether it is positive or negative or neutral).", "Textblob\u2019s Polarity Score was able to give me a score that indicated how positive or negative a statement was in a range from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). Additionally, I also used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner), which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. VADER\u2019s compound score also indicates how positive or negative a statement was in a range from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive).", "By incorporating these quantitative sentiment scores, I was able to create a super-score for each user in the range of [0, 6] that better reflected their overall experience visiting a restaurant and used this score as a basis for my recommendation models.", "To further make sense of the text in my reviews data, I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an example of topic modeling, to classify text in a document to a particular topic. LDA builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.", "After performing LDA, I was able to create a few dominant topics that yielded interesting insights into the types of topics that people were talking about in their Yelp Reviews. Specifically, topics 3, 4, and 5 from my LDA plot created topics that associated reviews to specific food cuisines (Western, Dessert, Asian). Allocating different reviews to different dominant topics would allow me to build a content-based recommendation model that recommended restaurants to users based on similar preferences.", "To solve the initial user cold-start problem, I decided to use a naive solution that gives new users restaurant recommendations through location proximity data. Knowing a person\u2019s geographical location at the point of time where he is deciding to find new restaurants to visit, we can use a Location-Based Recommendation System to recommend restaurants near his/her vicinity. By providing an initial recommendation that is convenient for the user, we can attract him/her to start using our app and thereafter build on his/her initial preference to recommend other restaurants.", "One way where we can group restaurants together based on geographical location is by using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. The K-Means algorithm predicts the cluster where the user is located in and pulls out this cluster\u2019s top 10 restaurants and recommends them to him.", "For example, we have a new user, who has just visited the Royal Ontario Museum. He wants to have a meal but is unsure of what nice restaurants are around his location. By inputting his longitude and latitude coordinates into our model, we can recommend him 10 highly rated restaurants near his location and get him interested in using our recommendation app as a user.", "Once we get new users to start using our app, we can improve upon our model recommendations by taking these 4 steps: take feedback, retrain models, sort the predicted ratings, return the highest projected recommendation.", "For my collaborative-filtering recommendation model, it works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the restaurants they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggested restaurants. The 3 main steps I took to create my item-item matrix include:", "2. Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)", "When it comes to matrix factorization techniques, truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a popular method to produce features that factors a matrix M into the three matrices U, \u03a3, and V. Unlike regular SVDs, truncated SVD produces a factorization where the number of columns can be specified for a number of truncations. For example, given a (n x n) matrix, truncated SVD generates the matrices with the specified number of columns, whereas SVD outputs n columns of matrices. Truncated SVD can deal with sparse matrix to generate features\u2019 matrices, whereas Principal Component Analysis would operate on the entire matrix for the output of the covariance matrix.", "3. Create an Item-Item based matrix based on Cosine Similarity", "For this recommendation model, all that users have to input is a restaurant name that they have previously enjoyed visiting into the model and it will generate a list of the 10 most recommended restaurants based on the highest cosine similarity scores to that particular restaurant.", "For my content-based recommendation model, it works by recommending restaurants to users based on similar restaurant categories and dominant topic keywords, thus suggesting restaurants that align with a user\u2019s preferences. The 3 main steps I took to create my item-item matrix include:", "CountVectorizer converts a collection of text documents into a vector of token counts. Furthermore, it enables the pre-processing of text data before generating the vector representation.", "3. Create a Cosine Similarity Matrix", "Likewise, for this recommendation model, all that users have to input is a restaurant name that they have previously enjoyed visiting into the model and it will generate a list of the 10 most recommended restaurants based on similar categorical and dominant topic keywords.", "During the Circuit Breaker Period earlier this year, many lesser-known restaurants have struggled during these times due to the lack of customers and orders.", "With Singapore moving slowly towards Phase 3 by the end of 2020, more people will be going out in groups of 5\u20138 to frequent restaurants all over town.", "As such, my recommendation models could provide them with an alternative food recommendation system that suggests lesser-known local restaurants that are highly rated by other customers.", "To help such restaurants, what I will need in the future is local restaurant businesses and reviews data to train my recommendation models.", "Nevertheless, there are also several limitations to my models. With more time in the future, there are other aspects that I can explore to improve my models. These include:", "If you\u2019ve come this far, I would like to sincerely thank you for taking the time to read my Medium Post. As I venture into the world of business and technology, I hope to explore more trendings topics in data science that can be used to improve people\u2019s lives on a daily basis.", "If you would like to hear more about my future posts, kindly follow me on Medium as I continue in my data science journey!", "Your home for data science.
