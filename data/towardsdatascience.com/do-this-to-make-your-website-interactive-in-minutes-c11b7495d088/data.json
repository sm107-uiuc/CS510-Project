This post will guide you through the tool, including setup and creating several types of figures on a page.", "Chart.js is a free, open-source library used to animate graphs within JavaScript files and HTML canvas elements. It includes eight different types of graphs: line, bar, donut, pie, scatter, bubble, radar, and polar area, but it\u2019s also possible to mix-and-match multiple figures on the same page.", "We\u2019ll go through how to set up Chart.js, create initial graphs regarding world demographics, and style them.", "Here are links to all the data sources used in this tutorial.", "I\u2019ve put together a GitHub repository of everything we\u2019ll cover in this tutorial. If you open the index.html file, you should see a page of graphs and tables pop up in your browser.", "Now, open up index.html in a text editor for code. To easily import the latest version of Chart.js, we\u2019ll use use this CDN link (ending in \u201cChart.min.js\u201d). Then, place the link in a script tag as shown above.", "To format our charts, include CDN links to Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap JS. If you think more information on Bootstrap would be helpful, check it out here.", "One main thing we need to prepare before we can start visualizing our data is to define an area in our HTML where we want to draw the graph. We must add canvas elements for each graph we want on our webpage. Here\u2019s how this works.", "In our code snippet above, we give our graph (in this case, a line graph) an id , which is line, to the canvas element that we can later use to reference our designated graph element in JavaScript. You can name this element anything you want; the only thing that matters is that you use the same id when referring to the graph within all your files. Keep in mind that every id must be unique.", "To keep my data easily organized, I choose to place each graph\u2019s code in a separate JavaScript file. Feel free to follow a different format, but it is what I find works best.", "Create a JavaScript file (and place it into a new folder called .js if you prefer).", "Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s happening in line.js. First, we locate the canvas element added earlier to our index.html file (notice the id line. Then, using that canvas element, we create a line chart (type: 'line'), and pass in our data.", "Compile all the data you need for the graphs. For this sample line graph, we\u2019ll use The World Bank\u2019s population growth statistics. Download the data (or enter it in manually if you wish).", "Then, copy-and-paste the data into an array format as shown below. This is an integral part of the overall structure of the JavaScript files.", "We can give the dataset a label as well. If you save and refresh the HTML page, you\u2019ll see a new line graph. However, we can take steps to customize the visuals, including axis tick marks and labels, chart titles, point and line colors, hover effects, and much more!", "We can also add multiple datasets to one graph, which helps depict more trends. This is currently commented out in the code below.", "For every line that we want to create, we add another object to the datasets array. Each object can have a range of adjustments; we can not only pass new data to draw the line, but we can change the name, behavior, and looks of the line. These features can be edited as depicted in the finished line.js file. Read more detailed descriptions about all the customizations you can choose from in the Chart.js documentation!", "So far, we\u2019ve walked through how to create, personalize, and view a line graph on a webpage. Let\u2019s look at some other visualizations offered by Chart.js. These are all included in the repository linked at the beginning of this tutorial.", "Chart.js offers several other types of charts such as tables, bar charts, pie charts, scatter charts, and more.
