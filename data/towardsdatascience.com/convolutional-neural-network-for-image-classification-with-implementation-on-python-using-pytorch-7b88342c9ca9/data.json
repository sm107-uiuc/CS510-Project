It provides a simple implementation of the CNN algorithm using the framework PyTorch on Python.There are many free courses that can be found on the internet. Personally, I suggest the course of Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) at Stanford. You will learn a lot, it is a step by step course. In addition, it provides many practical strategies to implement the CNN architecture.", "Before going deep into Convolutional Neural Network, it is worth understanding their concept. CNN falls in the category of the supervised algorithms. The algorithm learns from training data, e,g, a set of images in the input and their associated labels at the output.", "It consists of feeding the convolutional neural network with images of the training set, x, and their associated labels (targets), y, in order to learn network\u2019s function, y=f(x). After learning the parameter of the network\u2019s function (namely weight and bias), we test the network with unseen images in order to predict their labels. The architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet)", "The CNN architecture we used in this article is proposed in this paper.", "The network is implemented as a class called CNN. It contains two main methods. The first method (__init__) defines layers components of the network. In the second method (forward) we wire the network and put every component in the desired order (as shown in the picture).", "The python code below is straightforward. The network is defined using the neural network module of Torch. Notice that we already choose hyper-parameters of the network, such as Padding (P), Stride (S) and Kernel_size (F). Also the number of filters at each layer,\u2026.", "The input image has four dimensions, (batch_size, num_channel, height, width). The algorithm outputs an array with ten\u00a0values, corresponding to the score (or amount of energy) of the predicted labels of the image. Therefore, the maximum score is the predicted label (or class) to retain for the\u00a0tested\u00a0image.", "In the following bullet we will explain the role of each layer of the algorithm:", "Furthermore, the Conv layer is applied repeatedly to extract fine features that characterize the input image. The outputs of the Conv layer are called features map (or activation map), where each spatial position (or pixel) represents an artificial neuron.", "For this article, I used the neural network framework PyTorch to implement the CNN architecture detailed above.", "The full code is available in my GitHub repository:", "The code is quite simple to understand, hopefully, since it mentions all the layers we discussed earlier in an intuitive way.", "Note that all the number mentioned in the input of the methods is parameters. They define the CNN architecture: kernel_size, stride, padding, input/output of each Conv layer. The code below defines a class called CNN where we define the CNN architecture in order.", "The output of the above code summarizes the network architecture:", "In order to acquire the MNIST images, we use a method of torchvision library. Just copy-paste this code to download the data. Basically, two datasets are loaded. The training dataset serves as ground truth to compute the network parameters. The testing images", "This is an essential stage of a supervised algorithm. By feeding the algorithm with many examples of image and their associated labels, we teach the algorithm to find patterns of each class. This is done by computing the filter\u2019s parameters (weight and bias).", "The training of the network is composed of two major steps, forward and backward:", "We also need to define a loss function, e.g. Cross-entropy loss function, and an optimization algorithm, such as Gradient descent, SGD, Adam (Adaptive moment estimation)\u2026", "\u2014 Initialize the parameters (weights: w, bias: b) \u2014 Optimize the loss iteratively to learn parameters (w,b) \u2014 Compute the loss function and its gradients \u2014 Update parameters using an optimization algorithm (e,g, Adam) \u2014 Use the learned parameters to predict the label for a given input image", "Python implementation of training CNN in Python using PyTorch", "Plotting these plots help monitor understanding the convergence of the algorithm. The loss plot is decreasing during the training which a what we want since the goal of the optimization algorithm (Adam) is to minimize the loss function. On the right, the plot shows the evolution of the classification accuracy during the training. The more we train the algorithm, the better the classification accuracy. Notice the fluctuation of the accuracy between ~90 and 100 %. Better tuning of hyper-parameters will provide a precise classification.", "The algorithm now is able to understand the content of these images thanks to the training of CNN.", "This article attempts to explain briefly the convolutional neural network without going deep into mathematical development. An illustration is provided at each step with a visual explanation, as well as an application of image classification of MNIST dataset. Finally, a python implementation using PyTorch library is presented in order to provide a concrete example of application.
