And compared to data science, we see far fewer academic and \u201cmathy\u201d backgrounds.", "More than 50% of previous roles fell into software engineering (SDE), data science (DS) and business intelligence (BI).", "So if you\u2019re interested in data engineering, it may make sense to become a software developer or data scientist first.", "What is the average salary of data engineers?", "According to Payscale, the average data engineering role ($92k) pays more than software engineering ($86k) and data science ($87k) roles.", "We know averages are misleading, but a $6k difference is significant.", "I suspect this is partly attributable to data engineer roles being on average more senior than SDE and DS roles. Senior candidates and a small talent pool could drive up the price.", "That said, you probably shouldn\u2019t move into data engineering (or any role?) just for the money.", "What is the highest education level achieved before obtaining a data engineering role?", "Among 50 resumes, 90% had master degrees, 10% had bachelor degrees, and none had PhDs.", "The role is arguably less \u201cacademic\u201d than data science. So the lack of PhDs doesn\u2019t surprise me, but the high proportion of master degrees does.", "This could be due to a bad sample, but I suspect there is some rationale behind it.", "If anyone has incite, I\u2019d love to hear it!", "What major was studied during the highest level of education?", "All majors are STEM, and most are CS related.", "Compared to data science, there are far fewer economics, business, and math majors.", "I suspect that previous role is a stronger indicator of suitability than education, but the distribution is still interesting.", "Do data engineers hold data engineering related certifications?", "Almost 60% do. The real number is probably higher as this only accounts for certifications listed on resumes.", "I\u2019ve long recommended against collecting certifications in order to qualify for jobs. There are better approaches.", "But I consider data engineering and devops as exceptions to this rule.", "Algorithm challenges in a software engineering interview give some signal regarding coding ability. But ability in provisioning cloud services is more difficult to test.", "For this reason, certification program offered by the large cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure\u2026) may actually be a good path to communicating competency.", "How many years experience do data engineers have between completing their undergraduate degree, and obtaining a data engineering role?", "Almost no data engineers move directly into the role upon graduation.", "This supports my hypothesis that data engineering is not an entry level job, and requires competencies best developed in other roles.", "In contrast, I\u2019d guess the same chart for SDE and DS would show data shifted to the left.", "If any data engineers have corrections or insights, I\u2019d love to hear them!", "If you want to accomplish something yourself, start by looking at how others accomplished the same task. That is what I tried to do here.", "While the number of data points is small, it provides some idea of the type of individuals working in data engineering.", "If you enjoyed this, you may be interested in my analysis of data science profiles.", "Your home for data science.
