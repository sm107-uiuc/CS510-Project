From numerous presentations I made for various audiences, I learned that despite the usual uncertainty visualization techniques such as box plots, violin plots, confidence bands, etc., are compact and precise in displaying uncertainty, they may only resonate among trained statisticians.", "For broader audiences, including stakeholders, domain experts, etc., who don\u2019t necessarily have a strong background in statistics, they often found those plots complicated and confusing, rendering them bad choices for getting the idea across.", "Over the past few years, by trial-and-error, I\u2019ve learned the trick to address this communication issue: instead of using static visualizations of uncertainty, I could make uncertainty presentation more vivid by using animations. More specifically, I create animations to cycle through a number of different plots, each of which simulates one possible scenario drawn from the outcome distribution.", "It\u2019s a simple idea, yet a powerful one. My audiences can now \u201cexperience\u201d first-hand the uncertainty, which would otherwise be hard and abstract to interpret.", "This animation way of presenting uncertainty has a formal name: hypothetical outcome plots, which was first proposed by Jessica Hullman and co-workers at Midwest Uncertainty (MU) Collective.", "In this article, I\u2019d like to share with you three examples to showcase this visualization approach. Those case studies are derived (simplified) from my previous projects:", "\u00b7 1. Regression Analysiswhere hypothetical outcome plots help the audience to see alternative trend curves supported by the noisy training data;", "\u00b7 2. Projectile Motion Problemwhere hypothetical outcome plots help the audience to sense the variation in shooting range induced by uncertain shooting conditions;", "\u00b7 3. Battery Prognostic Analysiswhere hypothetical outcome plots help the audience to understand the battery failure risks with different cycle numbers.", "If you want to know how those animations are created in Python, please check out the companion Jupyter Notebooks I\u2019ve created.", "In this case study, our goal is to construct a statistical model to approximate a function f(x) given the noisy training data (shown below). Specifically, we use a supervised machine learning technique called Gaussian Process (GP) to train the desired statistical model.", "Naturally, fitting a curve to the noisy data has uncertainty, which is commonly shown in the form of a confident band. In the figure below, a credibility interval derived from the GP model's posterior distribution is shown to visualize the uncertainty.", "Although the confidence band is a popular way in academia, for a broad audience, this static uncertainty visualization can be misleading in at least two ways:", "To address those two issues, we could use hypothetical outcome plots instead. Simply put, we can create an animation to cycle through a number of random draws of possible GP regression curves.", "The above animation allows the audiences to experience the GP prediction uncertainty first-hand. Instead of showing the confusing credibility band, hypothetical outcome plots illustrate vividly the alternative regression curves supported by the given training data.", "In this case study, our goal is to visualize the uncertainty of the shooting range of a projectile.", "To give it some context, the following sketch illustrates the physics of the problem, where the shooting range R is determined by v\u2080, the initial velocity, \u03b8, the shooting angle, and g=9.8m/s\u00b2, the gravity acceleration. The considered physical model is a simple one. But it is good enough for our demonstration purpose.", "In reality, we may not be sure about the values of v\u2080 and \u03b8. As a result, the output R is also uncertain. To properly quantify the uncertainty of the shooting range R, we need to perform an uncertainty propagation analysis, which involves specifying probability distributions to the uncertain inputs (v\u2080 and \u03b8) and conducting Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability distribution of the output (R). For more details, feel free to check my previous post:", "Commonly, the results of the above uncertainty analysis are visualized via a histogram, as shown below. It tells you everything about how likely the shooting range value may fall within a specific range. It\u2019s all good, except it\u2019s super dull. Can we at least make the visualization cool enough to match with the fancy uncertainty analysis?", "Sure we can. How? By using hypothetical outcome plots:", "Using animations help us to clearly see the possible projectile motion trajectories induced by uncertain v\u2080 and \u03b8. This is a much more intuitive, effective, and fun way to show the uncertainty analysis results.", "In this case study, we focus on visualizing the uncertainty of the degradation evolution of a battery. In particular, we will see how hypothetical outcome plots can highlight the risk of battery failure after a certain usage time.", "This case study has its root in predictive maintenance, where a primary goal is to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of a product in service. In this case, we look at a battery, whose capacity degrades as it going through many charging-discharging cycles.", "A popular way to deliver this prognostic analysis is by combining physical models with historically measured degradation data: the measured data is firstly used to calibrate (via Bayesian statistics) the unknown parameters of the physical model. Later on, the calibrated parameters are plugged into the model to predict the degradation evolution and estimate when battery failure happens, i.e., its capacity drops below a given threshold.", "In general, the degradation prediction will be uncertain once we consider the posterior distribution of the physical model parameter. As a result, it is of particular interest to calculate the battery failure risk after a certain number of cycles.", "Hypothetical outcome plots can easily make the abstract concept of risk much more concrete. Here is an animation that shows possible degradation paths a battery may experience after 100 cycles. Each degradation path is calculated based on a specific parameter sample drawn from the parameter posterior distribution.", "As demonstrated in the animation, out of all the simulated paths, only a few of them that drop below the failure threshold after 100 cycles. Therefore, we can conclude that the associated failure risk is rather low.", "Here is another animation with possible degradation paths after 110 cycles.", "It is obvious that the failure risk is much higher now since there are more simulated paths that drop below the failure threshold after 110 cycles. By using simulated hypothetical outcome plots, the failure risk can be clearly highlighted and audiences can conveniently compare the risk magnitude between different cases.", "One thing to keep in mind when creating your own hypothetical outcome plots: we need to make sure that the simulations we show represent the true outcome distribution. This issue is less obvious when we can animate a large number of samples, but more prominent when the animated sample number is small, which is often constrained by the animation time length. You don\u2019t want to run into the risk of sampling bias.", "For the Python code that generates those animations, please check out the companion Jupyter Notebooks I\u2019ve created.", "[1] UW Interactive Data Lab, Hypothetical Outcome Plots: Experiencing the Uncertain, Medium, 2016.[2] Claus Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization, O\u2019Reilly, 2019.", "I\u2019m a Ph.D. researcher working on uncertainty quantification and reliability analysis for aerospace applications.
