This is not an article asking \u201cwhere is your data science team?\u201d to convince you that it is useful to have one (for that you can read this). This is an article questioning \u201cwhere exactly did you place your data science team?\u201d within your organisation and whether that makes sense or not.", "Let\u2019s examine the concept of the organisational structure before we get to where a data science team fits. Despite the proliferation of flat and minimal structure, we all know that in practice we are working in some sort of structure once the company gets to a certain size whether it has been explicitly stated by management or not. Organisational structure matters because it provides guidance to everyone by laying out reporting lines, mapping out communication flows and it enables people to organise themselves. It is worth highlighting that while organisation structure is somewhat correlated to the hierarchy, the two are not necessarily the same. I have come to learn that when people say that they enjoy a flat structure, they usually mean that they enjoy an environment that is less hierarchical in decision making. After all, it is very difficult to self coordinate a large number of people towards a single company goal without some sort of structure in place to facilitate that.", "The organisational structure is key in determining whether a company can effectively achieve its goals. It is a significant part of its operations because it constrains what people can do within their role, teams and reporting lines. Most likely we would have heard things along the line of \u201cthat\u2019s not our team\u2019s responsibilities\u201d or \u201cwe can\u2019t do this because the other team is looking after it\u201d, sometimes those make sense in making sure teams stay focused, but sometimes it is that arbitrary structure that prevents us from doing the right thing. Even with a team of superstars, you need the overall structure to enable them to collaborate and deliver excellent results.", "There are many different schools of thought when it comes to organisational structure, each with their own pros and cons. The key here is to understand what benefits you are getting and what problems you need to mitigate when it comes to setting up the right structure for your data science team. At a high level, traditionally we classify organisational structure on a spectrum with functional on one end and divisional on another. A functional structure means teams are defined by their specialities, e.g. when we have a finance team, a marketing team and an engineering team. A divisional structure means teams are grouped to align on their markets and products, e.g. teams based on geography, or teams based on a particular product class and these teams involve people from different specialities. Usually, a functional structure encourages efficiency as it centralises expertise while divisional structure can react quickly to the market as they are closer to the customers and have all the people required to react without cross-divisional support. However, as Intel management legend Andy Grove suggested in his book High Output Management, organisations that reached sufficient size will converge into a matrix structure where teams are structured divisionally with a functional oversight. Despite the overhead it might cause to have duo reporting lines, it is the only practical structure that encourages agility with divisional teams while maintaining a level of efficiency with the overarching functional teams. And recently we have seen the rise of cross-functional team structure due to the adoption of agile delivery methodologies where teams are fully self-sufficient and work off their own backlog following the agile framework. These are few of the many structures that are common in practice and they all present different advantages and challenges.", "For organisations with an existing functional structure, the most logical way to place a data science team is by creating a centralised team. It can be a standalone team or placed under a larger team like technology or product, but essentially the team will consist of only data roles. This team will then act as the internal function that supports different teams with their data needs.", "There are several key benefits with this approach,", "However there are also some challenges with this structure,", "On the other end of the spectrum, companies that are using the embedded model will have each of their business unit hiring their own data roles. This encourages autonomy and specialisation as each divisional team can hire for their specific requirements. Usually, the data roles in this setting will have a narrower focus because the scope within a single team is smaller compared to a data team servicing all different part of the business.", "There are some advantages for this model,", "But this also creates the following challenges,", "Of course, the two examples above are more archetypal than practical because most organisations are somewhere in between these two well-defined models. This is where the matrix organisation fits in by providing a functional structure to overlay the divisional teams. This model establishes the communication channel that bridges the gap from a pure divisional structure. The functional overlay is where knowledge can be shared and standards can be applied. It also creates a mechanism where large cross-divisional projects can be executed. While this is ideal in theory, this extra layer can be quite complicated to manage with dual reporting lines and competing interests between the two structures. Much like solutions that combine different ideas, this can easily combine the problems from the two previous models rather than bringing the best of both worlds together. To make matrix organisation work for a data science team, one will need a strong data science leadership team to drive functional excellence and divisional leaders who understand the long term value of having their data science teams participate in those functional activities. They will need to work together to ensure their overall visions are aligned to minimise tension between the two reporting lines.", "There is also a new structure that is quickly gaining popularity, especially in the tech industry, that focuses on a small cross-functional team that is fully self-sufficient. This is a similar concept to the divisional structure but taken further and with even more focus on agility and independence. The key difference here is the empowerment of small teams to make their own decisions which shorten the usual cycle of business proposal and approval processes in hopes to gain speed advantage that enables the team to react to market demand as quickly as they can without unnecessary oversight. This is perhaps the overcorrection from the large corporate structures with layers of hierarchy to now creating small teams with as much autonomy as possible. There are also variants like holocracy and other models that are trying to achieve the same goal by pushing as much power to the people who are executing on the ground as possible. This is an interesting shift because it encourages problems to be broken down into smaller pieces and it focuses on iterative testing and improvement. So on one hand, it fits perfectly with data science where it is all about learning and experimentation. But on the other, it creates the same challenge that large scale problem can\u2019t be tackled under this framework easily and people end up trying to fit a big round peg (foundational problem) into in a tiny square hole (divisional solutions). One of the ways that companies are trying to resolve this is to eliminate the large scale problem altogether by enabling different teams to completely own their part of the shared problem and standardising the communication channels between teams instead. With this approach, we see teams owning their own infrastructure independent of other teams as long as they can provide a consistent way for other teams to collaborate with them. This could be implemented in the form of a common set of predefined application programming interfaces (APIs) or publishing a data catalogue for other teams to leverage. This aligns closely to the concept of DevOps where the mantra is \u201cyou build it, you run it\u201d and the concept of microservice architecture which is to break down the monolithic problems into tiny problems that can be solved independently. Technology companies have an edge when it comes to this as those are software development concepts and more traditional companies will likely struggle with this model in practice.", "There is no best way to place a data science team and each structure will inevitably have its advantages and disadvantages. A lot of the time, solutions fail not because the team was incompetent, or the data was incorrect or the methodology was wrong, they fail because the environment didn\u2019t even give the team a chance to succeed. We often take the structure we are working in for granted because it seems too difficult to change, but it is paramount that we get the structure right. We need to recognise the complex and unique nature of a data science team and make adjustments to the existing structure to ensure the environment is working for the team rather than against them. It does not matter which structure one ends up going with as long as the challenges associated with are is well understood and mitigated. For those who are in a position to change the environment, it is your responsibility to set up the right structure for the team and lead them to success.
