It not only gave me tremendous exposure to some cutting edge technology but also brought a smile to the faces of those around me. In these trying times, I think we could all use a smile.", "We are using a style of comedy called \u201cshock humor\u201d here. When somebody hears their name coupled with a compliment coming from an inanimate object when they least expect it, it is sure to leave them in tears of laughter for minutes to come.", "No programming ability is expected of you in this tutorial (although it certainly helps). Just the ability to follow directions is truly all you need.", "Make your girlfriend, boyfriend, son, daughter, husband, wife, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, dog laugh today!", "Create an Alexa skill to spread positivity.", "You will need the following items to get started on this tutorial:", "Log into your AWS account and navigate to AWS Lambda which you will find under the Compute section:", "Then we will click on the Create Function button inside of the AWS Lambda dashboard:", "For this Lambda function, we are going to use a Serverless App Repository created by somebody else. These repositories are created by AWS, AWS partners and other developers and are made readily available for us.", "If you are not seeing any Alexa skill-related options, try switching your region to us-east-1.

Feel free to edit anything else:", "You\u2019ll notice that I took everything out of the FACTS array. This is because this specific Alexa skill is designed to select an element randomly from the array to say. When there is only one element in the array, there is only one option for it to say :)", "Put whatever you want into these fields.

It\u2019s that easy.", "Now, this step is essential. We must change our endpoint to be the endpoint from our AWS Lambda function. Otherwise, how will it know which Lambda function to trigger?", "Go back to your Lambda function in AWS and look for the ARN at the top right-hand corner:", "Copy that to your clipboard, and paste it in the Default Region field of the Endpoint tab:", "Click the Save Endpoints button at the top.", "Now we need to add a new Intent. This is what you need to say to your Alexa for it to trigger your Lambda function. So you\u2019ll see below that I\u2019ve entered, \u201cwhat do I think of tara.\u201d Tara is the name of my girlfriend; you can make this anything.", "This utterance is what you will need to say to your Alexa device for it to respond with what you wrote in the AWS Lambda function code.", "Once you\u2019ve added all of the utterances you want your Alexa to respond to, click Save Model and Build Model.
