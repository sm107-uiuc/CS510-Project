From humble beginnings, it developed significant cultural capital. It now boasts nearly quarter of a million daily readers, and had no small hand in the early success of many bands that became household names (Arcade Fire\u2019s debut LP, \u2018Funeral\u2019, briefly went out of print following the Pitchfork\u2019s glowing review).", "However, as The Onion\u2019s spoof suggests, such unreserved praise is considered uncharacteristic. What the self-declared \u2018Most Trusted Voice In Music\u2019 giveth with one hand, it can certainly taketh with the other (many of my own favourite bands have taken a savaging over the years).", "Pitchfork is often accused of being deliberately provocative and contrarian with its reviews in order to attract attention. Accusations of pretension (motivated by the site\u2019s often verbose, tangential style) are further driven by Pitchfork\u2019s decimal rating system, which means that it scores albums on a 0\u2013100 scale, as opposed to the simple 5 star grading deployed by most traditional critics. It can often feel like this is the case solely to put down your favourite albums to an even greater level of precision.", "Of course, to find out whether or not any of these accusations are justified, it makes sense to look at the data.", "The datasets we will use for this analysis were generated by scraping the review-aggregation website, Metacritic (this process was covered in a previous blog).", "Having done this, we have the following information about some 202,000 album reviews:", "The \u2018Metascore\u2019 is a weighted average of an album\u2019s different critic reviews. Though the exact methodology that Metacritic uses to create the Metascore is not konwn, Metacritic suggests that extra weight is given \u201cbased on [a publication\u2019s] quality and overall stature\u201d. It then normalises these scores (akin to \u201cgrading on a curve\u201d in college) to prevent scores from clumping together. At any rate, the Metascore is the best measure we have for the \u2018true\u2019 quality of any given album.", "Pitchfork has been one of the most prolific music publications of the last twenty years. Only two others have more reviews in the dataset, and since 2018, Pitchfork has published more reviews on a monthly basis than anyone else, aside from AllMusic.", "There is a very crude way to measure a publication\u2019s harshness \u2014 take an average of each publication\u2019s review scores, and rank them. Doing this, we see that there are many harsher critics than Pitchfork, which just scrapes into the top (or bottom?) thirty publications.", "Of course, this analysis is flawed. We\u2019ve already seen that the publications have reviewed different numbers of albums \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the case that Pitchfork has simply reviewed more good albums, given the breadth of its catalogue. We thus need to introduce a more robust measure of harshness.", "We\u2019ve already suggested that the Metascore is probably the best measure we have of an album\u2019s true quality. Thus, we can identify a harsh review by comparing the Metascore with the individual review score.", "Let\u2019s isolate Pitchfork\u2019s reviews. We can plot each review\u2019s Pitchfork score against the corresponding Metascore. Albums that Pitchfork have reviewed \u2018harshly\u2019 therefore fall below the purple \u2018x=y\u2019 line. We can see a lot of points fall below that line \u2014 more than two thirds, in fact.", "We can boil this \u2018harshness\u2019 concept down into a single KPI \u2014 a review\u2019s \u2018Difference to Metascore\u2019. This is easily calculated as the difference between the two numbers. In the chart above, it would be given as the vertical distance between the point and the purple line.", "So for Pitchfork\u2019s review of the latest Foals album, the Difference to Metascore would be 60 minus 78, i.e. -18 (seemingly quite harsh!)", "Therefore, the more negative \u2018Difference to Metascores\u2019 a publication has, the more harsh we can judge it to be. If we plot a histogram of Pitchfork\u2019s score differences, we see that the majority of them are negative (which we knew from the above scatter plot).", "On average, Pitchfork scores almost a whole half-star lower than we would expect, given the Metascores of the albums that it has reviewed.", "If you\u2019re wondering which albums are to be found in that long tail on the left, then we can only hope that you\u2019re not a fan of Northern State\u2026", "One of the advantages of the \u2018Difference to Metacritic\u2019 KPI is that we can compare fairly across publications.", "If we plot the mean score difference to Metascore for each publication, we actually see that Pitchfork doesn\u2019t look especially remarkable \u2014 especially relative to other publications with a similar number of published reviews.", "Many of the publications at the extremities of harshness and generosity (i.e. on the far left and far right of the above scatter) are much smaller concerns. The three harshest (Drawer B, Select, and Vulture) only published 318 reviews between them. The most generous are often \u2018record of the week\u2019 style columns, from which we would expect high scores.", "If we isolate the top thirty publications (each with over 2,000 reviews in the dataset) we see that only a sixth of them review more generously than Metascores suggest they ought to \u2014 the only especially generous critic amongst them is Entertainment Weekly (make of that what you will). At any rate, by this measure, Pitchfork\u2019s review scores don\u2019t look particularly notable.", "However, something interesting emerges if we go beyond the average score differences for each publication, and instead look at distribution of these differences. A histogram works if we\u2019re doing this for one publication (as we did for Pitchfork a few paragraphs ago), however to compare multiple distributions side by side, we can use Seaborn\u2019s violinplot function. Below, we plot the distributions for the ten most prolific publications in the dataset.", "If we compare the score difference distributions for the these publications, there is something that stands out for Pitchfork \u2014 the distribution\u2019s kurtosis.", "Kurtosis is a measure of a distribution\u2019s \u2018tailedness\u2019, and tells us how extreme its outliers are. The formula for kurtosis is constructed such that any datapoint within one standard deviation of the distribution\u2019s mean contributes very little. Thus, a distribution that simultaneously has a low standard deviation and long tails is likely to have a high kurtosis.", "Indeed, looking at Pitchfork\u2019s \u2018violin\u2019 in the above plot, we see that it\u2019s bunched quite tightly around the mean (resulting in a wide violin with steep slopes either side of the peak). It also has a very long negative tail.", "Only Under The Radar has a more negative score difference within its distribution (they awarded a big fat zero to \u2018Burned Mind\u2019 by Wolf Eyes, to which, ever-obtuse, Pitchfork gave a highly commendable 8.0), however their score differences are much more loosely bunched.", "If we plot all the publications on a scatter, we see that Pitchfork has one of the highest kurtosis scores of all critic in the dataset \u2014 certainly the highest of any big title.", "Based on what we have seen, it doesn\u2019t seem so. Of the main publications in the dataset, this award probably goes to Under The Radar, who, across nearly 5,000 reviews, under-scores by almost 7 percentage points on average.", "What we can say about Pitchfork, however, is that it\u2019s actually quite consistent. It tends to under-score albums, but not by an egregious amount relative to other publications of a similar size. In fact, of the top thirty publications, Pitchfork has the highest share of review scores within \u2018half a star\u2019 of the Metascore. In other words, it seems to be pretty good at judging an album\u2019s \u2018true quality\u2019.", "However, Pitchfork\u2019s review scores contain a small number of significant outliers (the likes of \u2018Dying In Stereo\u2019, \u2018nyc ghosts & flowers\u2019, and \u2018Two Against Nature\u2019), and its kurtosis score suggests that these outlying scores are more extreme than we\u2019d expect (and certainly more extreme than for most other publications).", "All of this supports the idea that Pitchfork is generally a trusted source of music criticism, but that it has a habit of being unnecessarily contrarian to provoke attention.", "This is the first blog in my new \u2018Music By Numbers\u2019 column, which will use data to tell stories about the modern music industry. How are changing genre tastes affecting festivals? What is the future of music journalism? Is making the \u2018Difficult Third Album\u2019 as hard as people think?
