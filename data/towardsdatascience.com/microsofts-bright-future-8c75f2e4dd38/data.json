Also, this is not financial advice.", "Disclaimer 2: Apple reports all of its Mac sales in one category on its Annual Reports, labeled as Mac. It includes desktop sales. In this analysis, I\u2019m assuming that Mac is mostly representative of laptop sales \u2014 who even owns an Apple desktop?", "In December 2017, I took a risk by jumping ship from using Apple\u2019s Macbook Pro to Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book 2. Since that time, I haven\u2019t looked back. I was delightfully surprised at how innovative the Surface Book 2 was compared with the Macbook Pro. Features-wise, Microsoft had outdone itself: it could double as a gigantic, 15\" tablet. It has a beefy NVIDIA graphics card for gaming and graphics/video editing. It also has touch-screen integration so you can easily pair with digital pens. Competing against Apple, Microsoft has found a strong niche to start carving out market share: functional value. And I think that spot is going to win over a lot of future customers for Microsoft. The Surface Book 3 is a great example to highlight the company\u2019s success.", "The part I appreciate the most about Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book 3 release is the fact that they kept the Surface Book 2 users in mind. One of the reasons might be because Microsoft\u2019s strategy for Surface is likely growth, while Apple\u2019s is more focused on retention. This assumption is based on my analysis of Apple and Microsoft\u2019s laptop revenue and market share.", "In 2019, Apple\u2019s net revenue was approximately $261 billion. Out of that, almost $26 billion was from the sale of Mac products (this includes desktop \u2014 but let\u2019s not kid ourselves about Apple\u2019s desktop success). That\u2019s about 10% of their revenue. Comparatively, Microsoft\u2019s total revenue in 2019 was $126 billion, while the Surface lineup accounted for almost $6 billion of that (this also includes Microsoft\u2019s Surface Studio, which is a desktop product \u2014 probably not a big chunk of the revenue), or approximately 5%.", "Taking an elementary view of the market size (assuming Microsoft and Apple are the only players in the laptop market), Apple has 81.4%, while Microsoft has 18.6% \u2014 based on 2019 laptop revenues. Microsoft, as the minority stakeholder in the market share, has more opportunity by trying to increase its slice of the pie by focusing on high-end laptop purchasers it can convert to Surface buyers. Apple, on the other hand, will experience much slower growth (based on percentage) because it is already the market leader in the mature market. And that\u2019s demonstrated by not just revenue, but also by its compound annual growth rate, or CAGR.", "The revenue growth for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line is impressive. Over five years, Microsoft\u2019s Surface sales grew by a 41.2% CAGR, while Apple\u2019s Mac sales grew by 3.2%. It\u2019s easy to compare and see that Microsoft\u2019s growth rate is much better. But avoid that temptation, and instead recognize that Apple has been selling MacBooks since 2006. Microsoft, on the other hand, entered in 2013, so it can afford to be more aggressive, and the resulting aggressive growth rate is understandable . Nevertheless, it\u2019s impressive growth and shows that Microsoft Surface products have been a hit.", "In the spirit of capturing more market share, Microsoft is focusing on convincing more people to get a Surface Book 3. Instead of pressuring its Surface Book 2 users to purchase the newly released Surface Book 3, which could result in bad user experience and potential loss of customers, Microsoft seems to focus more on converting outside users into Surface enthusiasts. Here\u2019s the evidence:", "It could be a coincidence that Microsoft is taking these steps to build out a strategy that conveniently keeps existing Surface Book enthusiasts happy. Still, I think they\u2019re most calculated than that.", "Ever since Microsoft released the first-generation Surface in October 2012, Microsoft has been chipping aggressively at laptop market share. The graph above illustrates the change in market share (albeit an elementary market share only assuming Microsoft and Apple is the entire laptop market) in a span of six years \u2014 from 2013 to 2019. In the year after launching the first Surface Book, Microsoft took 3.8% \u2014 by 2019, that percentage increased by almost 5x to 18.6%.", "A critic may look at the market share graph and complain that just looking at Microsoft vs. Apple isn\u2019t the whole picture, and there\u2019s no guarantee that Microsoft is even competing directly with Apple. Well, yes, I haven\u2019t gotten direct confirmation from Satya Nadella himself that there\u2019s an intention of direct competition. But regardless of if the competition is intentional, the effect can be felt. Take a look at the timeline below.", "Superimposing Apple\u2019s laptop revenue changes with Microsoft\u2019s announcement timeline, we can see that releases of Microsoft\u2019s laptop products do have some potential effect on Apple\u2019s laptop sales. The two worst revenue changes, in 2013 and 2016, were also preceded by major laptop announcements from Microsoft: the first-generation Surface and the first-generation Surface Book, respectively. In 2018, Apple had a small negative growth year for its laptops. Before it, Microsoft announced the Surface Book 2. But who knows \u2014 it could just be that all of these events are just pure coincidence.", "When I gave up my Macbook Pro in 2017, the thing that scared me the most was that I was severing the convenience of integration. By using just Apple products, I could move seamlessly between devices; for example, I could start a conversation on iMessage on my phone, and then jump on my laptop and continue it or vice-versa.", "Fast-forward to 2020, and the only time I use iMessage is to receive text-message verification codes. With the barrage of communication software available, all my real-time text conversations are starting to find its way into WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Discord, WeChat, and Slack. All of those apps are OS-agnostic, so I can jump from mobile to desktop regardless of whether I\u2019m using a Mac or Windows PC.", "The trend is shifting away from iMessage wasn\u2019t just a personal one. Global adoption of other communications technologies is growing quickly. Whatsapp hit 2 billion users in 2020. Slack grew to over 12 million daily active users in Q4 2019. Chinese mobile app WeChat has grown to over 1 billion daily active users. These trends shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise since everyone who doesn\u2019t use Apple products can use these apps to jump from mobile to desktop and other devices seamlessly. The reduced dependency on iMessage, an Apple-exclusive, also reduces the reliance on the overall Apple ecosystem.", "While both companies are international, the most significant percentage of their revenue still comes from North America. The chart below breaks down Apple\u2019s 2019 revenues. The data was collected from Apple\u2019s 2019 Annual Report filed to the SEC. 44.9% of all of its revenue came from North America in 2019. 51.4% of Microsoft\u2019s 2019 revenue came from the United States.", "The current economic conditions of North America, and specifically the United States, is something the world is already familiar. On May 7, CNN reported that \u201c1 in 5 American workers has filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March.\u201d And while there\u2019s debate whether or not the nation is in a recession, CNN also reports that \u201cthe US is already in a recession.\u201d", "Regardless of the economic spending category that the nation is in, the fact remains that people are wary of spending, especially due to the uncertain job conditions (hire freezes, redacted offers, layoffs, and furloughs), coupled with the disappointing stock market performance (although it seems to be recovering nicely). There\u2019s uncertainty around when the country will reopen, and that adds to the pressure of keeping money in pockets, rather than spending. While this pullback in spending may seem to not bode well for Microsoft or Apple at first, there are also two things to keep in mind. First is the lipstick effect.", "\u201cThe lipstick effect is the theory that when facing an economic crisis consumers will be more willing to buy less costly luxury goods. Instead of buying expensive fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive lipstick. The underlying assumption is that consumers will buy luxury goods even if there is a crisis. When consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds. Outside the cosmetics market, consumers could be tempted by expensive beer or smaller, less costly gadgets.\u201d", "I think Apple has an advantage here. Its brand perception is stronger than Microsoft\u2019s when it comes to luxury technology. I don\u2019t have a source for the statement I just made; you can take it as a strong opinion, but I don\u2019t think many people would disagree with it. For those that consider Apple\u2019s brand to be an \u201caffordable\u201d luxury, they may continue to purchase Apple products during an economic downturn. But I also think those will be a minority of purchasers.", "The majority of purchasers during recessions are more likely those who purchase in necessity. This purchase is a bit different because the association of luxury isn\u2019t as significant; instead, people tend to make more informed decisions. I think Microsoft has the advantage here, due to its price range and aforementioned features. That being said, the economic circumstance isn\u2019t ideal for either company, so it isn\u2019t a good thing overall. But it\u2019s an opportunity, however small, for Microsoft to win over users who are starting to think twice about their next expensive Macbook Pro purchase.", "While iMessage isn\u2019t as important anymore (discussed previously), the rest of the Apple ecosystem can create some dependency or even vendor lock-in. For example, subscription to iCloud and using it as cloud storage may lock users into continuing to purchase Apple products, since iCloud isn\u2019t as easy to use outside of them.", "Also, heavy users of Apple-only functionality such as AirDrop may enjoy the ease of being able to share images and videos with just a click between mobile a desktop. Losers like myself, who have a smorgasbord of Apple and Microsoft products, need to go through a few extra clicks (sending photos and videos to myself on Slack or email, and then opening it up on my desktop). While a few extra clicks don\u2019t sound like a lot, it adds up and makes a big difference for user experience.", "User experience is one of those things that, if you haven\u2019t thought about it, then just hearing about it sounds unbelievable. User experience experts know the famous Google claim that more than 50% of users will leave a mobile site if it doesn\u2019t load in less than three seconds. Three seconds doesn\u2019t sound like a lot at first, especially to veterans of the dial-up era (hit me up on AIM).", "But if you don\u2019t believe that, then next time you unlock your phone, just count to three before you click anything. I bet you\u2019ll get impatient. We\u2019re anxious, especially when it comes to getting what we want from technology. Companies like Apple worked very hard to make things very simple for us, so there\u2019s certainly a high standard when it comes to getting what we want \u2014 whether it\u2019s load time, clicks, or just understanding how to use something.", "Apple has done a fantastic job of delivering beautiful, minimalist hardware designs with great user experiences. That\u2019s why I still stick with iPhones, and I don\u2019t have any intention of switching. Microsoft, though, has been making some really aggressive moves to improve user experience and also beautiful design. At this point, I wouldn\u2019t say Microsoft lacks in this compared to Apple, but Microsoft will have to spend more resources convincing new potential customers that it plays just as well in this arena.", "I\u2019m excited to watch the next several years of Microsoft unfold, and I hope that the strategy of the Surface products is a sneak peek into the overall path that Microsoft wants to chart for itself. Financially, the Surface launch as been a great success. On the features side, Microsoft has strategically pushed the new-generation Surface Book release to not pressure existing users to upgrade, which may come off as too aggressive. The company is pushing forward with a bold and respectful strategy that is working.", "Your home for data science.
