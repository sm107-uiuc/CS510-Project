I will briefly describe basic objects such as qubit and quantum gate but I suggest you to learn them in a wider frame work. Basically quantum computer appeared in the early 80\u2019s when the legendary physicist Richard Feynman \u201cchallenged\u201dcomputer scientist to develop a computer that is based on quantum physics. The main motivation was the understanding that simulation quantum systems is impossible :process are always exponential in the number of particles. Feynman was also concern whether quantum computing is at least as universal as classical computing. An additional motivation appeared as engineers learned that chips miniaturization begins to suffer quantum effects. In the last decades quantum computing is often associated with NP problems and whether quantum computing makes them tractable.", "Qubit- The basic unit of quantum computing.
