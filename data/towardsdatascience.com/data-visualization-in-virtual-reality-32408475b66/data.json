It has become a massive and integral part of data science today. Key stakeholders respond better to clean and clear visuals as opposed to raw data, as they help in understanding information quickly and effectively. There are a large number of visualization libraries currently in use with matplotlib (Python) and ggplot2 (R) being the standouts.", "These libraries, however, have not yet made a significant breakthrough into the virtual reality space. As technology makes promising strides into virtual and augmented reality, it is essential that users can experience data visualizations in AR/VR as well. With this in mind, the objective of this project is the exploration and creation of data visualizations in virtual reality.", "The goal is to make it easier for everyone to get into VR experiences, no matter what device they have. WebVR is picked as the optimal medium for this very reason. WebVR is an experimental JavaScript application programming interface (API) that provides support for virtual reality devices. It is an open specification that also makes it possible to experience VR in a browser. One needs two things to experience WebVR: a headset and a compatible browser.", "A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. But A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js. A-Frame can be developed from a plain HTML file without having to install anything. Alternatively, one can create an HTML file and include A-Frame in the <head> as shown in Fig 1.", "A-Frame is built on top of the DOM so most libraries and frameworks work. This includes D3.js, which is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps bring data to life using HTML, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). D3\u2019s emphasis on web standards gives the user the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying themselves to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. For example, one can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers or use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.", "The objective of this visualization is to read data from a URL that contains a static JSON file and create a bar chart in VR. The initial point of the camera would be at the centre of the chart with the various bars placed around it. Two files would be required to construct this visualization \u2014 an HTML file that defines the body of the page using A-Frame entities, and a Javascript file that performs the visualization after reading the data. The JSON file that contains the data to be visualized is depicted in Fig 2.", "In order to read data like the JSON file above from a URL, it is necessary to use XMLHttpRequest. XMLHttpRequest is a built-in browser object that allows to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. Despite having the word \u201cXML\u201d in its name, it can operate on any data, including JSON, HTML or plain text. One can upload/download files, track progress and use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. The user can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a complete page refresh. This enables a web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.", "In Fig 3 above, the following steps are carried out: -", "After formulating the visualization function and linking the Javascript file with the HTML file, an error still occurs. The reason is the presence of the \u2018require\u2019 method in the first line of the code snippet. The \u2018require\u2019 method is used to include the module in the project and use it as the browser-based XHR object. The issue is that while Node.js has the \u2018require\u2019 method defined, browsers don\u2019t. With Browserify, one can write code that uses \u2018require\u2019 in the same way that one would use it in Node. In order to use this functionality, these steps are followed: -", "The function that takes care of the DOM manipulation and data visualization gets the data from the XHR API. The data is pushed into arrays and is then scaled in order to fit the screen. The A-Frame \u2018a-scene\u2019 is selected and the \u2018a-cube\u2019 bars are appended to it. Following this, the various attributes of the bars such as the height, width, position and rotation were defined. The \u2018mouseenter\u2019 and \u2018mouseleave\u2019 animations were also defined using the \u2018transition\u2019 method \u2014 this facilitates the expansion and lighting up of a bar when hovered upon. Lastly, the labels that go underneath the bars in the visualization were composed, along with the required attributes. A snapshot of the final visualization is displayed in Fig 4.", "The first visualization can only read data from a static JSON file. It would be more practical and useful if the visualization could read data that changes dynamically. This is the objective of the second visualization. It will borrow the basic structure and functions of Visualization I while adding the ability to update itself in real time.", "In this visualization, since the data is not being sourced from a static JSON file, the use of XMLHttpRequest and Browserify is not required. Instead, the data is obtained from Google Firebase\u2019s Cloud Firestore. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. It keeps the data synced across client apps through real-time listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so that the user can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. For this visualization, the \u2018expenses\u2019 collection with multiple documents is used, as seen in Fig 5.", "For the visualization to access the data within the Cloud Firestore database, a <script> is included in the HTML file. In it, the user\u2019s web app Firebase configuration details are specified. The database is initialized and accessed as \u2018db\u2019 using the code in Fig 6.", "The code in Fig 7 below explains how the program deals with changes in data. Each entry in the collection is of type \u2018added\u2019, \u2018modified\u2019 or \u2018removed\u2019. The switch statement in the code deals with each of these cases by manipulating the input data. Once the data is redefined, it is passed into the function that handles the visualization.", "As alluded to earlier, the main designing function of the second visualization is borrowed from the first. The scene, bars and labels are constructed in a similar fashion with the same attributes. One added feature is that the colour of the bars is now based on a condition \u2014 purple if the value is greater than 50, and blue otherwise. However, the key added component in this visualization is the text annotation, which is fashioned as a second label that is seen above each of the bars. These annotations represent the height of the bar and appear only when the mouse hovers over a bar. This allows the viewer to comprehend the relative values and visualize the data more effectively.", "The same visualization was first created in regular D3, without the use of A-Frame VR. This was done to test the interaction with the Cloud Firestore database and to be used as a reference for the VR visualization. The 2D visualization is displayed in Fig 8.", "Once it was observed that the above visualization updated itself in real-time, it was translated to the virtual reality space as presented in Fig 9 below: -", "The objective of this project was to study the possibilities of visualizing data in virtual reality. To achieve this, the key components that needed to be understood were WebVR, A-Frame and D3. WebVR was the medium through which the user could experience the visualizations, A-Frame provided the tools to set up the VR scene and entities, while D3 enabled DOM manipulation and definition of various visualization attributes.", "In Visualization I, the data was read from a static JSON file using XMLHttpRequest and Browserify, and its corresponding bar chart was generated. Visualization II emulated the first in basic functionality but sourced the data from Google Firebase\u2019s Cloud Firestore. Along with being able to read dynamic data from a database, Visualization II also had custom annotations that appeared when the mouse hovered over a bar. This allowed the user to understand the values and relative heights of the bars, thereby experiencing an effective visualization of the data. Therefore, it was seen that with the right tools and approach, data can be effectively visualized in the virtual reality space.", "This project only dealt with bar charts using A-Frame\u2019s \u2018a-cube\u2019 entity. A lot of different types of visualizations can be built using various other entities. For example, pie charts and donut charts can be crafted using \u2018a-cylinder\u2019 and \u2018a-torus\u2019 entities respectively. The current visualizations are demonstrated on the web using an HTML file from a local directory. In future, these can be published online as websites using the services of Google, GitHub, GoDaddy, etc. These would allow the ability to share visualizations across the internet and would also facilitate collaboration.", "During the course of this project, it was discovered that there exists very little material on the subject at hand. Since data visualization has not yet made a serious entrance into the virtual and augmented reality domain, this research project can hopefully take the conversation forward in the near future.", "The work above was done as part of a Directed Research Project under the guidance of Dr. Saty Raghavachary at the University of Southern California.", "You can find the GitHub repository of my project here and the visualizations below: -", "Your home for data science.
