This meant Liverpool FC will no longer be participating in UEFA Champions League for the rest of the season. Moreover, this resulted in the end of our unbeaten home run which lasted for three seasons.", "This also marked the beginning of something significant, the temporary end of football in Europe. As the coronavirus pandemic started to spread like a wildfire globally, most European football leagues started to close down and indefinitely postpone any sporting events. Thus, there will be no football for the next two to three months.", "For me, it was a terrible way to go out because of that bitter loss. Soccer clubs across Europe started to do multiple testing to know if their players and staff members were infected with covid-19 or not. As they tested their players and staff, they reported the testing results online about who got it and what are the next steps.", "Seeing many soccer professionals (staff and players) contracting covid-19 and how it spread across Europe led me to conduct research to find out how covid-19 affected European leagues in the big five football countries: England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. I had to read multiple articles to find out who contracted covid-19.", "One article that proved very helpful can be found here. It provides a great deal of information in terms of the name, team, age, league, role in the team and the condition. I decided to go ahead and insert all these details row by row into a google spreadsheet.", "After recording 86 cases, I hit a roadblock because every other article I read didn\u2019t provide any details on the demographics of the people contracting the virus. The headline just read \u201cAfter another round of testing, X number of people tested positive for covid-19.\u201d I went ahead and started to plot graphs that show how covid-19 affected different leagues. The graphs I created can be viewed below.", "The average age of soccer professionals who contracted covid-19 in Germany is 23.5, which is the least. The second least was France with 25.5. Italy was right in the middle with 27.5. United Kingdom had an average age of 35.8. The highest was Spain and it had 36.33.", "Across the five major soccer countries, Spanish La Liga recorded the highest number of cases, 32. In second place, we have Serie A which recorded 19 cases. Premier League came third with 17. Bundesliga was fourth with 7. Among the last three were the top 2 divisions in France which are Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. Both recorded one case. The legend, on the top right corner, shows the location of the leagues.", "Alaves was hit heavily as fifteen members of its organization contracted covid-19. Espanyol, which is also in Spain got hit badly with eleven people getting diagnosed with covid-19. Third was Sampdoria of Italy which recorded eight cases. Valencia and Bournemouth came fourth with a tally of 5 cases.", "In this project, I leveraged Tableau to create a map that showed the average age of soccer professionals who contracted covid-19 by country. I also built a bar graph to show how many cases were recorded in different leagues. Finally, I used a horizontal bar graph to rank individual teams based on how many people contracted coronavirus.", "Combining these three charts, I was able to build an interactive dashboard and deploy it via Tableau Public. This interactive dashboard can be viewed here.", "Tableau: Unleashing the Power of Visual Analytics", "What Happened in the Premier League this season", "Your home for data science.
