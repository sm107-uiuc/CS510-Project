After thoroughly going through various sources, I found out that the history of neural networks piqued my interest, and I became engrossed. I had a lot of fun because researching this topic was gratifying. Below is the list of the table of contents. Feel free to skip to the topic which fascinates you the most.", "Neural networks and artificial intelligence have been a popular topic since the past century. The popularity of artificial intelligence robots taking over the world in pop culture movies has undeniably intrigued a lot of curious minds. Neural Networks withdraw inspiration from biological neurons. Neural networks are a programming paradigm inspired means which enable deep learning models to learn and train effectively on complex observational datasets. Neural networks have been through various phases during the past century. Neural networks went from being a strong prospect for solving complex computational problems, then being ridiculed to only a theoretical idea, and finally, prominent for a more desirable future. Let us revisit each stage in the history of neural networks in chronological order.", "Note: This will be the very first part of the series titled \u201cEverything About Deep Learning.\u201d In this topic, we will try to cover every single fact, algorithm, activation functions, and what the future holds for artificial neural networks as well as deep learning. Today, we will start with the complete history of neural networks. In the next parts, we will cover the basics that enable the functioning of neurons, and in subsequent parts, we will cover all the concepts related to deep learning.", "Biologists, neurologists, and researchers have been working on the functionally of neurons since the past century. William James, an American philosopher in 1890, proposed an insightful theory that reflected the subsequent work of many researchers. The hypothesis, in simple terms, states that the activity at any given point in the brain cortex is the sum of tendencies from the overall movement discharged into it. Elaborating briefly, on the following statement, it means that the excitement of one neuron excites every other neuron until the signal has successfully reached the target.", "The credit to developing the first mathematical model for a single neuron goes to McCulloch and Pitts in the year 1943. The neuron model constructed was comprehensive and far-reaching. This model built has been modified and widely used even in the modern era. This moment brought upon a colossal shift in the minds of researchers and practitioners of neural networks. The mathematical functioning of a neuron model similar to the human brain was flabbergasting to most biologists. The support bandwagon for AI to be successful and concerns over AI taking over the world started from this moment onwards.", "We will also look at each of these concepts in further detail over the next series of tutorials. Understanding each concept of neural networks from scratch, including the working of a single neuron, will also be accomplished over the series.", "Over the next two decades ranging from 1949 to 1969, a wide array of experiments were performed and handled. There were massive developments and expansions in existing methodologies. It would not be wrong to say that this period was the golden era of neural networks. This era started with a bang thanks to the Hebbian theory introduced by Donald Hebb in his book titled \u201cThe Organization of Behavior.\u201d In simple terms, the Hebbian theory states that the conductance increases with repeated activation of one neuron by another, across a particular synapse.", "During this phase, there were several evolutions in salient topics like learning filters, gradient descent, developments in neurodynamics, and triggering and propagation of large-scale brain activity. There was extensive research in synchronous activation of multiple neurons to represent each bit of information. Information theory with principles of Shannon\u2019s entropy became an important area for the field of research. However, the most significant invention was the Perceptron model by Rosenblatt in the year 1958.", "The perceptron model is one of the most substantial discoveries in neural networks. The methods of backpropagation introduced by Rosenblatt were useful for training multi-layered networks. This era was candidly the golden era for neural networks due to the extensive research and continuous developments. Taylor constructed a winner-take-all circuit, with inhibition among output units and other progressions in the perceptron model were also accomplished.", "There were many topics researched and investigated during the 1970s to 1990s. Unfortunately, the developments were of no avail. There was research in combinations of many neurons to form neural networks to become more powerful than a single neuron and perform complex computations. Since gradient descent was not successful in obtaining desired solutions to complex tasks, the development of other mathematical random, probabilistic, or stochastic methods became necessary. Further theoretical results and analysis became established during this time frame.", "The Boltzmann machines and hybrid systems for complex computational problems were also successfully done during the advancements period. Boltzmann machines successfully combated the issue of mathematical problems. Achieving solutions to various drawbacks could not be accomplished due to hardware and software limitations. Nonetheless, during this period, a significant amount of successful research was conducted. Updates and improvements to existing studies became established during this time frame.", "However, despite these advancements, nothing was crucial or fruitful to the development of neural networks. The burgeoning demand for artificial neural networks no longer existed. One of the significant reasons for this was due to the demonstration of the limitations of a simple perceptron. Minsky and Papert, in 1969, conducted this demonstration and showcased the flaws of a simple perceptron. It theoretically proved that the simple perceptron model was not computationally universal. This moment was infamous as it marked a black day for neural networks. There was a drastic reduction in funding support for the research in the field of neural networks. This motion kickstarted the fall of neural networks.", "The hype for Artificial neural networks was at an all-time peak during this time, but in due time all the hype related to neural networks just vanished. Artificial intelligence being the next big thing, was no longer the talking point for intellectuals. Artificial Neural networks and deep learning became ridiculed to only a theoretical concept. The main reasons for this were due to the lack of data and advanced technologies.", "At that time, there were not enough resources for the computation of complex tasks like image segmentation, image classification, face recognition, natural language processing based chatbots, etc. The data available during this time was quite limited, and there wasn\u2019t enough data for a complex neural network architecture to provide the desired result. Albeit, even with the required data, it would be an incredibly challenging task to compute that amount of data with the resources available at that time.", "There were signs of optimism like the success in reinforcement learning and other smaller positives. Unfortunately, this was not good enough to rebuild the massive hype it once had. Thanks to the researchers and scientists with their extraordinary visions were able to continue developments in the field of artificial neural networks. However, for artificial neural networks to regain their lost prestige and hype, it would take another 20 years.", "The next two decades were dry for the state and popularity of deep learning. During this era, the support vector machines (SVM\u2019s) and other similar machine learning algorithms were more dominant and practiced to solve complex tasks. The machine learning algorithms performed well for most datasets, but with bigger datasets, the performance of the machine learning algorithms did not significantly improve. The machine learning algorithm\u2019s performance after a certain threshold was stagnant. Models that could learn and improve continuously with the increasing data became important.", "In 2012, a team led by George E. Dahl won the \u201cMerck Molecular Activity Challenge\u201d using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014, Hochreiter\u2019s group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products, and drugs and won the \u201cTox21 Data Challenge\u201d of NIH, FDA, and NCATS. (Reference: Wiki)", "A revolutionary moment started at this precise moment, and deep neural networks were now considered a game-changer. Deep learning and neural networks are now the salient features contemplated for any high-level competitions. Convolutional neural networks, long short term memory (LSTM\u2019s), and generative adversarial networks are exceedingly popular.", "The aggrandizement of deep learning is rapidly increasing each day especially, with vast improvements. It is exciting to see what the future withholds for deep neural networks and artificial intelligence.", "The journey of neural networks is one to remember for the upcoming ages. Neural networks and deep learning went from a fantastic prospect to now becoming one of the best methods of solving almost any complex problem whatsoever. I am thrilled to see the advancements that will take place in the deep learning field, and I am delighted that I am a part of the current generation who can contribute to this change.", "Most of the viewers reading this article are probably fascinated as well. I will try to cover every topic from the history of neural networks to the working and understanding of every deep learning algorithm and architecture in the series titled \u201cEverything About DL.\u201d Let\u2019s stick together on this journey and conquer deep learning.
