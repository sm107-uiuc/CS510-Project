You can create any dummy app, give it whatever name you want to and Spotify will spit out a client Id and client secret key for you.", "You can use the client ID and the secret key to access the data stored in songs, playlists etc.", "Once you are equipped with the arsenal, you need a target to attack and here I will attack my playlist. I merely need its URI and Spotify provides it meekly.", "Right-click on the three horizontal dots in front of a playlist\u2019s name and go to share and from there you will have the Spotify URI which will be of the format \u2018spotify:playlist:r34c3tgghrfhwforo45\u2019", "Provide your playlist URI, client Id and client secret to Spotify Web API that will create an object of spotipy with help of your credentials.", "At the bottom of the JSON object, you can see the total number of songs in your playlist.", "Let\u2019s extract the track Ids and the respective names from the playlist. Spotipy has an ample number of examples on its Github repo. Please check it here.", "Spotify\u2019s web API doesn\u2019t allow to read more than 100 objects at a time, so one has to keep updating an offset variable.", "Cool! So, I have the track names and track Ids here. Let me push that in a dictionary and create a pandas dataframe. Also, there would be a few null values in this dataframe because I have travelled from one place to the other and many songs that I added to my playlist in 2012 might not be available in the region I am at (I really have a bone to pick with Spotify on this matter, why can\u2019t I see my own content in different geographies even when I am a premium user and why am I plastered with local channels and playlists? I don\u2019t even know the language or enjoy that type of music)", "Let\u2019s see how the dataframe looks.", "Now comes the meat of the process. Spotify has many quantitative variables to describe the music such as energy, danceability, popularity, speechiness, tempo etc", "It\u2019s easier to create a dataframe from the dictionary above. I used the lame name for my dataframe :) Mea culpa! Add the track name as well from one of the previous steps.", "Hmm\u2026there is a lot of quantitative info here, interesting!!", "I want to see how these songs look on a reduced dimension scale, essentially I want to create embedding of these features. Hmm\u2026but I know only of word embedding using Glove or word2vec.", "Wait! Isn\u2019t TSNE representation kind of embedding only? I believe so. Ok, let\u2019s try this out.", "First I need to drop the non-numerical columns i.e. URI and Name. Another requirement is to scale the data, I will use standard scaler for ease of use. Standard scaling is done w.r.t. mean and standard deviation and it is done to fit the data in more or less normal/Gaussian distribution.", "Now, I am ready to compute the TSNE. As I want to plot a 2D graph, I will use the number of components as 2.", "TSNE when computed takes a while and produces the following logs:", "Let\u2019s look at the dataset \u2018tsne_results\u2019 that we will use to plot.", "To plot TSNE, I can use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, or Plotly.", "There can be some insights hidden so I need to add a few colours.", "So, there is a pattern after all. A plotly based TSNE plot is more revealing. The slow-paced ones are in the bottom right corner, others are spread throughout. It could be the case that my playlist suffers the bias that they have only one type of song. That isn\u2019t so bad, to be honest, playlists are indeed biased.", "Now, the time to reveal the truth. I think that I prefer classical rock bands Thanks to overexposure to Linkin Park, System of a Down, Metallica, Creedence Clearwater Revival etc but let the data talk.", "Once that\u2019s achieved, I want to rescale the values from 0 to 1, essentially normalise them.", "Now we have all the data to build a radar plot.", "The big reveal is that my song choices dominate in the high energy area which indicates that EDM, poptimism, and modern rock that are more beat-based and thus help in focus, dominate the playlist.", "A helper function that will calculate the cosine distance between the TSNE values can help in finding which songs are closer to each other.", "The df_temp dataset contains the songs that are closer to the song I am interested in.", "This is interesting because almost all these songs repeat an undertone that I fixate to.", "Based on the preference of the music, one can decipher the underlying psychographics as well.", "To test this above approach further I should ideally have a large set that includes the songs that I haven\u2019t listened to before and then I can assert whether this TSNE based cosine similarity will work. Another thing that can be done is to develop a classifier that will predict the songs in the test dataset as like/dislike.", "PS: The code repo is present on my Github or holler at my LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
