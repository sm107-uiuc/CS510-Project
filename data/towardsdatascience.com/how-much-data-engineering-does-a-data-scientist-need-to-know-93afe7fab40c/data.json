Every company wants to do some of this famous Data Science and the topic remains one of the highest-priorities for companies turning to AI in 2019. However, in practice, the challenge proves to be very difficult and Data Science often remains a very distant goal that many never seem to reach.", "The last few years have shown that Data Engineering, an essential step prior to Data Science & AI, remains a step that many companies totally miss, rush or ignore. In consequence, many Data Scientists end up doing the job of Data Engineers and barely have any time or opportunities to build valuable Data Science projects.", "When it comes to separating the job of a Data Engineer & a Data Scientist, the line can be a little blurry. It can confuse companies into hiring the wrong person for the job, thereby frustrating their Data Scientists.", "Data Scientists & Data Engineers frequently have overlaps in their knowledge. Overlapping knowledge is good, since both need to be able to communicate and help each other. They should understand each other\u2019s decision and each other\u2019s tasks for the cooperation to be as smooth as possible.", "With the rise of Google Cloud, AWS & Microsoft Azure, knowledge of cloud infrastructures has become extremely valuable for any Data Scientist. Companies using these platforms will often encourage their Data Science team to use their cloud infrastructure to develop their models and even deploy them into production\u00a0using\u00a0CI/CD\u00a0pipelines.", "However, Data Scientists do NOT need to know how to set up the whole infrastructure or pipeline by themselves. Again, it is not their job. However, knowing what the pipeline consists of, and knowing how to run a model \u201cin the cloud\u201d can come in really handy. For instance, the development and/or deployment of heavy Machine Learning models can require the use of clusters, virtual machines or containers. Therefore, it would be handy to know how to handle these services.", "Even though I am not a big fan of ready-made Data Science solutions, I must mention that cloud infrastructures now have rather advanced Machine Learning Platforms. They often integrate easily with other cloud services from the same provider and can be a good option for an easy proof of concept.", "Spark will commonly be part of the overlap that Data Scientists & Data Engineers will\u00a0show\u00a0as\u00a0they\u00a0would\u00a0both\u00a0use\u00a0it\u00a0for\u00a0different\u00a0purposes. Apache Spark is a very popular and powerful data processing engine that allows data parallelism. For Data Scientists, Spark (or PySpark for Python users) can be used to apply machine learning models on very large volumes of data (including streaming data!) while Data Engineers will use it to build reliable data pipelines.", "SQL has been around for quite a while, and relational databases remain popular and essential in many businesses. Any Data Scientist should have some basics in SQL to be able to query data from any SQL database. Having some basic knowledge of Data Warehouses can help as well. However, Data Scientists are NOT responsible for generating SQL reports nor for maintaining or improving data quality in the databases.", "While extensive knowledge of Linux might not be needed, basic knowledge of Linux is very useful for any Data Scientist! Indeed, Data Scientists might be required to develop and run their experiments on remote servers or clusters with Linux as an operating system. Moreover, the operating system is very popular with the cloud providers I mentioned before. Linux runs on most of the powerful remote machines and certain software or packages (e.g. AirFlow) will be much less of a pain to install and run on this operating system. For the same reasons, the code of a Data Scientist is very likely to be deployed on a Linux machine once in Production. In short, if you are a Data Scientist, knowing your way around Linux and the command line will be of great value.", "Airflow is an open-source scheduling tool used to automate workflows. It provides a visual interface and is Python-based. It can be used to schedule ETL tasks but can prove handy for Data Scientists as well. While ETL jobs are NOT their responsibility, Data Scientists can make use of Airflow\u2019s functionalities to automate their data processing for any Machine Learning model. If you have not yet heard about Apache Airflow, the article below provides a great overview of the tool.", "The field combining Data Science & Data Engineering is constantly changing & adapting to the challenges that arise. While Data Scientists should keep an eye on the evolution of Data Engineering & some of the tools involved, they will rarely need advanced knowledge in most of the mentioned software or systems. It is quite unreasonable to require a Data Scientist to have advanced knowledge in Data Engineering and the tools involved. However, any data scientist will appreciate these skills in due time. Often, growth does not come from continuously getting new skills. It comes from gathering the right skills.", "Your home for data science.
