It should open in the current userspace. My user here is called \u2018konki\u2019.", "This is the window where you will be typing your commands!!!", "***Note that the commands I will be showing here are valid for MacOS and other Unix operating systems. If you are using Windows Command Prompt most of these commands should work but other ones may need some alternation.", "The first command will show you the current directory that you are in. Just type \u2018pwd\u2019 as shown below:", "You can see that I am now in \u2018/Users/konki\u2019 directory.", "This command list all files in a directory. Let\u2019s have a look.", "You can see I have eleven directories and no files (if I had some files you would see names with some extensions. e.g .txt. or .py)", "You can use ls with -a parameter to show hidden files:", "It looks like I have quite a lot of hidden files. Those are the ones starting with a dot (.).", "You can also inspect the content of the folder that you are not currently in by passing its relative path.", "The command above should list the contents of the Desktop directory.", "This command is used to create a new directory. The following line of code creates a new directory in the current folder named test.", "You can use \u2018ls\u2019 command to check if this has been created.", "This command is used to change directory to the one with the path given. Once you have created \u2018test\u2019 directory you should be able to enter into it.", "You can confirm where you are by using \u2018pwd\u2019 command as above.", "Other useful variations of \u2018cd\u2019 command are \u2018cd\u2019 (without an argument) and \u2018cd~\u2019 . They will both take you to the home directory.", "Also, the common use of \u2018cd\u2019 is to return to the parent directory that can be done with two dots.", "You can use this to create a new file. The code below creates my_file.py. and then uses \u2018ls\u2019 command to check the content of the directory.", "The file we have created is just an empty file with .py extension. We could add some python code there later on.", "We can remove files or directories with the remove command. With the file, it is enough to call this command with the filename as shown below.", "You can always confirm if the file was removed with the \u2018ls\u2019 command as above.", "If you want to remove a whole directory you would have to add -r parameter. This would make remove command to work recursively and enter all subdirectories to delete their content as well.", "You can move files and directories around with the command \u2018mv\u2019. You just need to specify a file or folder name you want to move and the new desired location (folder or filename).", "Let\u2019s create a new file and move it to the parent directory.", "The last line moves the file.txt to the parent directory. Remember, two dots(..) are the shortcut for the parent directory.", "You can also copy files and folders instead of moving them. The structure of the command is similar to move command. You need to specify the file you want to copy and the destination.", "Let\u2019s create a new file and copy it to the parent directory.", "Now if you use \u2018ls\u2019 command you will see that the file is still in its original location.", "If you go back to the parent folder with \u2018cd ..\u2019 and use \u2018ls\u2019 again you will see that \u2018file_to_copy.txt\u2019 is there as well. It got copied over there without deleting the original file.", "This command is useful when you forgot how to use any of the commands presented above. It pulls up a manual for a particular command.", "You can test in on \u2018pwd\u2019 command.", "This should open a description of the \u2018pwd\u2019 command as shown on the screenshot below.", "You can scroll down with the arrow to access the text on the bottom and type \u2018q\u2019 to exit the text file.", "I think this is a list of commands that I most often use while navigating my Macbook and working on projects. It saves me a lot of time and effort in comparison to doing all of these using graphical user interfaces.", "Start with learning those nine and work towards using the command line on an everyday basis.", "Originally published at aboutdatablog.com: Terminal for Data Scientists, on August 26, 2020.", "PS: I am writing articles that explain basic Data Science concepts in a simple and comprehensible manner on Medium and aboutdatablog.com.
