Many research papers are being published in this area which makes it even more interesting! and \u201cIt's quite troublesome for beginners to start in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning on HSI\u201d as it has limited exposure to the community when compared to other Machine Learning(ML) techniques in computer vision such as Object Detection, Face Recognition, GAN\u2019s, Auto-encoders, e.t.c.", "This post provides information that assists beginners to get started on Hyperspectral Image(HSI) analysis from data collection to data visualization and analysis and using interactive data visualization tools using Python.", "In Remote Sensing, Hyperspectral remote sensors are widely used for monitoring the earth\u2019s surface with the high spectral resolution. Hyperspectral Image(HSI) data often contains hundreds of spectral bands over the same spatial area which provide valuable information to identify the various materials. In HSI, each pixel can be regarded as a high dimensional vector whose entries correspond to the spectral reflectance from visible to infrared.", "The acquisition and collection of hyperspectral data have become much easier and affordable, making hyperspectral image analysis to be one of the promising techniques in many applications including Precise Agriculture, Environmental Analysis, Military Surveillance, Mineral Exploration, Urban Investigation, e.t.c.", "The Classification of Hyperspectral Images is the task of classifying a class label of every pixel in an image that was captured using the hyperspectral sensors. This blog focuses on data collection, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.", "Here comes the tough part, there are no popular data sources for HSI which makes the difficult task for beginners to get started in HSI analysis. Here are the few data sources for HSI.", "The Hyperspectral Image(HSI) data is mostly available in the format of .mat files. Which cab be accessed using different programming languages and the blog uses python.", "Extracting pixels of the HSI is one of the important preprocessing tasks. This makes easier to handle the data and also to implement machine learning algorithms such as classification, clustering e.t.c.", "The Pavia University Dataset is utilized for illustration purposes. The HSI scene acquired by the ROSIS sensor during a flight campaign over Pavia, northern Italy. The number of spectral bands is 103, the size of HSI is 610*340 pixels, the ground truth contains 9 classes. Some of the pixels in images contain no information and have to be discarded before the analysis. The geometric resolution is 1.3 meters. Here are the few sample bands from the Pavia University HSI.", "By using the Scientific Python(SciPy) python library, we can read the dataset. The below code is used in order to read the dataset.", "The function returns the data and the ground truth or classes and also displays the size of the data and ground truth which are 3D and 2D matrices.", "The pixels are the individual elements in the Hyperspectral Image(HSI) which is a vector with the length equals to the number of bands of the HSI. The below code is used to extract the pixels from HSI and saves into the CSV file and returns the pandas data frame.", "It is hard to process the data which is huge, as the Pavia University dataset has high dimensions. So the dimensions of the data are reduced to 3D using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) which is a popular and widely used dimensionality reduction technique. The below code is used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset into three.", "The above code results in a data frame with columns as three principal components(PC) and class. Let\u2019s see a few interactive visualizations to inspect the patterns in data.", "It is hard to visualize all the patterns in the dataset as it contains nearly 45k. So, sampling the data is the best way to visualize all the data points or observations or pixels. The plots are depicted using 200 samples from each class randomly except for the countplot.", "2. 3D Scatter Plot: It plots the data points on a three-dimensional axis to show the relationship between three variables. The below figure represents a relationship between principal components(PC1, PC2, and PC3) in the form of a 3D scatter plot.", "3. 3D Line plot: It is quite similar to the 3D scatter plot but the difference is that every data point is connected with a line. The below graph shows the visualization of the data in the format of the 3D line plot. Here we can see that projection of classes is considerably good even using the linear dimensionality reduction technique(PCA).", "4. Area Plot: It represents the change of one variable w.r.t the other variable connecting the data points with line segments. The visualization w.r.t the Principal Components(PC1, PC2, and PC3) are shown below:", "These are the few types of interactive visualizations.", "Now, you know where to find HSI data, how to read and convert and different ways to visualize the data or patterns.", "If you\u2019re interested in the code that is show in the post, you can access using the below link:", "The next blog will introduce the different classifications algorithms used in the classification of HSI.", "Your home for data science.
