A brilliant and essential tool is Github, this gives us the ability to manage our code, version control, and collaborate with others. Not only data scientists, but anyone who does programming for their personal or work projects will use Github (or another Git repository hosting service).", "Beyond the dedicated purpose of using repositories to push your work to, Github also works as a great portfolio for your technical projects or a great medium for your colleagues at a work place to read your code and reports. As a candidate applying for positions in data science a great way to show you have project experience would be by having a link to your Github, where potential employers can see the project brief, your code, and the outcome of the projects you have contributed to. Another case is within a company you are working at, your contribution to a project might be looked at by a non-technical person, a senior technical person, or someone junior to you. For all of these different groups of people your repository should be easy to follow and understandable.", "I want to go over techniques and tips on how to create a great Github repository, from coding practices, using jupyter notebooks effectively, and having a detailed README. I will use my images from my Github repository for my Hilton Hotel NLP project. Here is a link to see the full repository: https://github.com/awesomeahi95/Hotel_Review_NLP", "Python is the language predominantly used in data science, and there are many different IDEs you can use to code in Python, but for creating a structured report with clean code and annotations, Jupyter Notebooks are the way forward. Here are some tips to make your notebook more accessible:", "Use markdowns: If your code is long or complex it would be very useful to have markdown titles, subtitles, and descriptions for the bits of code you have been working on. By doing this a non-technical person or someone who isn\u2019t has adept as you in coding can understand why such steps are being taken, and what some cells are doing.", "Keep all your imports at the top: If someone needs to know what libraries, python scripts, or datasets are being imported into a notebook, put them at the top. This makes it much easier for someone reading your notebook to know what are the libraries that are needed or repo files needed for this notebook to run prior ro running it.", "Use visualisations with Seaborn poster context: Visualisations is a must in data science reporting \u2014 what better way to communicate your findings. But we can improve these visualisations with seaborn\u2019s context \u2018poster\u2019, this makes the visualisation more bold and with clearer text. This makes matplotlib visualisations look better as well.", "Make it digestable and easy to navigate: Using subtitle markdowns with numbers like 1.4.2 makes it easier to follow the steps taken in the notebook. For a given notebook you maybe performing certain tasks to your data, if there is a sequence of cells achieving one task, putting that under a numbered subtitle can help to both navigate up and down the notebook and to understand exactly what the next few cells are dedicated to achieving.", "Use multiple notebooks for one report: This may not be possible for all projects as some companies may have certain rules with coding practices and only choose to use one notebook but otherwise, this can be very useful. When structuring a data science project, there are usually clear stages, such as EDA and modelling. For all these stages you can dedicate each stage a notebook. Not only does this make it more digestable, but someone else can run one notebook for a specific stage instead of running a single long notebook.", "I\u2019d also recommend saving each dataframe/dataset or model created in a notebook at the end, and saving them in folder for data or models in your repo, then import them back in the notebook used for the next stage. This helps with going back to older versions of manipulated data and models.", "Create python scripts for functions and classes: Try to keep your notebooks more goal driven by keeping it more about the steps taken and why, as those parts are what you would want to see when taking a quick look. Keep the functions and classes saved in scripts which can be imported into your notebook for use. This does not mean the functions and classes are not important, they are very important to a technical person assessing the quality of your code. So make sure your python scripts are well written and have detailed documentation.", "In terms of simplifying and summarising everything that is going on inside you project repository, READMEs are the perfect way of achieving this. As soon as a person opens your repository, under the files the first thing you can see is your README markdown. This is great for potential employers to look at, your non-technical colleagues, and your technical colleagues. This is where you aim to explain what you intentions were for the project, and you can include the context for why this project is being done. You can detail the structure of your files, the steps taken, and add some visualisations.", "State your business case: Before going on about what you have done, giving some context would be highly beneficial to anyone reading. This part makes the results look more impressive as you can tell in a story \u201cwhat had been\u201d and then the project should show \u201cwhat can be done\u201d and \u201chow\u201d.", "Table of contents with navigation links: A contents table can go a long way, especially if your README had a lot of information in it. Giving the reader a summary of what they can read in the README and the ability to jump to specific parts is a major convenience.", "File descriptions with navigation links: Adding a small description for each file can also greatly help the reader understand what each component of the repository does or contains. Again, add links to simplify navigation.", "Use drop downs: Markdowns have the ability to use drop downs, and this can help shrink the length of your README when someone wants to go through it. You can choose to have some sections already hidden and with option to show the section and vice versa.", "Executive summary: This is the bulk of the README where you can go over the steps of your project with concise descriptions for what you did and what you found out at each stage, accompanied with visualisations (in image format). Make sure the descriptions don\u2019t go too technical as the README is the perfect place for non-technical people to see your project, and you don\u2019t want them to read about the specifics of code used in a function.", "Future improvements: After the results, end with a part dedicated to future work/improvements to do with this project, and/or what else you may plan to do in the future in regard to the topic of the project or data science.", "I hope this helps you with creating a good data science project repository on Github. Please comment with any other tips and techniques you feel like would be useful for creating a good repository.", "Your home for data science.
