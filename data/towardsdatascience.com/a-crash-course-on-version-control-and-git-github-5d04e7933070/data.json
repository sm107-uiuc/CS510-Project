Notes on the series can also be found here.", "If you\u2019re a beginner in computer science or you\u2019re a budding programmer who just started learning the basics and foundation of programming, whether you\u2019re learning C, Swift, Python, or JavaScript, you\u2019re sure to come across version control in one of your online courses or YouTube video tutorials. The words Git and GitHub might seem new and strange to you at the start, but soon as you progress into writing code and sharing it online, you\u2019ll be using it on a day-to-day basis. Here\u2019s a quick intro to version control and Git, plus resources to learn them.", "Git and GitHub is the de facto version control tool every programmer, data scientist, machine learning engineer, web developer, full-stack developer, etc. uses.", "Git is basically a really powerful source control system, due to its speed and flexibility. Although you can get through using Git with the bare-bones commands that do the job, it can be quite challenging for beginners,", "Although Git is in the name GitHub, they\u2019re two separate things, as Git existed before GitHub. There are other places you can host your Git repositories but GitHub is the most popular and widely-used site.", "GitHub is thus just a website for you to manage your git repositories, there are tons of other platforms like BitBucket, Digital Ocean, Azure DevOps, But GitHub has beautiful UI and is easy to use.", "To effectively use GitHub and Git together, you have to understand what version control really is, along with mostly used commands to supercharge your workflow and make you a more effective programmer.", "A version control system (VCS) is as intuitive as the name suggests, it\u2019s basically a collection of tools that help you track changes to your source code or files. It maintains the history of changes and facilitates collaboration with other developers.", "You can think of what VCS does as taking snapshots of changes in your code and files, and stores information as messages which explains why the change was made and who made it.", "That said, VCS is incredibly helpful for three main reasons.", "So, a quick rundown of a basic flow of VCS is \u2014 files are hosted in repositories shared online with other coders. You clone your repo to have a local copy to edit it. After making changes, you stage the file and commit it. Then, you push to commit to the shared repo where the new file is online with messages explaining what changed, why, and by whom.", "There are a couple of basic git commands you should know by heart if you\u2019re to be a master programmer one day.", "Here\u2019s a list of commands you\u2019ll use when cloning repos into your local machine.", "If you haven\u2019t connected your machine to your GitHub account, do so before learning Git. Here\u2019s an article by Joseph Robinson on how to do so.", "These commands are the very basic ones, and if you want to check out more of them, refer to this amazing website.", "Most people use a terminal to run these commands, but there are other options for doing VCS, like using GitHub desktop if you prefer clicking and no typing. IDEs also are helpful as they have Git and GitHub features built-in and you can use them seamlessly.", "When you\u2019re just starting out using VCS, you may be confused when to commit your code, or how best to use VCS, so here are some helpful tips.", "Learning Git and mastering it can be very helpful in your journey towards becoming a programmer, data scientists, web developer, etc.", "Writing a program, creating a game, a website, a personal portfolio, a machine learning model, a mobile application, etc, all these will require version control systems that help you manage them effectively, and when you start collaborating with others, you\u2019ll see how fundamental it is.", "GitHub is an amazing website, not only can it serve as your portfolio, there are tons of gems on Github that shares a huge list of resources, which are especially helpful for beginners.", "GitHub collections are a great place to start if you\u2019re looking for cool things.", "If you\u2019re looking for Data Science resources, check out my article.", "Thanks for reading and I hope you learned something.
