A younger version of me, in one of his first jobs out of academia, got fired. Yes, even as an ex-postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University, and college lecturer in Maths and Statistics, I was sent on my way!", "Did they not know who I was?", "It turns out they knew exactly who I was. I was a guy who\u2019d been working for a year on a huge Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis that had yielded precisely no value. And the fact that it was using the latest convergence diagnostics and the most up-to-date methods for dimension reduction meant a sweet fat nothing [1]. Because they also knew who they were \u2014 a small start-up company who couldn\u2019t carry unproductive people.", "Of course the blow to my young man\u2019s ego wasn\u2019t pleasant, but, ho hum, it turned out to be a good thing in the end. We learn more from our mistakes than our successes, right? It\u2019s why all experienced data scientists know so much. And now I\u2019m in management roles I keep seeing other people straight out of academia make the same mistakes that I did. So here are 5 things you should know if you\u2019re coming out of academia and entering data science.", "I get it. To have got on a PhD programme you must have been one of those kids who spent their whole lives excelling academically. You\u2019ll have been in top sets at school, gone to a great university where you\u2019ll have done well. By the time you hit your late 20s, pretty much your whole life will have been a series of people telling you that you\u2019ll do well because you\u2019re smart. So you\u2019ve kept trying to demonstrate that you\u2019re smart, so more people tell you you\u2019re smart and so the cycle has continued.", "Look, the whole school to academia system is truly messed up, but that\u2019s a post for another day. Here you just need to know that no-one cares how smart you are, they just care how useful you are.", "If you truly grok that you can probably stop reading right now, because all the other things follow naturally. However if you\u2019re the sort of person that thinks you grok that, then you should probably keep reading. You sound a bit smart to me \u2026", "2. Being useful is different to writing a paper.", "Now you might say to yourself, \u201cRight, got it, let\u2019s be useful. OK so we use this technique in the company to do that thing, and I read this paper on this slightly different technique. So if I use this different technique on that company thing, then I\u2019m being useful. Because it\u2019s a company thing.\u201d And then you go tell your manager that you\u2019re going to do this and they look at you like they want to throttle you. And that makes you feel bad.", "This way of behaving seems familiar because it\u2019s what academics are trained to do. Taking a technique from one field and applying it to your own is an easy way of getting a publication. Frankly, in academia, it doesn\u2019t even have to work any better than the existing techniques. It just has to be novel.", "Your manager couldn\u2019t care less about novel. You\u2019ve just told them that you\u2019re going to spend an unknown period of time experimenting with an unproven technique that may or may not improve on a solution that is working satisfactorily already. And you\u2019re wondering why they\u2019re not enthusiastic?", "There\u2019s a variation on this, whereby the data scientist hunts around the company trying to find a problem that is just about easy enough to solve, but only with a pleasant amount of deep thinking. In some cases the data scientist might end up doing something marginally OK, but rarely will it be that useful. This is because the motivation for doing the thing isn\u2019t really to be useful at all. It\u2019s the deep thinking that\u2019s the true motivator. Again this is the sort of behaviour that gets rewarded in academia. There showing that you\u2019re smart by solving difficult problems is the whole point. Your manager doesn\u2019t care.", "3. Working out how to be useful is part of the job.", "OK so you\u2019ve broken those academic habits, but you find yourself adrift. If these people don\u2019t want you to behave as you\u2019ve been trained, then what on earth do they want?", "Well firstly, relax. Part of your paycheck is for figuring out what\u2019s useful and what isn\u2019t. The difficulty is that no two environments are the same so whatever my advice, you\u2019re going to have to figure some stuff out for yourself. However here are three archetypes for you to think about.", "Firstly there\u2019s the chaotic product environment. In this environment you\u2019ll have a lot of product people running around saying \u201cwe want to do this thing asap, but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible\u201d. Now this might sound like a difficult place to be, but as far as doing something useful goes, it\u2019s actually the easiest! Just find a product person who seems sane, buddy up with them, and work on what they want. They should be experts in their product, have an understanding of what the potential market for it is, and so really know what will be useful and what won\u2019t. In other words you\u2019ve just outsourced the \u201cworking out how to be useful\u201d part of your job to someone else. All you have to do now is build that useful thing. And you\u2019re great at that, right?", "Secondly there\u2019s the \u201cimprove the number\u201d type environment. You often find these in companies with well established data science teams. In this case you or your team will own a service that takes in data, does some Maths and outputs something, often a prediction. There will be a number measuring the quality of that something and you have to improve that number.", "Now it sounds like \u201cworking out how to be useful\u201d has been done! Improve the number, stupid! Unfortunately, it\u2019s not so simple. You have to figure out the thing that improves the number the most in as short a space of time as possible. The temptation to an ex-academic is to drop back to the old way of behaving and apply some novel technique you read about. Then after months of effort you realise the new method has hardly shifted the number at all. The right thing to do here is to analyse actual failure cases and have a hard and honest think about what will fix the largest number of them. (My prediction: improving the data will by and large trump a more complex method.) The point is, you have to have a real think about what will actually improve the number, and that might involve work that\u2019s stupid and boring. Don\u2019t just reach for a smart new shiny thing and hope for the best.", "Finally, there\u2019s the dysfunctional environment. You\u2019ll recognise these because no-one really knows why they are there or what they are supposed to be doing. There are many reasons for this. Perhaps someone at the company knew they needed data science but didn\u2019t have a clue why. Perhaps the person who had a clue left, and there\u2019s now a dangling team with no home. Occasionally it\u2019s a research team kept around long past the time when their research had any relevance to the company mission. If you\u2019re in this situation you\u2019re in trouble. The best you can do to make it work is to try and turn it into the first kind of environment by reaching out to product people outside your immediate team. However in some cases, you might want to dust off that linkedin profile.", "You shouldn\u2019t try to be useful alone. In academia, especially as a postdoc, you are a one man band, expected to be mathematician, writer, graphic designer, programmer, public speaker \u2026 the list goes on. Additionally you are in fierce competition with the people around you for a very small number of jobs in a very rigid hierarchy that might have made sense to a late 19th century Prussian. This all makes for a strange and isolating working environment, in which people develop overweening egos to survive. Making it worse, is a cultural assumption within academia that smart people stay on to do A-levels at school, the smartest of those go to undergrad, the smartest of those do postgrad, the smartest of those stay on for a postdoc and so on and so on.", "You need to drop all that. Firstly if I think back to my time on the undergraduate / postgraduate transition, it definitely isn\u2019t true that the smartest people stayed on to do PhDs. That means that they\u2019re out there in the workplace and don\u2019t need any #iamverysmart nonsense from you. More positively, it also means that they can help you with all that stuff which, if you\u2019re honest, you know you\u2019re not very good at. In fact, one of the great pleasures of working life is being in a cohesive well functioning team where each person takes on the roles that they enjoy.", "So don\u2019t be that guy tediously lecturing his colleagues on their jobs. Instead take it as an opportunity to work with, and learn from, other great people who think a little bit differently from you.", "5. A small amount of paranoia is healthy in the workplace.", "It\u2019s 2020, and though capitalism has built many wonders, it is a ruthless beast. This \u201cbeing useful\u201d stuff rests on an unemotional calculus of known present costs vs estimated future benefits. And you are a known present cost. As soon as your costs outweigh your estimated future benefits you are in trouble.", "So, unfortunately, you need to worry a bit about what expected future benefit the company gets from you. Not so much that you\u2019re sleepless and paralysed by fear, of course. But just enough to keep you focused. You\u2019re not in academia where either people have tenure and rarely get fired, or are on fixed term contracts and never get fired.", "Now this is a description of how things are, not a judgement call on how they ought to be. Suffice to say, if you think (or, worse, your manager is telling you) that everything\u2019s fine and everyone can pootle along, clocking off at 5.00pm, then your team is in trouble. The kind of trouble that involves M.B.A.s with great skin, suspiciously neat haircuts, and spreadsheets that lay out the case for major budget cuts.", "So that\u2019s it. 5 things I wish I\u2019d known as someone leaving academia and entering the workplace. If you can think of any more, or disagree wildly, please chime in down in the comments!", "[1] Oh yes, kids of today, it turns out that deep neural nets are not the first technique to come along, generate a lot of excitement by promising to approximate any function in the world, but then prove not to be a universal panacea. Of course I realise I\u2019m giving away my age here.", "Your home for data science.
