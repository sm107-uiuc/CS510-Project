Since Microsoft made Azure Data Studio generally available in September 2018 and investing heavily in this tool improvement in the meantime, it looks like good old SQL Server Management Studio is destined to go into (well-deserved) retirement\u2026", "As a SQL Developer, who is writing queries on a day-to-day basis, I will try to give some observations based on what I discovered so far, with special emphasis on Azure Data Studio, since I believe that most of us are more than familiar with SSMS already.", "Short intro before I dive deeper into some cool features of the \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d. When I heard the name of the new tool, I wasn\u2019t planning to test it deeply, because the \u201cAzure\u201d part didn\u2019t wake special interest in me. However, after I heard Ben Weissman speaking at SQL Saturday Vienna this January when he explained that \u201cAzure\u201d word doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you need to use this tool in conjunction with Azure palette of products, I decided to give it a try.", "So, my first impression is: Microsoft named this IDE quite misleading! Why calling it \u201cAzure Data Studio\u201c, when connecting to Azure is just one of the options? You can also connect to the on-prem SQL Server database, as previously with SSMS, but you can also connect to Big Data Clusters (the latest feature of SQL Server, introduced in 2019 edition).", "The main advantage of Azure Data Studio is its portability \u2014 while SSMS can work only on the Windows platform, ADS can run on Linux and macOS as well. That\u2019s a huge step forward and going in line with Microsoft\u2019s general expansion to non-Windows world.", "Another huge difference to SSMS is that you can use notebooks, and writing SQL, Python, Spark, or Scala scripts within them. I can\u2019t elaborate more on this since I\u2019m still not using this feature (I\u2019m a traditional SQL guy), but it definitely gives more flexibility for more sophisticated usage, comparing to SSMS.", "Ok, enough with generic descriptions of the features and differences between ADS and SSMS. I will try to bold some neat features that Azure Data Studio offers:", "When I write queries, I often need to check database object definitions. For example, to see if the underlying data type is DATETIME or DATETIME2. Of course, that can be achieved in SSMS using some 3rd party add-ons (by the way, I like SSMS Boost), but it\u2019s quite straightforward in ADS:", "Simply mark the object you want to check, right-click, and under Peek, select Peek Definition. You will immediately see the definition of the selected object:", "As far as I know, SSMS still lacks dark mode, and I know a lot of developers are craving this. In ADS, dark mode is there!", "Go to File->Preferences->Color Theme and choose the layout you want:", "This can be really useful and I\u2019m using it extensively when working with Azure Data Studio. It can give you a brief overview of data returned by your query, so you can perform quick data profiling straight away and check how many NULLs are there, if there are some outliers, etc.", "After I ran this query, I can choose a chart icon on the right and visualize my results immediately:", "Moreover, as you can notice in the picture above, I can define the whole set of parameters and adjust the visual appearance of the results.", "Azure Data Studio comes with a Git source control manager (SCM), so source control becomes one of the greatest advantages comparing to SSMS! More details on how to perform source control of your code can be found in official Azure Data Studio documentation.", "In many cases, you need to provide your users with quick results of the queries. Now, no need to copy/paste query results or using some external add-ons for processing these simple requests. With literally one click, you are good to go!", "On the right side, you simply choose if you want to export your results as CSV, Excel, JSON, XML or to visualize them (as in the previous tip).", "This one could easily take first place, but I intentionally left it for the end. Imagine that you can have all relevant measures in one place, such as the number of currently running queries, deadlocks, index fragmentation, etc.!", "I will demonstrate how you can create a dashboard for index fragmentation check, but you can easily expand your dashboard with queries you may find relevant for your monitoring.", "Once I execute this query, I select Chart icon on the right:", "I will save this query on Desktop (you can save it in whatever folder you like). Then, I choose the Table chart type and click on Create Insight above the result set:", "Once I do this, the JSON code will be generated. After that, go to View tab, choose Command Palette and then Preference: Open User Settings.", "Search for Dashboard.Database.Widgets and select to Edit in settings.json.", "In \u201cdashboard.database.widgets\u201d key, paste JSON code created in one of the previous steps.", "Save this settings.json file, navigate to StackOverflow2013 database, right-click on it and choose Manage. As you can see, our newly created widget is pinned to a dashboard and we can easily monitor what is going on with our indexes fragmentation.", "You can create multiple different widgets and pin them to a dashboard, so you get a quick overview of key metrics for your database.", "Despite being a truly an awesome tool, Azure Data Studio still lacks some key features in order to be considered as a direct substitute for SSMS. That\u2019s especially true for DBAs tasks, where SSMS as a mature tool offers many more options.", "As far as I see it, both tools are here to stay, at least for some time in the future!", "Microsoft constantly upgrades Azure Data Studio, and I will dedicate separate articles to some recently added features, such as SQL Agent jobs, or more common tasks, such as using estimated and actual query execution plans to tune your queries.", "Honestly, I still use SSMS more frequently than ADS (maybe just because I\u2019m more accustomed to it), but I believe that every developer should give at least a try to an Azure Data Studio.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
