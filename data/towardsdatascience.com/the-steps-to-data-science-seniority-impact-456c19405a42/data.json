To summarize everything, I\u2019ve proposed three pillars that a Data Scientist should look to improve in order to reach seniority:", "In this story, we will talk about a part of the second (and arguably, most important) pillar: impact, and ways of increasing it. But first, have a gander at this great article about everything Data Science: it touches on most of the points I made in this article and more.", "If you came from a Master's Degree or a Ph.D., you most certainly experienced a rather nonchalant desire to reach for the state-of-the-art. To ever increase the F-score in a SemEval task or the mAP in PASCAL-VOC or COCO: publish a paper with a better model architecture without changing your dataset!", "If you don't have origins in academia, maybe you had Kaggle as a part-time hobby. Each competition begets a similar feeling of pushing borders, advancing with each successful submission.", "A Data Scientist will often be overwhelmed by new technologies and the desire to use them. We refer to algorithms and libraries as part of our toolset: new, shiny tools often distract us more than the tried-and-true MultinomialNBs. It is not unlike the pursuit of new tech in front-end developers\u2026 We jest that a JavaScript framework is born every day, but the same can be said of neural network architectures and algorithms.", "Because of that, you will waste time on a dreamy recurrent/convolutional multilayered neural network when a Na\u00efve Bayes solution will deliver the same effective results. You will overanalyze an incomplete dataset with ever-increasing complexity just to see what you want to see.", "When you have a hammer, nails are all you see. And neural networks are often sledgehammers.", "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything. \u2015 Ronald H. Coase, Essays on Economics and Economists", "So, the first thing you need to do is to let go. Liberate yourself from the constraint of strict comparison and embrace the small victories. Don't treat everything as a Kaggle, striving for first place in lieu of everything else. Don't hammer your data with only the strongest tools in your toolset just to prove a point.", "Is that extra percentage point worth a week of training and three times the processing power? Sure, it'll look good on a paper. But is it worth forcing your infrastructure and team resources just for that? Will it be noticeable in the final product?", "I'm not telling you to throw all metrics away, though! They are absolutely essential to analyze and quantify your methods and measure the extent of your improvements to a system. Unfortunately, if you only look for those in your work, you lose valuable information for both your personal development and your company's bottom line.", "Below, you'll find two articles about the jump to Data Science and about the academic trap, a term that I just fell in love with.", "There is a sweet release when you factor impact over metrics, simplicity over complexity. Are you listening to that sweet lullaby up there? If not, scroll up and hit play, listen to it and come back here. It\u2019s part of the process.", "That impetus to reach the state-of-the-art is a blinder we self-impose that keeps us creating better academic papers over time. When we let go of that, we must learn to look into the present with fresh eyes, looking behind the graphs.", "Let's work on this concept through three examples.", "Let's say you have a simple model that classifies products in categories using their textual descriptions. Your common metrics say it is worse than random choice in an overall manner. Usually, you'd throw it to the wolves and move on with experiments, but this time you decide to take a closer look\u2026 and you find that it is 100% accurate in specific classes.", "So, you change your approach: you do a hierarchical classifier with the best classes as leaf nodes and the others are shuffled to a second classifier. Rinse, repeat, and you now have a classification scheme that has the complexity to deal with your problem and the simplicity of a na\u00efve model. We develop in an Agile world: reuse is not limited to generic code.", "Your model is compressing everything in the geek domain into a single class. Does it have \u201cStar Wars\u201d in the title? The model says it's a wrench. \u201cThe Return of the King: Theatrical Version\u201d? Another wrench. Maybe he has some kind of nostalgia for sonic screwdrivers.", "Your model ended up doing style clustering, something valuable on its own. That would evade even the most basic of metrics involved in classification, something that you can only perceive with manual data exploration. Sometimes, it's better to waste some time shaving bytes and knowing your domain instead of focusing solely on the metric acquisition process.", "Let's go a little further and assume that your model really does nothing of value whatsoever. Before moving on, look for every improvement you made in your treatment of that data and add the best ones to your cookbook. New ways of training data, new libraries you scrambled to find, better ways to manage your project.", "Look even further beyond for possible uses of Data tech in other fields of your company. Maybe the Marketing team will be interested in a Word Sense Disambiguator for keyword discovery. The DBA could be interested in a sharding technique for big tables. Your word embedding might be useful in deduplication tasks in Compliance. Plan for modularization and aim for multidisciplinarity in your projects.", "Well, when you look too much into the present, you might be inclined to stick with it. Everything can be useful, so why shouldn't we stay in this model forever? There are infinite possibilities, maybe a small tweak in this hyperparameter calculation could increase our accuracy by a few decimals\u2026", "And then you are getting fooled again! It's the reverse blinder, showing you infinite possibilities in the fields around your model. You must be in a healthy relationship with both the present results and the future prospects to move on when needed. Allocate a deadline in your mind and try to follow it: with experience, it gets easier to correctly estimate your exploration.", "To help you with that exploration, you can count on metrics to guide what you are doing right. But didn\u2019t I just tell you that metrics are evil? Like everything in life, moderation is key. They are guidelines to lead you to better results and stop signs to warn you of fruitless pursuits: use them to better gauge your time in the exploration of each model.", "The following articles are about generic model exploration and choices.", "In the end, you need to solve a problem in your company, and not just create interesting models. Learning to balance raw computing power and crafty solutions is part of dealing with the problem\u2026", "But at the end of the day, you are not just making a top-of-the-line ML model or a pretty dashboard: you are solving a problem. To go from the how to the why is a jump that demands a little more than just technical experience.", "The Data Scientist is a beast that can take many forms depending on their domain of choice. Invariably, they accumulate enough Data on the company to give valuable advice on how to direct certain product management scopes: what insights should you be displaying in your dashboard, what departments to connect with data-centric culture, etc.", "This is a tad different from other seniority levels in programming, as Data Science offers a straight bridge into Business Intelligence and an opportunity to delve into Data Product Management. It is easier to look at the big picture when you are in direct communication with clients/managers over what type of value Data can aggregate to a product.", "So, the first step is to use that bridge to get involved with your final product. To learn what your objective is and build a better solution, you need to understand the endgame: who will use it, where will it be deployed, how it will be used\u2026 To understand your role in a Task, you must know where it fits in your User Story, in your Epic.", "You must first be involved internally, engaging with your Project Owner/Manager and extracting information from them as needed. Build healthy relationships with your managers, sharing new ideas that bubbled out of your team, and actively interacting with your solution architecture planning.", "Now, some may insist that dealing with client requirements is part of the Product Manager role. As we discussed previously if he is not versed in Data Science he will not be properly equipped to fend off uncertain (or impossible) requisite requests; therefore, it is up to the Data Science team to get involved with these transactions in order to guarantee the success of the project.", "The following article is a great explanation of this Product/Data interplay.", "There is a small problem in all this reasoning\u2026 If you are inside a company that has just created their Data Science sector, chances are you will be stonewalled inside your department. You'll need to build Data Culture from the inside to facilitate internal/external information access. In the article below, you'll find that steps 3 and 4 are exactly about fixing this issue of information starvation.", "This is the basest soft skill in the Data Scientist toolkit: the patience to extract requirements, absorb business intelligence, and sell hot insights.", "If you liked this story, check out the other articles in this series:", "I\u2019m partial to the thought that a Data Scientist is a good learner and not necessarily a know-er. Don\u2019t be desperate to delve into every area and be a master in it. Slowly but surely we will accumulate knowledge and experience dealing with Data on a daily basis. We are all walking up in the steps of Data together!", "Thank you for reading, and have fun in this Data-filled universe!", "Your home for data science.
