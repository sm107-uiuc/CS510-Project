In this project, we will build a Python script to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on stock prices regarding the Milan & Paris Stock Exchanges. We will explore the performance of some of the biggest fashion companies on the market to see how good or bad they have stood against the COVID-19 storm. We will take as reference stock prices before the outbreak in Italy and compare it to the same stock prices a few weeks later until April 21st. We will be doing this by conducting different analysis and by computing daily price changes for multiple stocks. After, we will try to explore the relationship between the stock prices and the daily new numbers of coronavirus cases in Italy.", "Note: To review the code and get your hands on the dataset, please visit my profile on GitHub, and if you are interested in exploring more projects, check my first project about Machine Learning, and the second project about the Real Estate Market COVID-19 disruption.", "Let\u2019s get started and have a look on our dataset. We choose to investigate the Adj. close prices.", "Adjusted closing price accurately reflect that stock\u2019s value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is considered to be the true price of that stock and is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns.", "Notice that some days might be missing like the first day of the year as yahoo finance sometimes faces network problems.", "In the above representation, stocks can be classified into two groups: Reliable stocks and Volatile stocks. Reliable stocks are the ones that didn\u2019t show much difference between the minimum adj. close price and the maximum adj. close price in the time period specified. e.g.: Kering, LVMH, Christian Dior and Moncler. However, Volatile stocks are the ones that varied the most between the minimum and maximum adj. closing price of stocks. e.g.: Aeffe", "It is now clear that most of the stocks pre COVID-19 period saw a change in volatility in their closing prices once the COVID-19 storm hit.", "Now let\u2019s explore the Minimum and Maximum returns dates.", "It is interesting to note that most of these stocks had their lowest return in 12th March 2020. In that date the USA declared a national emergency, while Italy had the highest number of deaths per day in the world (including China at its peak) for each of the previous four days.", "All the companies had their highest returns in March as well. It\u2019s interesting also to notice that in the day of March 24th Trump announced that USA Will Be \u201cOpen for Business Very Soon\u201d.", "Now, we will try to divide the returns to two datasets, before and after COVID-19, then we will apply the standard deviation on the stock returns.", "In the next graphs, if the stocks occur at the right end of the chart, they are considered volatile with significant values of standard deviation while if they occur on the left they should be considered reliable.", "It is clear that Christian Dior (CDI) has suffered the most, shifting from the most reliable stock to the most volatile stock due to the pandemic. However, Brunello Cucinelli (BC) has made the most progress during this period, shifting the other way around, more positive moves happened also to Moncler, Kering while LVMH has stayed the same.", "To elaborate more on the impact of the COVID-19 on each of the stock prices, we will divide each of the stock daily prices by the row of reference, in our example, that is the 21st of February(notice the first row). That will give us a more clear idea on the performance of each of them.", "We can easily see the impact of COVID-19 on stock prices in percentage terms. For instance, we see that a company like Aeffe had an adj. close price on 13th of March that was trading at 44% discount compared to the 21st of February.", "Similarly, Brunello Cucinelli was trading at 19% discount while Moncler at 21% was performing better than LVMH and Kering groups.", "Now we have a proof supported with data that COVID-19 had a huge impact on stock prices. But what about the period before? That is when the virus first started in Wuhan, China until it arrived to Italy?", "Let\u2019s recreate the same analysis from 30th of December to the 21st of February.", "Except for Aeffe, it seems that for the majority of the stocks, the outbreak of the virus had minimum impact on stock prices when there were almost no cases in Europe while thousands were in China. It\u2019s also noticeable the huge growth achieved by Brunello Cucinelli that might be connected to the fact that on the 7th of January they released preliminary figures for the year before with an increase in net revenues of 9.9%, which made the company\u2019s shares climbed 7.6% on the Italian Stock Exchange.", "However, COVID-19 stopped that growth for Brunello Cucinelli, as they have recently reported a decrease in revenues on their first quarter.", "Now let\u2019s visualize the whole period altogether.", "It\u2019s amazing to notice the performance of the stock price of Moncler, impressive performance in facing the storm of COVID-19.", "Now it\u2019s time to include the COVID-19 data into our analysis. We will add data related to daily new infected cases in Italy for the time period of 24th Feb until 21st Apr (since there was no data about the daily numbers on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd).", "We can see clearly see the trend, in most of the cases, the number of COVID-19 cases increases the stock price decrease.", "And finally, we can represent the correlation with a heat map.", "In this heat map if we checked the last row we can see that with some companies like Christian Dior and Brunello Cucinelli the relationship is strong > 70%, means that when the daily number of infected cases increase those stock prices decrease.", "The stock market has drifted hard due to COVID-19, The impact is increased by the fact that many companies have limited visibility into their risk exposure or supply chain, and for that reason, hard times can be a reflection of your own strength, companies today understand they have a responsibility to their customers, employees, and stakeholders to be successful in both financial and social terms.", "Many brands have responded with bold approaches to give stakeholders a reason to believe that they will get through this crisis and move forward together. Regardless of the big drop that happened on March 13th to most of the stock prices, the data from Moncler stock price has shown a great performance so far, which indicate business and brand resilience and flexibility, followed by the giants LVMH and Kering Groups.", "\u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d: \u201cYour company\u2019s strategy must articulate a path to achieve financial performance. To sustain that performance, however, you must also understand the societal impact of your business as well as the ways that broad, structural trends \u2014 from slow wage growth to rising automation to climate change \u2014 affect your potential for growth.\u201d \u2014 Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, in his 2018 annual letter to CEOs", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
