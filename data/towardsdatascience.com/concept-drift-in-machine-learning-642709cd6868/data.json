The change in data leads to degrading testing performance of the machine learning model with time. Ultimately the wrong prediction coming out of the model can affect its business values.", "The relationship between input and output label attributes doesn\u2019t remain static rather it changes with time, which affects the model performance as it is unable to understand the new underlying pattern present in the new data. The effect is termed as Concept Drift in machine learning.", "In this article, I will provide a brief overview of this concept that is used in machine learning quite frequently and is important for every practitioner to be aware of.", "Here\u2019s a brief mention of the points I will be going through the this article.", "Concept drift is an effect which leads to degradation of the machine learning model\u2019s performance over the years. This degradation happens due to the change in the underlying pattern between the new data set on which model is tested and the data set on which model is trained. This change happens due to change is customer\u2019 s product buying pattern or due to some weather parameter getting changed over time.", "We all would be quite familiar with this basic function concept:", "Here we have a function f which understands the pattern or relationship between independent variable X and dependent variable Y.", "But when this pattern fades, the model gives out the wrong output and becomes equivalent to garbage.", "This is where concept drift comes into effect.", "We all are aware that the data science project is executed in various phases, right? Starting with:", "I am taking that we all are quite familiar with the top 6 concepts. Concept drift comes in the last phase i.e., model retraining and updating. It is where the model is deployed on the customer end and frequent model testing happens daily. To avoid the model\u2019s deviation, its prediction is monitored and checked as if it is giving the right predictions or not to maintain business productivity.", "We need to monitor this effect because it can cause a huge problem for the business entity it is running for. Wrong predictions can lead to a business company losing its reputation as well as its loyal customers as a model could be providing wrong recommendations that aren\u2019t matching with the new buying pattern of the users.", "Let\u2019s take an example of Corona pandemic time where people have experienced a major shift in their buying patterns. They are only catering their requirements to very necessary stuff, of which the model is unaware. Thus it keeps recommending products to them which aren\u2019t going with the customer\u2019s choice. Due to this, a business can lose a major chunk of revenue.", "There are many methods to deal with this issue.", "1.Do Nothing (Maintain a single static model).", "NO, I am not joking...!. We can just assume that the underlying pattern in the data doesn\u2019t change over time which in many cases happens so.", "Due to this, we can focus on building one single best model for making future predictions and focus on some other projects.", "This may be a bit more effective than the first one. We retrain our outdated model on the new data set coming in, thus explaining the new underlying pattern in the data set.", "This saves the model from becoming \u2018Garbage\u2019 and keeps bringing business values.", "Instead of updating the outdated model on the new data set we can train and deploy a new model time by time when our testing shows that the previous model giving wrong predictions.", "This method is a bit more effective as a change in the model can make leads to more accurate predictions. But model training, as well as its deployment, takes significant time.", "4.Ensemble a new model with the old one.", "In this method, we ensemble some new models trained on the new data set with the outdated model. It is where the new model work together with the old one at the same time correcting the wrong predictions of the old model.", "This method comes out to be a bit complex but more effective than the above mentioned.", "[Edit] If you want to dive deep into the topic, please go through this article at neptune.ai.", "All right guys, that\u2019s it for today. I think we must have learned some new concepts. This effect is most of the time ignored by the junior data scientists who after completing one project thinks their work is over, but that\u2019s not the case. Their responsibilities don\u2019t end there. To maintain our business values we must monitor and track how and what values we are adding to customer\u2019s experience and whether the recommendation provider is providing them with good recommendations or not.", "For more as such visit here.", "If this article has benefitted you in anyway.
