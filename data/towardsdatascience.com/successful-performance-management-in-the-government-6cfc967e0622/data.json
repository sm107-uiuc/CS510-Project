While early proponents\u2019 focus has been on the potential benefits of performance management and the use of performance information for policy measurement, recent work has called into question the efficacy of policy-based systems. However, there are significant benefits being realized through sub-agency adoption and implementation.", "The stated hope of performance information is to monitor the effectiveness of policies and programs. For example, can we measure the success of prison reform legislation, welfare to work programs, or healthcare reform on a system-wide basis?", "Unfortunately, studies show that performance management has not yet worked well on a system-level in the United States. This is mainly due to the fact that while congress and state legislatures often require these metrics and data, they are often not used in program reviews or budget processes based on political realities.", "However, research is pointing to the successful use of performance information in federal agency decision-making, most commonly at the office or bureau level. At this level, the information being produced is more closely tied to the aims of the office and the feedback loops are tighter, arguably leading to more effective adoption.", "Performance management can be thought about in terms of measuring the input and outputs of particular processes. In the public sector, this takes on the additional definition of performance information associated with outputs and outcomes of the intended policy; measuring whether they are in line with the ultimate policy goals to provide an assessment of effectiveness in most cases, but also efficiencies.", "In the public sector, it\u2019s also important to focus on the achievements and results, rather than just the financial aspects. So while the private sector may focus on business intelligence and performance information focused on profit and market share, public sector programs typically focus out outcomes in line with goals and efficiencies.", "Another important characteristic of performance information is that it is quantitative and made transparent through reports, databases, and contains objective standards in line with publicly stated goals. This is where a data science team spends their time compiling input/output data, and creating useful reports and dashboards for internal and external stakeholders.", "The collection of what we define as performance information is intentional, following a designed system of information creation, collection, analysis, and reporting. This is significant in that it is different than simple collection and analysis of data, which is ad-hoc and not purposefully designed to measure a program based on a logic model or intended causal connection.", "Performance management has its roots in the private sector and was adopted from the early scientific management movements. Scientific management believes that you can measure everything; from inputs, processes, procedures, and outputs.", "By measuring everything and applying analyses to find inefficient parts of processes and identify new procedures, companies could maximize profits by better utilizing their resources and eliminating waste.", "The public sector\u2019s adoption of performance management often came from management consultants, appointed leadership who had private sector experience and preferences, and politicians looking to bring private sector \u201cefficiency\u201d to the public sector.", "At its fundamental level, the movement promises efficiency, effectiveness, and transparent oversight. These have long been staples of what politicians and citizens have demanded from the federal government.", "From a political perspectives, the performance management movement is a way to justify the expense of tax dollars collected from citizens. In other instances, it has been a mechanism to identify and ensure effective delivery of programs or implementation of policies which are important to them politically or for their policy agendas.", "Federal agencies in the U.S. were required by congress to implement performance management techniques by the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) in 1993. GPRA required agencies to set goals publicly through five-year strategic plans, measure their progress annually against those goals, and submit public reports on their progress annually determining their success or failure meeting their goals.", "Following GPRA, and in response to several areas of concern and criticism, federal agencies were also required to comply with the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). PART required agencies to answer assessment questions about their programs for purposes of budget justifications.", "Most recently, Congress passed the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRMA) in 2010, which aimed to correct missteps and failings of the GPRA as well as reestablish congressional control over performance management guidance from the executive branch as was seen to be partisan under PART. Specifically, the GPRAMA requires agencies to publish their reports and strategic plans online in machine readable formats. It also created an emphasis on smaller amounts of higher-level goals setting, as well as identifying specific inter-agency priority goals. The intent behind this was to limit focus, energy, and attention on fewer goals to allow agency leadership to sustain focus and be more successful in making program improvements.", "Now that the government is creating performance information, how often and well is it used in policy and program decision-making?", "In highly political policy areas, values, negotiations, and persuasion often crowd out the use of expertise and data to guide decisions or problem discussions. When politics is driving policy decisions, there must be a result of conflicts, trade-offs, and compromises which inherently will likely not align with objective data and evidence-based recommendations.", "It is important to note that this can, and should, be expected from a representative democracy structure such as the United States government. In fact, several have pointed out that the objective and simple data-driven goals of performance management movement are somewhat incompatible with a political systems which demands representation by elected officials.", "One of the most important findings in successful use of performance management use in decision-making is that managers are one of the most significant factors. However, not always in the ways you might expect.", "Researchers have identified certain traits of managers that can encourage the use of performance information in organizational decision-making. These factors are the manager\u2019s self-efficacy, receptivity to feedback, sensitivity to the external environment, and how much they value employee input. The idea behind these finding is that a manager\u2019s personality can positively influence performance information use in the organization by \u201csetting the table\u201d by modeling an inquisitive nature.", "Other research found that the relationship between performance information use and organization performance is important. These findings show support for the idea that for performance management to be successfully used, it must be tied to a new vision, better outcomes for stakeholders, or a significant change in the organization.", "Organization strategy matters too. You are more likely to experience successful implementation and use of performance information when it is associated with stretch-goals or innovations. The systems will be less effective if used to monitor existing work and goals. So managers should not just layer it onto existing processes and products but instead tie the adoption to new initiatives and rally the organization behind them.", "Organizational culture, flexibility, and professionalism have also been found to be positively associated with performance information use. Additionally, the presence of public service motivation at the individual manager level and the organizational culture level were good predictors for performance information use.", "It is no surprise that training influences the successful adoption and implementation of performance measurement in the federal government.", "This is important because each successive performance management doctrine has identified training as a necessary component. In fact, the GPRAMA specifically requires the government to identify and implement requisite training for agency staff.", "While a large portion of training is aimed at educating employees about the performance management requirements and systems, capacity training would help agency staff successful implement and use performance information by giving them knowledge and skills needed rather than just informing them of the requirements. Capacity training should include curriculum that would cover how to measure performance, how to use discretion, how to learn from performance data, and how to use performance data for accountability purposes.", "Performance management is likely here to stay in the public sector in one form or another. Unless there are significant changes to the United States representative democracy structure, it is unlikely that we will see performance information used to objectively determine which policies and programs to adopt. Instead, it is likely that those will remain value-based decisions informed by voters and stakeholders.", "I don\u2019t believe this is a failing of the performance-based movement, rather an acknowledgement of our system which relies on voter input. What is promising is the extent to which performance management has been adopted and implemented at the sub-agency level.", "Additionally, the increased successes of the use of performance information to inform strategic planning, making program and procedural changes, and to provide insight and feedback to leadership is impressive.", "Additionally, there is promising work looking at how leadership can combine performance information, with the ideals of evidence-based policy and program evaluations to not only monitor and inform leadership, but also to explore assumptions about causal linkages of outputs and outcomes. This can better identify what should be measured by performance information to ensure that the reported metrics are the correct metrics.", "Even if this information is not direct inserted into political decisions, it still will ensure there is greater efficacy and efficiency in our policy programs where those are goals.", "Additionally, it does provide better information and transparency for interest groups, researchers, and oversight organizations which can in turn be reported out to political leadership and voters when they want it.", "Your home for data science.
