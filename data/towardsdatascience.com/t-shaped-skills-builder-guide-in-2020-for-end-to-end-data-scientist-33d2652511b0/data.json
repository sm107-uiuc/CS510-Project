For his generation, being an expert in one particular area would guarantee a successful career. A couple of decades ago, when we were still living in the information era and the internet was not quite popular as it is today, information was something precious and people were trying to collect pieces of knowledge one-by-one within the very limited resources. Back then, only when they were frequently exposed to the jobs, did they gain more information as well as experience since they barely found additional sources of information which they could quickly learn from. These experts thus became a valuable asset to the company and no one could replace their roles. Being specialised in one thing was their unique values and hence it helped secure their job as well as ensure a thriving career. It would be very hard to find a Java developer twenty years ago when universities were still teaching Pascal or C in their bachelor programs and Coursera, Udemy or YouTube had not even been founded. These developers often got paid extremely high salaries and they built what we call conventional systems these days. Whenever I touch these systems, I really respect the makers.", "Nowadays, when information can be found everywhere and no longer a mystery, companies are less depended on employees with highly specialised skills. Instead, the industry demands more people with the ability to summarise, analyse and decide based on these large amounts of information. We are now living in the conceptual age when we have not only more data than ever but also more complex problems requiring a combination of skillsets and multi-disciplines to provide complete end-to-end solutions. This trend is currently being adopted quickly across all industries including Data Science and this is the reason why companies now need more unicorns or T-Shaped Data Scientists to solve their intricate business problems. In other words, Data Scientists ought to have a diverse skillset on the horizontal bar of the T (the width) while being expert in a specific field on the vertical bar (the depth).", "Based on my very limited experience as a Data Scientist, I would like to share a basic builder guide for those who want to become a T-Shaped person in the Data Science field.", "Being an expert at one thing does not necessarily mean you have to know one specific field in deep and in fact, you should not go too deep. Time is a finite resource and everybody have the same 24 hours per day. When concentrating too much on learning one skill, you won\u2019t have enough time to explore various skillsets being demanded by the industry. What you can do is to build a core-knowledge and develop other skills on top of that.", "As a data scientist, you should know the basics about Statistics and Math (Algebra is a must and maybe a little bit of Calculus). Statistics would provide tools for hypothesis testing and understanding of the data characteristics while Calculus is the vehicle for analysing changes or trends of the data. You won\u2019t be able to understand the Confidence Interval of your prediction and Vanishing Gradient of a Neural Network without any knowledge about Statistics and Calculus respectively.", "On top of Statistics and Math, try to make yourself comfortable with some classes of Machine Learning models such as classification, clustering and regression. They would introduce an overview of different branches of Machine Learning so that you can choose appropriate types of model for your specific business problem. Besides, you can also learn about some advanced ML models such as Random Forest and XGBoost because these are interpretable models, highly accurate and widely used in most common problems employing ML.", "Deep Learning would be a plus. However, since there is no disruptive exploration about Neural Network architectures recently and use-cases for each network structure have been well established for years, you should think of yourself as an AI practitioner experienced in applying these models to solve real business problems. Additionally, information about AI and its applications are now ubiquitous on the internet so that you can quickly find the model to use. Some are even provided with codes and instruction for fine-tuning assuming you have already had basic knowledge about it. The problem here is that you won\u2019t have enough time to master all of these sectors when sitting in the university. Therefore, you will need the second crucial skill set of the core: Researching.", "Most of data scientist teams are formed with the business demands and oriented toward solving business problems. They have to deliver a very specific solution for each type of problem and therefore the team must have people with diverse skills to tackle any tasks assigned by the company. However, they usually don\u2019t know business problems and thus the skills to learn beforehand. In other words, it has to be learnt on the flight. In this situation, research skill becomes extremely important as it would help you learn things quickly and just-enough to solve the problem. For example, if the project requires you to write the code in Typescript due to strict requirements on variable types then you will have to learn Typescript even though you are more confident with Python. Or if the business owner asks you to build a web application to serve your recommendation model to the user, then you will have to learn ReactJS or Angular despite your limited knowledge about front-end development.", "Of course, you won\u2019t be able to become an expert in Typescript or Front-end Development within one or two weeks. You can, however, deliver a complete end-to-end solution that brings business value rather than a highly accurate model but no one can use.", "Learning \u201cHow to learn\u201d is the most difficult subject that no one can teach you. Despite some common practices in popular research methods, the thinking pathway is unique for each individual since they have different abilities, living conditions, educations or even habits could affect their ways of thinking. Therefore, people learn in many different ways and it is your own adventure to find out your best way to learn things. This skill will then help expand your skillset on the horizontal bar of the T and eventually contribute to the success of your career.", "With the core-knowledge built up and you are already enough specialised in Machine Learning and Research Methods, you can then start expanding the skill set to become a generalist. You can think about those skills on the horizontal line of the T as different types of cable used to connect the charger and your devices. The more types of connector you have (micro USB, USB-C or Lightning), the more types of device you can charge. In other words, the more skills you have as a generalist, the more industry sector you can involve in. Below are some basic skills useful for Data Scientists those use data in production.", "While \u201cfail fast, fail often\u201d is the key concept of Agile development in data science, how to recover from failures immediately is what the team need to be able to apply Agile. After all, you don\u2019t want your application fails often and then takes hours to recover after incidents. One of the reasons why Agile is so popular these days even though iterative and incremental development has emerged since early 1957 is that it is now backed by several technologies such as containers, microservices, Kubernetes, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and cloud computing. These technologies make the system more robust and more susceptible to error so that the team can be unleashed from the fear of crashing the entire application. On-premise systems can barely achieve these abilities and it often requires costly complex hardware as well as software configuration. Computing performance is another issue when companies cannot quickly scale their system and share computing resources across the team.", "I once had a chance to work in a data analytics team using an on-premise server and I can confirm that those pain points are real. My first half of the working day was usually spent on running queries against the databases and waiting for the results to come back. Not until I got all data dumped into my workspace, could I start processing and analysing it. Sometimes, my teammates run compute-intensive queries and codes hanging the server for hours. They then had to contact the DBAs to terminate the queries and run it later after work when the server is not busy. How can you rapidly test your hypotheses and iterate through the data science process within this situation? Fortunately, people in the team are smart and they all have tricks to get over the problems one way or another to get the jobs done. However, it really slows them down.", "Cloud environments are the cure for all the issues above as it is highly available and scalable. The environment is also reproducible so that you can re-create it with minimum efforts even when the entire system is down. Besides, containers orchestration solutions will keep checking the health of each server (microservice) and spin up a new one automatically in just a second if one fails. You can test your codes and ideas confidently without worrying about unknown bugs that can crash the application. Cloud compute instances will also scale automatically if you need more computing power.", "Believe it or not, most companies are on the run to find their home on the cloud especially when people are talking about digital transformation everywhere and the current pandemic even increases the pressure on business leaders to transform their company into nearly hundred per cent digital or digital-twin. Therefore, having some experiences with one or two cloud platforms is highly recommended.", "You have an extremely accurate model. Now what? You can\u2019t just use Jupyter Notebook to serve hundreds of users by manually entering unseen observations into the notebook and re-run it. You should, instead, expose your ML model as a service or, in other words, an API. What is meant here is the fact that you have a server running and accepting requests for prediction. All you have to do is to send an HTTP request with unseen data and the server will automatically response back with a predicted value.", "Below are some popular Python web frameworks you can use to build the backend.", "You can also read more about these frameworks here (Top 10 Python Web Frameworks to Learn).", "Keep in mind that there are two types of web frameworks in this list: full-stack and non-full stack. If you decided to build your application with micro-service architecture, then I would recommend you to use the non-full stack frameworks such as Flask as it is flexible, lightweight and container-friendly.", "After having the backend, your model now becomes a live service. However, you don\u2019t want users to enter a long request URL to get the prediction result.", "You need a User Interface (UI).", "You should know a frontend framework to help you build the UI communicating to the backend. For example, if you are building a web application to predict Iris Flower species, then the UI might have four input boxes to get user inputs for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and a submit button to get the prediction result. Right after the user hits the submit button, the frontend will construct the request URL with given parameters and send it to the backend where the model is serving. After that, the backend will respond back the predicted flower species which can be then displayed on the frontend.", "React, Vue.js and Angular are the top three popular frameworks at the time I am writing this article and you should pick one of them to learn.", "Environment dependency is a common problem when running your code on other machines or cloud platforms and in Software Engineer, Container is widely used to tackle this issue. In details, codes and necessary components needed to run the codes are packed inside a close box called Container. This container can be then deployed to run anywhere without worrying about dependency issues.", "Each container can be seen as a micro-service performing a simple function of a larger architecture in a way that if a service is down, it should not create a major disruption in the system and the recovery time should be minimal. With this in mind, being familiar with Docker Container is an essential skill that you should put on your resume.", "Container orchestration manages container life-cycle and ensuring the availability of each service running on the platform. For example, you may want to have three models online at the same time (replicas) so that if one model fails, the other two are still available to serve the users. It can also perform other tasks such as load balancing to help utilise all the available replicas and improve platform performance. For container orchestration, you should add Kubernetes into your wish list of skill-to-learn.", "In case a model is retrained or updated to include a new feature, it should be updated in the backend and this task should be done automatically to avoid human errors and shorten the update cycle to have a true agile experience. To make it seamless and to reduce human efforts when rolling out newer Machine Learning models for the container, it is recommended to use CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline.", "The CI/CD pipeline can be set up to perform the following tasks: retrain model, commit the newer model into Git repo, automatic testing and deploying ML model, etc. Some popular solutions for CI/CD are Travis CI, Jenkins and Gitlab CI and I personally prefer the last one as it includes Git repo and CI/CD pipeline in one single platform.", "Finally, when working as a Data Scientist, you should always keep your mind open for any possibilities so that you don\u2019t fall into the trap of bias and lock yourself from exploring more valuable insights. In other words, don\u2019t accept the result and jump into conclusion easily.", "Let\u2019s close this story by the famous example of Abraham Wald and the Missing Bullet Holes from Mother Jones.", "Back during World War II, the RAF lost a lot of planes to German anti-aircraft fire. So they decided to armor them up. But where to put the armor? The obvious answer was to look at planes that returned from missions, count up all the bullet holes in various places, and then put extra armor in the areas that attracted the most fire.", "Obvious but wrong. As Hungarian-born mathematician Abraham Wald explained at the time, if a plane makes it back safely even though it has, say, a bunch of bullet holes in its wings, it means that bullet holes in the wings aren\u2019t very dangerous. What you really want to do is armor up the areas that, on average, don\u2019t have any bullet holes.", "Why? Because planes with bullet holes in those places never made it back. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see any bullet holes there on the ones that do return. Clever!", "Attributions for icons used in the featured image", "Your home for data science.
