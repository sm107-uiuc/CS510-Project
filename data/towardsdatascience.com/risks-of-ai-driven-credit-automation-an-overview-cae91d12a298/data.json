Enterprise AI is increasingly being applied to transform and automate banking processes, including lending and credit value chains. This is quite an unprecedented move for a historically conservative industry, but desperate times call for desperate measures. AI is still a maturing technology and risks are yet to be understood and contained by its creators in the technology industry. AI risks and its impacts can magnify on the highly regulated large scale banking credit processes. Banks are well aware of this but they are running out of options as their profit margins are under attack from all directions and time is not on their side.", "Banks have been forced to deploy defensive strategies such as efficiency improvements and cost-cutting to maintain profit margins. In theory, this is where AI and automation are expected to save the day for the banking industry.", "The traditional credit is as old as the trade itself, and the core concept hasn\u2019t radically changed since the barter system-based crop loans were introduced in the ancient temples of Mesopotamia almost 4000 years ago. However, the credit processes, systems and utility have evolved since then to fuel massive expansion and progress of human civilisation. While non-bank lending plays a crucial role in the modern economy, the banks are still the sacrosanct modern temples of credit. The banks have built a formidable bastion of credit business since the early 1800s and successfully defended it from many disruptions. The latest disruptive onslaught, however, is unconventional and unchartered territory for banks. The current AI-driven disruption is maturing but cutting-edge technology, it fuels rapid change through fast-paced product and operations innovation and presents with a whole heap of unknown unknowns. This is hardly compatible with the current conservative banking business philosophy or business models. For the first time, the banks are facing a daunting enemy in themselves. The licensed and regulated banks are wound up in a labyrinth of regulations thanks to years of ducking and weaving through sub-standard credit practices. On one hand, the banking industry is trying to grapple with how AI impacts the compliance of existing banking and credit regulations and on the other, there is regulatory uncertainty on how the AI itself will be regulated.", "In spite of all the uncertainties, the banking industry is slowly but surely drawn to the unrelenting beats of AI and appear to be sleepwalking into the intelligent automation trap without fully realising the risks associated with it.", "In reality, a collective understanding of AI risks in the banking industry is years away. Before discussing risks, specifically AI model risk, it is worthwhile to understand how AI-driven automation is expected to reshape credit value chains and associated processes and technology in banks. Let\u2019s start with a satellite view at 100,000 ft and quickly descend to tackle the details of credit value chains and associated models and algorithms on the ground.", "Due to the exhilarating pace of advances in digital technology, we are believed to be living through the fourth industrial revolution, referred to as \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019. The pervasive influence behind this revolutionary phase sometimes referred to as \u2018Cyber-Physical Systems\u2019, is, in fact, Artificial Intelligence. Industry 4.0 is predominantly focused on infusing intelligence into every system and process to make them smart and autonomous.", "Further inquiry into industrial revolutions indicates that the \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019 and its predecessor have significantly contributed to the \u2018Digital Evolution\u2019. Digital Enterprises (DE) are believed to be evolving in three distinct yet interlinked phases. DE 1.0, is predominantly focused on the development of technology such as personal computers and software while DE 2.0 is all about advances in mobility and interconnectivity. The latest phase DE 3.0 is about leveraging the technology infrastructure and infusing intelligence to make processes and systems smart and autonomous. Most of DE 3.0 enterprises today are BigTech firms and have mastered the technology infrastructure to leverage AI. Most conventional banks have just embarked on upgrading their legacy systems and nowhere near to realise the full potential of AI yet. Ideally, the transitions between stages should be a gradual evolution where organisations have the opportunity to build, digest and sustain. The banking industry doesn\u2019t appear to have the time, skills or resources to attain the required level of technological maturity before attempting to deploy AI at scale. The banks are aspiring to be technology enterprises and that might very well be a valid strategic option. But, the business models and culture of regulated banks haven\u2019t changed significantly to align with technology-driven strategy.", "The build-up of AI risks in the system can be compared to the \u2018boiling frog\u2019 scenario where risks simmer before taking a sudden catastrophic turn. Banks are in some way facing their own \u2018Kodak moment\u2019.", "Artificial Intelligence as an aspiration or an abstract idea is as old as the human thought itself, albeit, it was probably never conceived as a technological eventuality. While AI as a concrete concept and a branch of computer science has been in gestation since the 1950s, it didn\u2019t deliver any commercial benefits till the early 2010s. AI only started to make commercial sense when it merged with the digital evolution. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a reputed spearhead in cutting-edge AI research, has classified AI evolution into three waves. The waves are referred to as Handcrafted Knowledge, Statistical Learning and Contextual Adaptation. Today\u2019s AI falls under wave 1 and 2 but still some way from explaining their behaviours and outcomes.", "Explainability and transparency are some of the biggest challenges facing effective AI implementation in credit and banking. Regulators require banks to be able to explain lending and credit decisions and provide full disclosure of reasons behind approval or denial of credit decisions.", "Besides, digital evolution DE 3.0 is a necessary technology ecosystem to leverage the full potential of AI and manage its risks adequately. The banks are estimated to be 10 to 15 years behind in achieving DE 3.0 maturity.", "Artificial Intelligence is a system that combines data, business logic, and machine/statistical learning models to influence or automate a process. While this takes a computer science approach to describe AI and isn\u2019t necessarily the academic definition of AI, it is a useful one to understand AI from an applied model risk perspective. The DARPA inspired classifications are a better way to understand AI contextually than standard definitions.", "Banks already extensively use models and tools to generate business insights, automate processes and make business decisions. Any standard retail and commercial bank model inventory can have financial and non-financial models that run into hundreds if not thousands. Large retail and corporate banks can have anywhere between 1,000 to 2,500 tools and models.", "Majority of the bank models belong to wave 1 & 2 of DARPA classification discussed above. Most wave 2 (statistical learning) credit and lending models are developed and deployed to support advanced Basel II & III accreditation.", "From a credit perspective, models predominantly belong to retail and non-retail (corporate) portfolios. However, it is worthwhile to consider the credit-related market and market risk models and credit-related operational and operational risk models including credit strategy (risk appetite).", "Banks spend most of their credit modelling energy to comply with a myriad of regulatory requirements around risk reporting. The true potential of advanced statistical learning models hardly ever plays a significant role in managing risks related to credit exposures and their operations. While regulatory requirements such as Basel and Dodd-Frank have forced banks to be more data-driven and objective underlying bank culture was never onboard. For example, credit model performance indicators hardly ever improved over the last decade but it was never an issue as it didn\u2019t make much business sense to invest and improve the model performance. The biggest risk to the banking credit models is not that the models could be potentially wrong but regulators would notice it and inflict heavy fines for non-compliance. Lack of competition from outside the industry, partly driven by their enormous size, resulted in banks being complacent and the regulatory box-ticking went on, until now.", "The competitive dynamics in the banking industry have suddenly changed, and the new players in BigTech, FinTech, TechFin, neo banks, etc. are nibbling away bank profits through one technology disruption at a time. The banks have successfully dealt with traditional competition and disruptions in past, but now they are facing a painful \u2018death by a thousand cut\u2019 scenario.", "Enterprise AI is sold as the silver bullet by the very industry which is also a strong contender to the profits through proprietary lending (Amazon), payments systems and credit cards (Apple, Google), cryptocurrency (Facebook), etc. Besides, they have access to more matured technology infrastructure and they are not shackled by regulations, at least as of now. The banks have little choice but to \u2018partner\u2019 with these tech giants to implement AI and automate the credit value chains. While the regulatory credit models are currently out of limits of advanced AI algorithms, the overall credit value chains are being automated at a rapid pace. The nextgen models are being developed using advanced AI algorithms to find good customers and engage, improve overall customer experience, develop individualised value propositions for customers, help banks to be efficient and ethical in their approach, manage collections, etc.", "Candidate AI algorithms already replicate most of the human brain\u2019s activities with varying levels of sophistication. A temptation to apply these capabilities to improve the customer value proposition and tackle competition is irresistible for banks. The whole host of these algorithms will likely be used to generate collective insights, enhance customer experience, and improve efficiency. It is already in play with chatbots, voice-enabled banking, intelligent credit policy consolidations, linking IoT data to automate liquidity and trade financing, trader and banker conversations analysis to improve sales opportunities, monitor the conduct and enhance customer service, etc. Some of these AI algorithms are complex, sophisticated and opaque but since they are not being applied to regulatory models they are considered as low in risk materiality.", "The temperature of the proverbial boiling pot appears to be increasing rather rapidly and the frog is still blissfully unaware.", "Banks are investing billions in transformation projects, aspiring to uplift credit and banking systems to make them AI-ready. Enterprise AI is expected to play an instrumental role in automating and infusing intelligence into credit and linked banking processes. But, the underlying transformation strategies are anything but AI-centric due to the current state of technological maturity and associated skills gap. Most banks are still transitioning from legacy systems (Digital Enterprise 1.0) to mobility and cloud-based infrastructure (Digital Enterprise 2.0). Banks are pushing to get data and infrastructure foundations right to be able to effectively leverage AI. This makes sense normally, but these are extraordinary times for banking and credit.", "Competition and cost pressures are unrelenting, and banks have started to drip-feed AI models into the banking ecosystem without a holistic AI strategy or regulatory guidelines. The juggling has just begun but it is about to become exponentially harder as more AI models feed into the ecosystem.", "Your home for data science.
