And they got me. I started to think, how could one of these new M1-powered MacBooks make their way into my life?", "Of course, I didn\u2019t need one but I kept wondering what story could I tell myself to justify purchasing another computer? Then I had it. My 16-inch MacBook Pro is too heavy to carry around all the time. Yeah, that\u2019ll do. This 2.0 kg aluminium powerhouse is too much to be galavanting.", "Wow. It\u2019s not even that heavy.", "C\u2019mon now\u2026 let\u2019s not let the truth get in the way of a good story.", "I had it. My reason for placing an order on a shiny new M1 MacBook (or two). My 16-inch MacBook is too heavy to lug around to cafes and write code, words, edit videos and check emails sporadically.", "And Apple seems to think their new M1 chip is 11x, 15x, 12x, 3x faster on a bunch of different things. Thought-provoking numbers but I\u2019ve never measured any of these in the past.", "All I care about is: can I do what I need to do, fast.", "The last word of the previous sentence is the most important. I\u2019ve become conditioned. Speed is a part of me now. Ever since the transition from hard drives to solid-state drives. And I\u2019m not going back.", "I bought the 16-inch in February 2020. I\u2019d just completed a large project and was flush with cash, so I decided to future proof my work station. Since I edit videos daily and hate lag, I opted for the biggest dawg I could buy and basically maxed everything except for the storage (see the specs below).", "Thankfully I\u2019ve still got a friend at Apple who was able to apply their employee discount to the beast (shout out to Joey).", "Anyway, we\u2019ve discussed my primary criteria: speed. Let\u2019s consider the others:", "But really, I\u2019m a nerd. And an Apple fan. Plus, I wanted to see how my big-dawg-almost-top-of-the-line 16-inch MacBook Pro faired against the new M1 chip-powered MacBook\u2019s.", "Plus, I can\u2019t remember being this excited for a new computing device since the original iPhone.", "Other reasons include: carrying around a lighter laptop and tax benefits (if I buy another machine before the end of the year, I can claim it on tax).", "Whenever I buy a new machine, I usually upgrade the RAM and the storage at least a step or two from baseline.", "512GB storage and 16GB RAM seems to be the minimum for me these days (seriously, who is running a 128GB MacBook effectively?).", "So for the M1 MacBook\u2019s, I upgraded both of their RAM from 8GB to 16GB and for the 13-inch Pro, I upgraded from 256GB to 512GB storage.", "The 16-inch MacBook is my current machine, which I\u2019ve never had a problem with until running the tests below.", "Apple\u2019s graphs were impressive. And the GeekBench scores were even more impressive. But these are just numbers on a page to me. I wanted to see how these machines performed doing what I\u2019d actually do day-to-day:", "Reflecting on the above, I devised three tests:", "These are enough for me. I\u2019ve got other sh*t to do.", "Alright, time for the results. The best results for each experiment have been highlighted in bold.", "For this one, all machines were given ample time to pre-render the raw footage. So when the export button got clicked, they all should\u2019ve been relatively on the same page.", "No surprise here, the 16-inch MacBook Pro exported in the fastest time. Most likely because of the dedicated 8GB GPU or 64GB of RAM.", "However, it seems using the dedicated GPU came at the cost of battery life drain and fan speed (in the video you can hear the fans going off like a jet).", "During the video export, the M1-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13-inch remained completely silent (the MacBook Air had no choice, it doesn\u2019t have a fan but the MacBook Pro 13-inch\u2019s fan never turned on).", "I\u2019ve never actually used a machine learning model trained by CreateML. However, I decided to see how one of Apple\u2019s custom apps would leverage their new silicon.", "For this test, each MacBook was setup with the following CreateML settings:", "Potentially the most surprising result of all the tests is that the M1 MacBook Air won this one by a clear margin, both in training time and battery life. All the while without a fan and one less GPU than the MacBook Pro 13-inch (the MacBook Air I used has an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU M1 chip).", "It\u2019s also quite clear the CreateML app has potentially been optimised for the M1 chip. As, despite having 8 CPU cores and a dedicated GPU, the 16-inch Intel-powered MacBook Pro ran out of juice before finishing the experiment.", "During the M1 announcement keynote, Apple claimed their new silicon was capable of \u201crunning popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow\u201d at much greater speeds than previous generations.", "Hearing this forced me to sit up a little straighter.", "Did they just say TensorFlow? Natively?", "I read back through the announcement.", "Yes. They did. They said TensorFlow.", "Then I found the blog posts by the TensorFlow team and Apple Machine Learning team showcasing the new results on the M1 chips and Intel-based Macs. Turns out, Apple recently released a fork of TensorFlow, tensorflow_macos which allows you to run native TensorFlow code right on your Mac (something which was previously a pain in the ass, actually, not really, I hear PlaidML has made it easier but I haven't tried that).", "Naturally, after hearing this news, I had to try it.", "By some miracle, I installed Apple\u2019s fork of TensorFlow into a Python 3.8 environment without 8\u201310 hours of troubleshooting and created the following mini-experiments:", "I copied the CNN architecture on the CNN explainer website (TinyVGG). And used similar data to the CreateML test.", "These days I rarely build models from scratch. I use either an existing untrained architecture and train it on my own data or a pretrained architecture like EfficientNet and fine-tune it on my own data.", "Browsing Apple\u2019s tensorflow_macos GitHub, I came across an issue thread containing a benchmark a fair few people had run on their various machines. So I decided to include it in my testing.", "As well as running the above three experiments on all of the MacBook\u2019s I had, I also ran them on a GPU-powered Google Colab instance as a control (my usual workflow is: experiment on Google Colab, scale up on larger cloud servers when needed).", "The Google Colab GPU-powered instance performed the fastest across all three tests.", "Notably, the M1 machines significantly outperformed the Intel machine in the Basic CNN and Transfer learning experiments.", "However, the Intel-powered machine clawed back some ground on the tensorflow_macos benchmark. I believe this was due to explicitly telling TensorFlow to use the GPU, using the lines:", "I tried running these lines with the previous two experiments and it didn\u2019t make a difference. Perhaps, it\u2019s something to do with the different data loading schemes used between the Basic CNN/Transfer learning setup and the tensorflow_macosbenchmark.", "See all code experiments in the accompanying Google Colab Notebook.", "If you\u2019re buying a laptop, you want to be able to move it around. Perhaps write some words while looking at the beach or code up your latest experiment whilst sipping coffee at your local cafe.", "So what we have here is a compilation of the various amounts of battery used over the three experiments, plus a new portability score I\u2019ve invented.", "The M1 Macs crushed it here. Finishing all tests with over 30% of battery left each. The MacBook Air was again the standout, using the least amount of power and scoring the lowest on the portability score.", "Anyone want to buy a second-hand close-to-top-spec MacBook Pro 16-inch? Its been well looked after, I promise.", "After running the above experiments and using the M1 MacBooks for a couple of weeks, it looks like the graphs Apple showed were pretty close to reality. And all those raving reviews? Well, in my experience, they\u2019re correct too.", "I originally bought the 16-inch MacBook Pro to be a powerhouse, a speed machine. And it is that. But so are the M1 machines. Except the M1 machines are lighter, quieter and have better battery life.", "The only test the MacBook Pro 16-inch won on was the video rendering test (and of course screen size). And even then, the results weren\u2019t dramatically better, certainly not \u201cthis machine costs 2.5x more better\u201d.", "I\u2019m keeping the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The little extra boost for video editing won it over the 13-inch Air (plus, I edited the entire video version of this article on the 13-inch Pro without a single hiccup). I\u2019ll use it as a portable machine and probably set my 16-inch up as a permanent desktop.", "But the Air\u2026 Oh the Air\u2026 I remember when I worked at Apple Retail, I\u2019d tell customers to get the Air if they were only concerned with word processing and browsing the web. Now you can train machine learning models on it.", "\u201cI write code, words and browse the web.\u201d Or \u201cI just want a portable, capable machine.\u201d", "Get the MacBook Air, you won\u2019t be disappointed. It\u2019s what I\u2019d get if I didn\u2019t edit videos daily.", "\u201cI write code, words, browse the web and edit videos.\u201d", "From my tests, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro or M1 MacBook Air will perform at 70\u201390% of what a nearly-top-spec Intel 16-inch MacBook Pro can offer, so either of those would be phenomenal. For a slight edge on video editing, you might opt for the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro.", "\u201cI want a larger screen size and don\u2019t care about cost.\u201d", "As of now, the only valid reason I\u2019d consider buying an Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro would be if screen size was of utmost importance to you and you didn\u2019t have a budget.", "Screen size doesn\u2019t matter so much to me as most of the time I\u2019m running a single full-screen app or two apps split down the middle of the screen. Or if I do want to run multiple apps, I\u2019ll plug my machine into an external monitor (note: for now the M1 Macs only support a single external monitor, so for the 3+ monitor fans out there, you\u2019ll need an Intel-based Mac).", "This being said, even if you were after a larger screen, I\u2019d hold off and wait for the Apple silicon 16-inch.", "As I said, I had no problems with 16-inch MacBook Pro. But in comparison to these new M1 MacBook\u2019s, it feels dated.", "I haven\u2019t been this impressed with a new computer since I first switched from hard drive to solid-state drive.", "I\u2019m writing this on the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro and it feels like butter. The little things, the instance wake, the new keyboard style, the native Apple apps, the battery life, they all add up.", "If Apple were capable of pulling off these kinds of performance improvements with a 1st-generation chip in a laptop (even one without a fan), I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going to happen on the machines without power constraints (the Mac mini hints at the potential here).", "How about a 16-inch with an M2?", "Hopefully they wait at least another year, I mean, my Intel-based 16-inch isn\u2019t even a year old yet\u2026", "PS you can see the video version of this article, including all of the tests above being run on YouTube:", "Your home for data science.
