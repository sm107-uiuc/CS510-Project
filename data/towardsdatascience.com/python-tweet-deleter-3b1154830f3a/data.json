It\u2019s going to be a long one, but once you follow along you\u2019ll be fine. You might want to delete your tweets for a couple of reasons. It could be because your old tweets are embarrassing or you want to let go of ignorant opinions from your past. Whatever the reason, this python tutorial is definitely going to be worth it.", "I started out with this article written by Kris Shaffer close to four years ago, but got stuck when I realized the twitter data I had downloaded was in a different format from his. I then headed to google so that I didn\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. The resources I found were mostly source codes on GitHub so I tried them out and fixed some bugs as well, obviously.", "Before we proceed to the main tutorial about how to get your tweets deleted, you would have to sign up for a twitter developer account and download you twitter archive. Follow this link to download your twitter archive. After downloading your .zip file, unzip it and extract a file with the name \u2018tweet.js\u2019 located in the \u2018data\u2019 folder.", "You\u2019ll need access to the Twitter API, click this and then fill the form. It\u2019s pretty simple. After completing it, you\u2019ll be given your keys and tokens (consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret) which are vital for the code below to run successfully. Also, don\u2019t share your keys with anyone. Be genuine with this step otherwise your account could get blocked by twitter.", "This process makes use of the python programming language, but you don\u2019t need to be a guru to follow the steps in this tutorial. I\u2019m going to walk you through how to freshly install python and all the modules used\u2026", "This is done on a Windows OS, but if you run a Mac OS or a Linux distro you can definitely follow on your systems as well. If you already have python on your system, skip step 1.", "1. Python installation. Start a windows command prompt (cmd) and run the command pythonIf you see a python version(eg: Python 3.7.3) in your terminal, you\u2019re good to go. Else, check out this video to get python installed on your computer. (see what I did there? for step one?\ud83d\udc40)", "2. Creating a virtual environment to install all modules used. First of all, create a folder, on your desktop called \u2018tweet deleter\u2019 where you can have all things related. Also, save your \u2018tweet.js\u2019 file to your \u2018tweet deleter\u2019 folder. Then, move into the directory where the venv* should be created(preferably in your \u2018tweet deleter\u2019 folder). Use the command cd(which stands for change directory) + folder name until you enter your \u2018tweetdeleter\u2019 folder. Lastly, run this command to create the tweetdeleter venv:python -m venv tweetdeleter", "3. Activating your venv Run the command tweetdeleter\\Scripts\\activate.bat", "4. Installing the packages in your \u2018tweetdeleter\u2019 venvThe following commands must be run in your terminal after your venv has been activated. pip install tweepy pip install datetime pip install jupyter notebookJupyter notebook is an IDE*(my go-to IDE), where you can run your code. If you already have one that you use, that\u2019s great! You don\u2019t need to install a new one then. It has a pretty simple interface, but I love it because it\u2019s great for exploring and visualizing data. To check if your packages have truly been installed, run the command \u2018pip freeze\u2019 or \u2018pip list\u2019 in your cmd terminal.", "5. Moving on to the point where we use the code and where you see results. a. Open your jupyter notebook by running the command jupyter notebook in your venv in cmd.", "Tweepy: Python module used to access the Twitter API(which has so many functions that you can play around with, like \u2018destroy_status\u2019, \u2018destroy_friendship\u2019, \u2018update_status\u2019 and many others). Tweepy is great for automating twitter processes and this story is a great example of that.  Datetime: Python module which helps with the manipulation of dates and time. Objects used are \u2018datetime\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019 of which differences and additions can be made. Datetime has other useful classes such as timedelta and datetime (which are seen in the script below). Json: In-built python module used for dealing with JSON(JavaScript object notation) data. I like to see jsons as a list of python dictionaries.", "The following python scripts will do all the hard work for you once you run it, so you can continue that task you never finished. You need to keep an eye on it though, so that you google any errors and check the progress you\u2019re making. There are three options to choose from, seen below\u2026", "This script has 6 blocks of code\u2026#Block1: Importing modules needed for the script to be run successfully.", "#Block2: Inputting your keys and tokens which will help you gain access to the Twitter API.", "#Block3: Using tweepy and the necessary keys to get the Twitter API authentication.", "#Block4: Creating the \u2018cutoff_date\u2019 variablecutoff_date will be the variable where we\u2019ll store the date before which you want all tweets to be deleted.The code for the variable moves back (because of the subtraction sign, \u2018-\u2019) a number of days you specify to a particular date in the past. You would have to chose a date, for which all tweets before it, should be deleted. That date would be calculated by doing this: The current date \u2014 the number of days. Here\u2019s an example. It\u2019s 7th November, 2020 today and for a cutoff date of 1st January, 2018, the \u2018days\u2019 value to put into the \u2018datetime.delta\u2019 function should be 1041.

In the code above, the slicing is done on the last 250 tweets which is written as \u2018250:\u2019 in terms of indexes.
