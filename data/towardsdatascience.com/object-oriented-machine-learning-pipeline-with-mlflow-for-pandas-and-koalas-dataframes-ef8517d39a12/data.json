This is achieved by:", "The end-to-end development process is based on the Cross-industry standard process for data mining. As shown in the diagram below, it consists of six major phases:", "Figure 1: CRISP-DM process diagram (refer to source in Wikipedia)", "For convenience of discussion, it is assumed that the following Python libraries have been installed on a local machine such as Mac:", "The reason of using Python 3.6 is that certain functionality (e.g., deployment) of the current release of mlflow does not work with Python 3.7.", "The first phase is business understanding. The key point in this phase is to understand the business problem to be solved. As an example, the following is a brief description of the Kaggle interview attendance problem:", "Given a set of questions that are asked by a recruiter while scheduling an interview with a candidate, how to use the answers to those questions from the candidate to predict whether the expected attendance will attend a scheduled interview (yes, no, or uncertain).", "Once the business problem is understood, the next step is to identify where (i.e., data sources) and how we should collect data from which a machine learning solution to the problem can be built.", "The dataset for the Kaggle interview attendance problem has been collected from the recruitment industry in India by the researchers over a period of more than 2 years between September 2014 and January 2017.", "This dataset is collected with labels (the column of Observed Attendance holds the labels) and thus it is suitable for supervised machine learning.", "The following code imports the necessary Python libraries for all the source code in this article, and loads the dataset into a Koalas DataFrame and displays the first five rows of the DataFrame as shown in the table above.", "The main goal of data preparation is to clean and transform a collected raw dataset into appropriate format so that the transformed data can be effectively consumed by a target machine learning model.", "In the interview attendance raw dataset, the column of Name(Cand ID) contains candidate unique identifiers, which do not have much prediction power and thus can be dropped. In addition, all of the columns (i.e., columns from _c22 to _c26 for Koalas DataFrame, or columns from Unnamed: 22 to Unnamed: 26 for Pandas DataFrame) have no data and thus can safely be dropped as well.", "Except for the date of interview, all of the other columns in the dataset have categorical (textual) values. In order to use machine learning to solve the problem, those categorical values must be transformed into numeric values because a machine learning model can only consume numeric data.", "The column of Date of Interview should be split into day, month, and year to increase prediction power since the information of individual day, month, and year tends to be more strongly correlated with seasonable jobs compared with a string of date as a whole.", "The columns of Nature of Skillset and Candidate Native location have a large number of unique entries. These will introduce a large number of new derived features after one-hot encoding. Too many features can lead to a curse of dimensionality problem in the case the size of dataset is not large enough. To alleviate such problem, the values of these two columns are redivided into a smaller number of buckets.", "The above data preprocessing/transformation can be summarized as following steps:", "These steps are implemented by developing an Object-Oriented data preprocessing pipeline for both Pandas and Koalas DataFrames by combining Pandas and Koalas DataFrames with scikit-learn pipeline API (i.e., BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, and Pipeline).", "Several data preprocessing steps share a common operation of transforming the values of a particular column in a DataFrame. But, as described in Koalas Series, a Koalas Series does not support some of the common Pandas DataFrame and Series indexing mechanisms such as df.iloc[0]. Because of this, there is no simple method of traversing and changing the values of a column in a Koalas DataFrame.", "The other difficulty is that Koalas does not allow to build a new Koalas Series object from scratch and then add it as a new column in an existing Koalas DataFrame. It only allows a new Koalas Series object that is built from the existing columns of a Koalas DataFrame.", "The difficulties above are avoided by defining a global function to call the apply() method of a Koalas Series object.", "To alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue, the transform() method of the BucketSkillset transformer class divides the unique values of the skillset column into smaller number of buckets by changing those values that appear less than 9 times as one same string value of Others.", "Similarly to bucketing skillset, to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue, the transform() method of the BucketLocation transformer class divides the unique values of the candidate native location column into smaller number of buckets by changing those values that appear less than 12 times into one same value of Others.", "The values of the column of Date of Interview are messy in that various formats are used. For instance not only different delimits are used to separate day, month, and year, but also different orders of day, month, and year are followed. This is handled by the _parseDate() and transform_date() methods of the ParseInterviewDate transformer class. The overall functionality of the transform() method is to separate the interview date string into values of individual day, month, and year.", "The transform() method of the FeaturesUppercase transformer class is to change the values of categorical features to uppercase and at the same time drop less useful features.", "The transform() method of the OneHotEncodeData transformer class calls the get_dummies() method of DataFrame to one-hot encode the values of categorical values.", "All of the data preprocessing transformers are combined into a scikit-learn pipeline as follows in the PreprocessData() method of the PredictInterview class (see Section 4.3 for details). The fit() and transform() methods of these transformers will be executed sequentially once the fit_transform() method of the pipeline object is called.", "Once the dataset has been prepared, the next step is modeling. The main goals of modeling include:", "There are three major high-level types of machine learning and deep learning algorithms/models:", "Supervised machine learning and deep learning can be divided into subtypes such as regression and classification. Each subtype includes various machine learning and deep learning algorithms/models. For instance, supervised machine learning classification models include Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, GBM classifier, etc.", "Generally speaking, given a business problem, there are many different types of models that can be used as possible solutions. These different models need to be compared to identify the most promising one as the solution to the target business problem. Thus model identification can not be done in isolation. It depends on model training and evaluation/comparison of model performance metrics.", "In this article we simply select the scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier model for demonstration purpose.", "Once a model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) is identified, typically there are multiple hyper-parameters to be tuned. A hyper-parameter is a parameter that needs to be set before a model training can begin and such hyper-parameter value does not change during model training. For example, the Random Forest Classifier has multiple hyper-parameters such as number of estimators, max depth, etc.", "The sciket-learn GridSearchCV is a popular library for searching the best combination of hyper-parameters of a given model by automatically executing an instance of the model many times. Each execution corresponds to a unique combination of the selected hyper-parameter values. The GridSearch class is to use this library to find the best combination of number of estimators and max depth:", "One designed functionality of mlflow is to track and compare the hyper-parameters and performance metrics of different model executions.", "The method of mlFlow() of the PredictInterview class is to train a model, use the trained model to predict results, obtain various model performance metrics, and then call the mlflow API to track both the hyper-parameters and performance metrics, and at the same time log a trained model into a file for later usage such as deployment.", "A Jupyter notebook of the PredictInterview class below and all the other pieces of source code in this article are available in Github [6].", "The code below shows how to instantiate an object of the PredictInterview class and then call its mlFlow() method.", "Once the hyper-parameters and performance metrics of a model have been tracked in mlflow, we can use a terminal or Jupyter notebook to start the mlflow UI (User Interface) as follows to view the history of model executions:", "Assuming that the mlflow UI starts on a local machine, the following IP address and port number can be used to view the results in a Web browser:", "The following picture is a snapshot of a model execution history in the mlflow UI:", "Figure 2: Tracking hyper-parameters and metrics in mlflow UI", "Once a machine learning model has been trained with expected performance, the next step is to assess the prediction results of the model in a controlled close-to-real settings to gain confidence that the model is valid, reliable, and meets business requirements of deployment.", "As an example, for the Kaggle interview attendance project, one possible method of evaluation is to use mlflow to deploy the model as a Web service and then develop a client program to call the model Web service to get the prediction results of a testing dataset after going through data preparation. These prediction results can then be used to generate a report (e.g., a table or csv file) for recruitment industry domain experts to review.", "As demonstration purpose, the following code uses the prediction results with a threshold of 0.5 to generate both a probability and a prediction for each of the candidates where the value in the \u201cObserved Attendance\u201d column is missing, and forms the results as a Pandas DataFrame.", "The following are the first 15 rows of the DataFrame:", "Once the model evaluation concludes that the model is ready for deployment, the final step is to deploy an evaluated model into a production system. As described in the book Data Science for Business, the specifics of deployment depend on the target production system.", "Taking the Kaggle interview attendance project as an example, one possible scenario is to deploy the model as a Web service on a server, which can be called by other components in a target production system to get prediction results for assisting job interview arrangement. In a more complicated scenario that the development of the target production system is based on a programming language (e.g., Java) that is different from the modeling language (e.g., Python), then the chance is that the model needs to be reimplemented in the target programming language as a component of the production system.", "As described before, a trained model has been logged into a file during the process of tracking model executions in mlflow. The following screen snapshot shows the information of a logged model:", "Figure 3: Logging trained model in mlflow UI", "Similarly to the mlflow tutorial, the following code is to use the mlflow built-in functionality to start a logged model as a Web service:", "For simplicity, in this section, it is assumed that the test_df is a Pandas DataFrame with only one row of testing data (an interview attendance feature vector):", "The following code can be used to send the row of testing data to the model Web service to obtain the predicted interview attendance (1 - Yes, 0 - No):", "In this article, I used a close-to-real challenging dataset, the Interview Attendance Problem for Kaggle competition, to demonstrate an end-to-end process of developing an Object-Oriented machine learning pipeline in Python for both Pandas and Koalas DataFrames by combining Pandas and Koalas DataFrame with scikit-learn pipeline API and mlflow.
