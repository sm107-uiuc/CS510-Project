Rather than the letters used, we\u2019ll score words based on how difficult they are to understand.", "And here\u2019s how we measure that difficulty. We\u2019ll grab a copy of the Meriam-Webster dictionary and we look up that word. To learn a word in English, I read the definition. At this point, I have learned the meaning of the original word. However, to fully understand a word, I need to know the meaning of every word in its definition. And I need to do this for every definition. Consider the example below.", "Let\u2019s say I\u2019m starting the game of Scrabble with the word university. Meriam-Webster defines university as (This is starting to sound like a valedictorian speech\u2026) an institution of higher learning providing facilities for teaching and research and authorized to grant academic degrees. For this game, let\u2019s suppose we have already learned all the stop words in English. These are words like an, of, for, your, again, only, to, etc. At this point, I know the definition of the word university. But I still need to learn the meaning of the following words: institution, higher, learning, providing, facilities, teaching, research, authorized, grant, academic, and degrees. So, we look at the definition of an institution, we learn all the words in that definition, and we keep chugging along.", "There is a little Catch-22 in this game. How can I learn the word university if I don\u2019t know what institution means? It doesn\u2019t make much sense. But we need this caveat to prevent an infinite loop.", "For example, suppose I wanted to learn the word number. Its definition is a sum of units. After a while, I\u2019ll need to take a look at the definition of a unit, which is the first and least natural number. Again, after a bit, I\u2019ll need to learn what number means. A number is a sum of units. A unit is the least natural number. A number is a unit. A unit is a number. We have created an infinite loop and so we can\u2019t learn anything!", "I also recognize this is a simplified approach. For example, let\u2019s say I want to go into Computer Science so I want to look up the word Python. We only consider the first definition, which is any of the various large constricting snakes. The code below was written in Python but it wasn\u2019t written in a large constricting snake. Nevertheless, we use this situation to reduce the computational complexity.", "Meriam Webster has an API \u2014 an application programming interface. Think of it as an online dictionary. I can tell my computer to ask Meriam and Webster for the definition and they\u2019ll send it back. We\u2019ll have to clean it up and format it a bit but after that, we\u2019ll be on our way.", "We\u2019ll need to keep track of three sets. The first is a set of stop words (words like a, and, for, that, etc. from above). The second is the set of known words \u2014 these are words whose definitions we have already looked up. Our last set is a set of unknown words. When we get a definition, we can look at each word. If it\u2019s a stop word, we already know it. If it\u2019s a word we\u2019ve looked up before, great! We know the definition and can move on. However, if we come across an unknown word, we\u2019ll have to add it to the set of unknown words and take a look at it later (maybe right now, maybe later).", "For anyone interested in seeing the code, check it out here.", "The first word I tried out was python. To understand the definition of the word python, we need to learn 11,227 other words! Here is some of the output from our code.", "The graph below shows the number of unknown words for every 500 iterations. In the graph of the number of unknown words, we see a sharp spike in the beginning. After about 25,000 iterations, for any arbitrary definition, we know more words in the definition than we don\u2019t. This pattern continues and we slowly narrow in on the unknown words.", "We needed to learn 11,227 other words to understand python. However, it only takes 4,999 words to understand the definition of silly. Doctor takes 11,221 words. And computer takes 11,202. I choose these words relatively arbitrarily so three of them requiring ~11,210 words seems a bit suspect. Especially since Meriam Webster lists over 171,476 words in their dictionary.", "If you\u2019d like to investigate that further or if you\u2019d like to play around with the code, check out the repository here. You\u2019ll need an API key from Meriam-Webster but you can get one easily here. Happy Searching!", "Questions? Comments? Email me at andrew.oliver.medium@gmail.com.
