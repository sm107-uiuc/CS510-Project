However, it might be hard to find one article that summarizes all these and many other basic questions. In addition, you may be surprised, but some important questions don\u2019t have such accessible answers.", "My goal was to write a guide that summarizes the DBSCAN method, answers all these questions and more. I find the DBSCAN algorithm less intuitive than other popular clustering methods like K-means and Hierarchical Clustering, so I\u2019m going to use a lot of examples and I guarantee that by the end of the article you\u2019ll understand the method.", "Two popular types of clustering methods are: partitioning and hierarchical methods.", "Partitioning method partitions the dataset to k (the main input of the methods) number of groups (clusters). The Partition iterative process allocates each point or object (from now I will refer to it as a point) in the dataset to the group it belongs to. After the points are allocated in its group, the mean of the group (its centroid) is calculated by taking an average for all the points in the group. The most well-known Partitioning method is K-means. The partition methods have some significant drawbacks: you should know beforehand into how many groups you want to split the database (the K value). Another important drawback is that K-means does not perform well on finding non-convex/non-spherical shapes of clusters (figure1). In addition, K-means is sensitive to noise data.", "A Hierarchical method creates a Hierarchical visual representation for the data using a special tree (dendrogram). An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method starts when each point in its cluster and in each step it merges similar or close clusters to one cluster. In the final step all the points are in the same cluster. In contradiction to K-means, you don\u2019t need to decide what should be the number of clusters, but it also has some serious drawbacks: it isn\u2019t suitable for big datasets, has high computational complexity, you need to choose the metric for merging the clusters (linkage) that affects the clustering result. Furthermore, each metric has its drawbacks: sensitivity to noise, difficulty in dealing with severe differences in the density of clusters, and sensitivity to shape and size of clusters.", "As we can see the main disadvantages of partitioning and hierarchical methods are: handling noise and getting bad results with finding clusters of nonspherical shape.", "The DBSCAN clustering method is able to represent clusters of arbitrary shape and to handle noise.", "Let\u2019s think about a very big city with a lot of residents and tourists. Imagine that there is a small village just a short drive away. If we would take an alien to both places, although they are very close, he could easily tell that they are completely different places. Yes, the view, area, buildings, and many other aspects are completely different. But there is one aspect that is relevant for our case \u2014 the density of the places. The city is crowded, with a lot of locals and tourists, whereas the village is small with significantly fewer people.", "Differing groups of points by their density is the main idea of the DBSCAN.", "The DBSCAN groups together points with a dense neighborhood into clusters.", "A point will be considered as crowded if it has many other neighbors points near it. The DBSCAN finds these crowded points and places them and their neighbors in a cluster.", "The DBSCAN has two main parameters -", "Some books and articles describe the \u03b5-neighborhood of x as:", "In figure 3, we can see how different sizes of \u03b5 define the \u03b5-neighborhood of x.", "Now, you are probably asking yourself why is it a density-based cluster? Would a very dense neighborhood and sparse one be considered as two different neighborhoods (figure 4) and later on be separated into two different clusters?", "Point x and its neighbors would be in one neighborhood and y and its few neighbors would be in another. In the end, however, point x and its neighbors would probably be in one cluster whereas point y and its neighbor would be considered as outliers or noise. This is because the \u03b5-neighborhood of y isn\u2019t dense enough. As a neighborhood contains more points, the denser it becomes.", "How can we define if a neighborhood is dense enough? In order to do that, the DBSCAN uses the MinPts parameter.", "MinPts \u2014 The density threshold. If a neighborhood includes at least MinPts points, it will be considered as a dense region. Alternatively, a point will be considered as dense if there are at least the value of MinPts points in its \u03b5-neighborhood. These dense points are called core points.", "Let\u2019s check again figure 4, if the MinPts parameter is 3, point x will be a core point because the size of its \u03b5-neighborhood is 9 and it\u2019s bigger than 3.

Point y isn\u2019t a core point because it has less than 11 points in its \u03b5-neighborhood, but because it belongs to the \u03b5-neighborhood of point x, and point x is a core point, point y is a border point. We can easily see that point z isn\u2019t a core point. It belongs to the \u03b5-neighborhood of point y, and point y isn\u2019t a core point, therefore point z is a noise point.", "Now that we see the core points and border points will be in a cluster, how does the DBSCAN know which point goes to which cluster?

Notice that point x isn\u2019t directly density reachable from point y, because point y isn\u2019t a core point.", "Density reachable \u2014 point y is density reachable from point x, if there is a path of points between point x and point y, where each point in the path is directly reachable from the previous point. This means that all the points on the path are core points, with the possible exception of point y. We can see an example in figure 6.", "A point q is reachable from core point p if there is a path P\u2081,P\u2082\u2026, P\u2099 with P\u2081 = p and P\u2099 = q, that all points on the path are core points, with the possible exception of point q.", "Density-connected- a point x is density-connected to a point y, if there is a point o that both x and y are density-reachable from.

We will finish when all the points in the dataset have been visited.", "An illustration for the algorithm -", "I recommend to check this DBSCAN toy example (Schubert, 2018)", "This is the million-dollar question. First, I will define some terms:", "Function k-distance(p): distance from point p to its k-nearest neighbor (the user chooses the K value).

A large value for \u03b5 may cause a huge amount of points to be in the same cluster.", "As said before, one of the main advantages of the DBSCAN is that it detects noise. According to a research made in 2017 by Schubert, Sander, et al, the desirable amount of noise will usually be between 1% and 30%. Another insight from that research is that if one of the clusters contains many (20%-50%) points of the dataset, it indicates that you should choose a smaller value for \u03b5 or to try another clustering method.", "In general, \u03b5 should be chosen as small as possible.", "According to the originators of the DBSCAN algorithm (Ester, Kriegel, Sander and Xu, 1996) we can use this heuristic to find \u03b5 and MinPts :", "For a given k we build the sorted k-dist graph. The threshold point is the first point in the first \u201cvalley\u201d of the sorted k-dist graph. The k-dist value of the threshold will be the \u03b5 value. The research indicates that the k-dist graphs for k > 4 don\u2019t differ significantly from the 4-dist graph and they need considerably more computation. Therefore, they eliminate the parameter MinPts by setting it to 4 for all databases (for 2-dimensional data). The 4-dist value of the threshold point is used as the \u03b5 value for DBSCAN.", "If you don\u2019t want the MinPts value to be 4, you can decide the MinPts = k+1. A heuristic to choose k, is to set k to 2 \u2217 dimensions -1 (Sander, Ester et al., 1998).", "Another heuristic to choose MinPts value-", "Where P\u1d62 is the number of points in \u03b5-neighborhood of point i, and n is the number of points in the dataset.
