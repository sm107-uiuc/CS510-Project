Despite numerous attempts by the academia to attract women and to establish gender equality in their computer science classes, it is the activities of organizations such as WIDS that have been effective in sprouting interest and in opening doors for women scientists.", "Once a year, several worldwide events and competitions are helping the promotion of Women In Data Science (WIDS). One such event is a Kaggle competition entitled \u201cWiDS Datathon 2020\u201d, which has become a tradition for numerous aspiring female data-scientists.", "The goal for this year\u2019s competition was to predict whether an admitted patient survives in an intensive care unit (binary classification problem), given that data records of his or her 24-hour admission-chart and personal demographic data are accessible.", "The contenders were provided with a dataset over than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visit records from patients. Spanning a one-year time frame with diverse geographical spans from hospitals in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States.", "Naturally, this type of prediction model (patient\u2019s survival probability) can be beneficial in the prioritization and decision-making process of how urgent is it to treat a patient in the intensive care unit. It may help fighting morbidity in these units (though today, Coronavirus situation probably affects the accuracy of the model since the trained statistical distribution did not include corona infected patients!).", "It was a thought-provoking tabular-analysis based competition! Nine hundred fifty-one groups of data scientists from all over the world participated in one condensed and tight race.", "Typical of a classic tabular classification problem in Machine Learning, we had to use several tricks in each phase of the pipeline. At the same time, we also incorporated state-of-the-art Ensembling techniques and innovative Test Time Augmentations (TTA) for tabular data. For a deep technical dive into our solution, refer to this link here.", "In this article, I\u2019d like to share some key success factors, which are highly relevant to the Data Science development lifecycle.", "Our team consisted of several Kaggle evangelists: First and foremost, Seffi Cohen, who is already a master in Kaggle competitions, Dan Ofer, Noa Dagan (MD.), and me (Nurit). What made this team SO unique is that all the members have an extensive background in practical data science amalgamated with a strong background in healthcare.", "A brief outline of our mode of attack will prove instructive in dealing with similar problems at hand:", "Our plan of attack was to \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d. We distributed the workload amongst the team members, and every one of us concentrated on his or her specific task. It so happened that each part scored well on the leaderboard on its own (both the cross-validation score and leaderboard).", "However, in the end \u2014 we integrated the different submissions into one a central pipeline. We ensembled the models into the final submission, which resulted in our most exceptional score as yet.", "It\u2019s highly essential to divide the workload with minimal overlap and plan the integration of each outcome way ahead.", "Luckily, we had a medical doctor on board! Our team member, Noa.", "We placed a substantial effort in the first phase of the pipeline, commonly known as the exploratory data analysis (EDA).", "We explored each one of the 183 independent features (co-variates) and their correlation with the Binary target variable \u201chospital_death\u201d. This gave us an edge over the other teams because we discovered a real treasure beneath the features. No stone was left unturned in our quest for a top-performing model.", "With this domain knowledge at-hand, we planned the next parts of the ML pipeline; we smartly imputed the missing values and extracted new features. All of this improved our leader board score dramatically!", "For example, we created a \u201cgolden\u201d feature called \u201cmostly_dead\u201d, that grouped insights from different biological functions or measures that were not compatible with life (and provided an excellent outcome separation).", "There\u2019s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead; mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there\u2019s usually only one thing you can do. (Source: The Princess Bride)", "To make a long story short, domain experts\u2019 involvement is vital in getting better results in the data science development process!", "A Forbes survey claims that \u201cdata scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis. 76% of data scientists view data preparation as the least enjoyable part of their work\u201d.", "Well, it\u2019s true. We spent a lot of time creating what we perceived as the perfect feature engineering procedure that we could envision, considering the time frame of the competition (6 weeks).", "Robust feature engineering is very rewarding.", "I can attest to this fact. A single model would have landed us at the 14th place in this same competition!", "So if you can allocate enough time to do your best in this phase, even though sometimes it may be perceived as the least enjoyable one, rest assured that it\u2019s going to be highly rewarding.", "We tried a variety of automatic machine learning (AutoML) tools. They resulted in mediocre scores (in the cross-validation phase and on the leaderboard). Though, all the tools are good enough if you only want to use them when trying to accept or rejects a hypothesis before you commit to the process of developing a data science-based project. I guess for some projects, the results from these tools are good enough.", "We did use some advanced techniques to enhance the H2O pipeline with coding. That contributed a little to our success. We also used Sparkbeyond to \u201cbrute force\u201d features extraction.", "To summarize, competitions are fought tooth and nail. The winner is judged down to the fifth digit after the floating-point, and good enough is just not simple enough. Using parts of an AutoML tool with the involvement of human data scientist may or may not help.", "Of course, we tried a combination of hundreds of model instances, in more than 100 different experiments. Besides, novel and irregular implementation of Test Time Augmentation (TTA) on tabular data.", "This well-known and proven trick always works in competitions. We used diverse data sets \u2014 imputation techniques, features, and data generation. Also, the phase of feature selection was conducted from 7 different methods.", "So, on top of our robust feature engineering mentioned above, that could have brought us to the 14th place there was an elegant, novel ensemble that landed us in the 1st place\u2026", "Having a competition always pushes you towards excellence, you try your best and then make some improvements every day ;)", "To summarize my takeaways from this exciting experience: I think that our secret sauce was an ensemble of diverse methods and teammates. Both contributed substantially to successfully finding a resolution for the data science problem in this competition.", "Choosing the right team is vital because different skill sets and expertise give us different points of view and methodologies. And of course, the accurate teamwork because data science is a team sport!", "Data & AI strategist at days and enthusiastic Kaggler at nights", "Thanks to Shlomo Kashani for his enlightening remarks", "Your home for data science.
