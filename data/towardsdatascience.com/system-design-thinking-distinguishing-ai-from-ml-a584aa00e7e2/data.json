Most of the definitions are on lighter note. The one I like the most is:", "If it is on PowerPoint, it is probably AI. If it is in code, it is ML.", "Most definitions are not serious because there is no clear outcome expected from such definition.", "Let us quickly give one serious purpose \u2014 career fitment.", "The problem statement is like this. You have two people one is very experienced in multiple systems but less experienced on ML. The second is very young one with ML-specific experience. For the given project, you should check whether you have roles for both. If you have only one role, you should decide whom to keep.", "From this, we will delve into a case study. As we progress, we just outline the main thoughts we get and main problems we try to solve. From this, we will segregate what is ML and AI. After that, let us check the kind of experience and maturity necessary to finish it.", "This is a case study of agriculture AI. This should help in corn field monitoring. The image based system needs to provide warning about the disease so that the farmer could attend it and contain the problem quickly.", "A drone periodically flies over the field and collects images. These images are to be used for prediction of disease symptoms. Let us assume that we need to provide 3 labels \u2014 healthy, early stage disease, advanced stage disease.", "For the case study above, ML involves the machine learning tasks which we see in all the tutorials.", "\u00b7 We have images used for training & test sets.", "\u00b7 Finally we have some images provided by end customers.", "While creating the good model, we might tune hyper-parameters, change the model architecture, change the model itself. We might go for synthetic images too. We might go for all the ML techniques we have ever known.", "The requirement says we need 3 labels. Probably, we would create 3 folders for respective images. We would consider that each folder name signifies the respective label name, to keep it simple. We would use these for training. Everything looks good. The validation image prediction also looks fine.", "After we created our model and after tests are done, confusion matrix looks fine. The false positives and true negatives are within the statistics requirements.", "If this is all going fine and if this is machine learning what is AI?", "After ML prediction was good, the team showed ML prediction demo to a farmer. But a farmer gave another image. This prediction went totally wrong. It had an early stage disease. It could not be detected. The farmer is very upset.", "\u201cSir, I do not mind if there is minor hassle of going to the field even while it is healthy. Even if it wrongly notifies me, it is alright. But if there is disease symptom that goes undetected, then it is a huge problem for me. I have hectares of crop and I need to know where I should focus the most, at any given time. I have time. Your system should give me the priority region to focus on.\u201d", "The team realized that they had not considered such image at all. They focused on accuracy improvement with the data set they had. They focused on accuracy percentage. They had hit over-fitting problem.", "The statistics of acceptable accuracy is of no consequence to this customer. He does not mind if we prompt him even with low confidence prediction. He wants us to err on the side of caution.", "They were good with Machine Learning. But did not do enough at system-level AI.", "Now, consider a totally different project \u2014 a case of 7\u201311 shop owner. He wants a CCTV monitoring system for detecting shop theft and instant alarm. This particular guy wants a system where he does not mind minor loss. But the reputation of his customers and faux pass of false alarm is a bigger concern. If regular customers are embarrassed with false alarm and if they never return, it is a bigger loss. He only wants very clear cases of shop lifting reported. This customer also wants us to err on the side of caution, but in opposite direction.", "We just talked about the business impact and accuracy. We could also look at the other aspects. Let us go back to the corn field.", "The team finds that false positives increased significantly with another set of images. After deeper inspection, team found that the corn in these images are bigger. Only then the team realized that corn crop\u2019s period is about 100 days! they took images of only one instance in this long period. The training images need to be taken very frequently \u2014 probably every day? The visual features of healthy and unhealthy change drastically every few days. Now there are multiple difficulties.", "If they keep all the healthy images in one folder, the model can not learn anything useful. Just watch the two images below.", "These two images are so different. In the first one, the crop is too small and in the second it is quite grown. The images are from totally different angles. It is hard to imagine what the model could learn.", "Appears like, it makes sense to have different folders for different days of image. Earlier there was one common folder for one label.", "The process of the image recording also needs to be defined. The drones shall fly at same altitude and at same pre-determined route. Further, the time of the day also shall be fixed in order to ensure that the color or other properties are not affected due to change in light. Also the data needs to consider shade from cloud.", "Okay.. Now there is have large data set, segregated by day. Then the trained model also should be separated by day? i.e. to predict the disease possibility on day 1, can I train a common model for day 1, all the way, until day 100? This would lead to too many models.", "Hence, the team might have to split the model into few different models. May be one per weeks data. When the image is sent to the model for prediction, the meta data shall also have the day of the crop. Without it, system would not know which model to be used for prediction.", "For this case study, to justify the investment in system development, it should be usable across large areas and preferably across farmers, states, countries and even continents. It also would help to learn across larger dataset. If there is new kind of disease in one area, we should also be able to re-train the system to accommodate this new disease information.", "Important aspect of AI system is that it shall get better over time. ML alone does not guarantee it. It needs re-training policy and process.", "Suppose farmer finds a true negative, could there be easy way to make it and make such image available? If he is not a computer-literate, could label be done based on voice command? Upon he alerting the system that way, could the system be able to mark a subset of data, to be manually inspected? This would be very helpful. The project sponsor could employ part time contractors from farming background, to make such images to be having disease. Once the batch is done, retraining could be done.", "In ML, we just talk about train, cross-validate and predict. The re-training strategy is not discussed in algorithms. Only such end to end thinking, would result in true AI system.", "The system could also have more system engineering aspects to be considered. This could be the camera focus mode, speed of the drone while capturing images. While look at ML model\u2019s input shape, it has performance implication on prediction time and resources required. This in turn affects the use cases and system features we can offer.", "If there performance is good, we could do real time prediction while drone is flying. This could make the customer happier. This might require the team to reduce the resolution of the image for faster training and prediction. This could be one factor for ML model tuning.", "When we consider AI, we think about overall business processes. We also are concerned with the economics of the whole project. In projects involving people data, it could also involve legal issues.", "In safety related industries like automotive, industrial automation where this author worked, there is a need to even prove how the prediction works and how predictable is prediction!", "AI is more about the entire system, how the various actors, algorithms, business needs interplay. ML is mainly about the core technical part of the machine learning.", "As you could see, while we discussed about AI, we talked very less about the technical details and algorithms. We are more concerned with solution, deployment, user experience and many more. If we apply ML to very specific small tasks like finding duplicate images in mobile phone, the difference between ML and AI is not significant.", "As world moves to higher AI adoption, this distinction becomes increasingly significant.", "We have defined the difference in focus between ML and AI.", "Now let us get back to the original focus with which we started pondering. It is about fitting two employees to the right jobs.", "For the disease detection example we saw, the ML engineer can be someone training in machine learning. He or she could focus on algorithm, Python, Pytorch, Tensor Flow, model architecture, hyper-parameters, etc.", "To do the overall system architecture, to define business and technical processes for end usage and deployment, you need a solution architect. Even if such a person may not know very specific details of ML, he should be able to do good job on streamlining the solution and making it usable and making it a learning system.", "So, if there is an experienced software architect or business analyst with no ML background, do not fire him yet. May be such people might fit better for system-wide role in the project. For ML specific roles, of course, hire members with ML certifications.", "Yes. AI is for the PowerPoint and ML is for the code.", "Deeper we look into the meaning, more we learn. As we learn more, better we get at system design.", "Your home for data science.
