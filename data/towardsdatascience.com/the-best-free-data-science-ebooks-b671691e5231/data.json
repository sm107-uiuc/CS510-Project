The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting \u2014 the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.", "Description: Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops.", "Description: Bayesian Methods for Hackers is designed as an introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. Of course, as an introductory book, we can only leave it at that: an introductory book. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background or one who is not interested in mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining.", "Description: This book takes us on a journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories \u2014 Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian \u2014 individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The book integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference and ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.", "Description: This book is focused on the details of data analysis that sometimes fall through the cracks in traditional statistics classes and textbooks. The book is useful as a companion to introductory courses in data science or data analysis. It is also a useful reference tool for people tasked with reading and critiquing data analyses.", "Description: If you are a programmer interested in learning a bit about data mining you might be interested in a beginner\u2019s hands-on guide as a first step.
