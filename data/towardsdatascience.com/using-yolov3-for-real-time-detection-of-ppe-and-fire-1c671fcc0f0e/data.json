We live our daily lives around skyscrapers, malls, and warehouses. Most of the time we are clueless about what it takes to construct these buildings. The construction industry is responsible for creating such magnificent masterpieces. With $1.3 trillion annual expenditure (~6.3% of the GDP) [1] and 7.6 million employees (~5% of the total workforce) [2] as of March 2020, construction is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy. However, it is also considered as one of the most hazardous industries due to the high construction site fatalities.", "The top cause of construction related casualties are falls, people getting stuck in the equipment, electrocution and collisions . The majority of these injuries can be prevented if workers wear appropriate personal protective equipment like hard hats, safety vests, gloves, safety goggles, and steel toe boots.To ensure safety at the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE).", "Currently the PPE detection technique can be classified into two types: sensor based and vision based. The sensor based approach uses RFID (Radio Frequency Identification RFID) tags and requires a signi\ufb01cant investment in purchasing, installing, and maintaining complicated sensor networks. On the contrary, vision-based approaches use cameras to record images or videos of the construction site, which are then analyzed to verify PPE compliance. This approach provides richer information about the scene that can be utilized to understand complex construction sites more promptly, precisely, and comprehensively.", "This article explains how a deep learning model built on YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) architecture can be used to meet various safety requirements like PPE compliance of construction site workers and fire detection using minimal hardware i.e. a surveillance camera. The deep learning algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and veri\ufb01es PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In today\u2019s world, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is most widely used for image classi\ufb01cation and object detection, due to its ability to self-learn from large sets of annotated training data.", "Any object detection problem in computer vision can be defined as identifying an object (a.k.a., classi\ufb01cation) in an image and then precisely estimating its location(a.k.a., localization) within the image. Object Detection is used almost everywhere these days. The use cases are endless, be it tracking objects, video surveillance, pedestrian detection, anomaly detection, self-driving cars or face detection.", "There are three main object detection algorithms that are currently used in the industry:", "An R-CNN \ufb01rst identi\ufb01es several regions of interest, and then uses a CNN to classify those regions to detect objects in them. Since the original R-CNN is slow, faster variants of it, e.g. Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN have been proposed. In R-CNN, the image is first divided into approximately 2000 region recommendations (region propotals) and then CNN (ConvNet) is applied for each region respectively.", "The size of the regions is determined and the correct region is inserted into the artificial neural network. The biggest problem of this method is time. Since each region in the picture is applied CNN separately, training time is approximately 84 hours and forecast time is approximately 47 sec.", "Most of the object detection algorithms use regions to localize the object within the image. The network does not look at the complete image. Instead, they look at parts of the image which have high probabilities of containing the object. YOLO or You Only Look Once is an object detection algorithm much different from the region based algorithms seen above. In YOLO, a single convolutional network predicts the bounding boxes and the class probabilities for these boxes.", "The strategy used by YOLO is radically different from earlier detection systems. A single neural network is applied to the whole image. This network splits the picture into regions and calculates bounding boxes for each area and probabilities. Those bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.", "SSD is a popular algorithm in object detection. It\u2019s generally faster than Faster RCNN. SSD discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. [4]", "Now, we will see how we collected data for this project and the implementation of YOLOv3.", "In this project, we first classified the objects that we are detecting into four categories: Helmet (Person wearing helmet), Person( Person without helmet), Fire and Safety vest.", "Training data set are images collected as samples and annotated for training deep neural networks. We collected images for our data set from multiple sources like the safety helmet data set that can be found on github, images from google and Flickr and annotating them using labelIMg. Also, for getting custom data with these objects, we used the Flickr API & downloaded the images using python code. For labelling the image, we used the LabelImg tool.", "LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool. It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface. For object detection, there are many formats for preparing and annotating your data set for training. The image annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet. It also supports YOLO format we have used this format and the annotation are saved in below format in a text file.", "<x> / <y> corresponds to the centre in the corresponding axis of the bounding box", "<width>/ <height> corresponds to the width & height of the bounding box", "You can refer to this article https://medium.com/deepquestai/object-detection-training-preparing-your-custom-dataset-6248679f0d1d to get a comprehensive overview of how to use this tool for annotating your custom data set.", "To avoid false predictions while collecting the data for fire images, we made sure that we include various orientations, backgrounds and angles of every object to train our model better. For example, we have included images of setting sun will null annotation to avoid it being misidentified as fire.", "Here is a link for our data set that contains images for a person with helmet, a person without helmet, fire and safety vest.", "One of the biggest advantages of using YOLO over other detection systems is that its predictions are informed by the global context of the entire image at the time of testing. It also makes predictions with a single-network evaluation, unlike classifier based systems such as the R-CNN. YOLO works more than 1000x faster than R-CNN and over a 100x faster than Fast R-CNN. [10]", "The version we have used for our project is YOLOv3. YOLO currently has 4 versions: v1, v2, v3 and v4. There have been incremental improvements to each version. The most notable improvements in v3, that we have used, are in class prediction and feature extraction. For class prediction, YOLOv3 does not use softmax as it assumes that each \u201cbox\u201d can only have one class, which is not often true. Instead, the researchers used independent logistic classifiers. For feature extraction, they use a network with 53 convolutional layers \u2014 called Darknet-53.[11]", "We are using Darknet implementation of YOLO", "Please refer to the paper on \u201cDeep learning for site safety: Real-time detection of personal protective equipment\u201d to better understand the YOLOv3 working.", "2. Three anchor boxes are connected to each of the three output layers, resulting in a total of nine anchor boxes.[12]", "3. The output-1 layer refers to the three biggest anchor boxes (to detect large objects), the output-2 layer is attached to the next three biggest anchor boxes (to detect medium sized objects), and the Output-3 layer is associated with the three smallest anchor boxes (to detect small objects).[12]", "4. In the training process, each grid cell in the output layers takes appropriate anchor boxes and learns how to move and/or scale these anchor boxes in such a way that the changed boxes (a.k.a., bounding boxes) perfectly \ufb01t the objects of interest, as illustrated in Fig..[12]", "5. Each predicted bounding box is associated with a (N +5)-dimensional vector.[12]", "In the above vector tx, ty, tw and th represent x- and y-coordinates of the center, and the width and height of the box, respectively.", "6. The value p0 (a.k.a., objectness score) is the probability of the subject/object within the boundary frame. The remaining values are N conditional probabilities, P(Ci|object), each indicating that given an object present inside the box what is the probability that it belongs to class Ci, where i = 1,\u2026, N.[12]", "8. To avoid inconsistency and replication in the inference part, YOLO uses the non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique to eliminate boxes with higher percentage of overlapping but with lower confidence levels, thus ensuring the preservation of a single bounding box for a given item.[12]", "A common metric to measure the performance of object detection algorithm is intersection over union(a.k.a. IoU). As shown in image below, IoU represents the percentage of overlap between two boxes, e.g., the ground-truth box (G) and the predicted box (P), and is calculated using equation given below:[12]", "In the image shown below we can see that the bounding box in white represents the ground truth and the bounding box in red represents prediction. The difference in the ground truth and prediction is used to get the mean average precision for our model.", "AP (Average precision) is the most widely used metric in measuring the accuracy of object detectors like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3 etc. Average precision computes the average precision value for recall value over 0 to 1.", "Below image shows our prediction results on our entire data set. We have obtained Mean Average precision of 77.58%", "We tested our trained model on a video that has people wearing helmets, safety vest and there is also a scene with fire in it.", "If you are interested in the code for the implementation of YOLOv3 on our custom data set, please use the below link to access it.", "A project by Aastha Goyal, Harshit Nainwani, Rishi Dhaka, Rupali Roy and Shweta Shambhavi for the Data Science Laboratory course EE 460J at UT Austin.
