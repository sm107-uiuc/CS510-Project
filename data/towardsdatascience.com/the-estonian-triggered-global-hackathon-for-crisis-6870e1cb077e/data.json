Nearly half of humanity is under lockdown \u2014 blocked from physical movements, borders closed, schools locked, entire sectors of businesses basically shut down, health-care systems in country after country have become overwhelmed with exponentially exploding numbers of patients in critical conditions. But we are online without borders. So, what do you do in this situation? Well, the Estonian way is, of course, to set up a global hackathon of 1 000 000+ people.", "The Global Hack will be held on April 9\u201312th, and the aim of the hackathon is no more or less than to change the world as we know it, and the more there will be people who contribute to it, the more the benefit for the entire global community.", "There has been a lot happening around due to the pandemic and I won\u2019t burden you with another summary of sad statistics that you can get updates about from lots of different sources. What I\u2019d like to give an overview of, is the certain thread of prelude to the corona crisis from Estonia \u2014 a story of how Estonia became from a country where 20 years ago people even didn\u2019t know what the word \u201cstart-up\u201d means, to a country of most startups per capita in Europe, and now triggered a snowball of events that, within just last couple of weeks, has led to local hackathons in more than 40 countries, participated already by more than 100K people, and aimed to culminate in the global hack with more than 1M+ people in April.", "20 years ago, literally, very few people in Estonia even knew that such a word as \u201cstart-up\u201d even exists. Consider this: the entire population of Estonia is 1.3 million. It is not possible to determine the exact track record, but it is estimated that there were only 5 startup investments in total in 2006 in Estonia, with the estimated amount of total capital raised in those deals about 5.7 million euros. By 2019, the same according numbers have grown to about 300 million euros and 74 deals per year.", "The whole history in numbers looks like this:", "The most notable event that triggered the public awareness about startups was the emergence of Skype, which was co-founded by a Swedish, Danish and Estonian people, and which engineering team was based in Tallinn, Estonia. It was especially interesting in the sense that, while Estonia didn\u2019t have any notable startup culture yet, then we suddenly\u2026 BOOM!\u2026 had a unicorn in our backyard.", "For those who don\u2019t remember, Skype was initially branded as \u201cThe P2P VoIP client developed by the authors of Kazaa\u201d. That Kazaa, a P2P file sharing platform, was a cool story on it\u2019s own. You can read some documented history about it from the Wikipedia article for example, if interested, but here it is enough to say that Kazaa managed to generate quite an amount of fuzz so that when the authors of it started Skype, it immediately became a hockey-stick growth hit, because the public perception by the early adopters back then was that if it is done by the creators of Kazaa, it must be good.", "Skype was a seemingly crazy freak accident in more than one way. It wasn\u2019t just a unicorn that suddenly came out of nowhere in a country without any pre-existing startup culture, but it also did it\u2019s unicorn exit extremely fast \u2014 it took only 2 years for Skype to get from being founded in 2003 to the $4.1 billion exit to eBay in September 2005. And another 6 years to $8.5 billion acquisition by Microsoft. I personally worked in Skype during that eBay acquisition time, from January 2005 to November 2007, initially as a back-end developer, building a machine learning pipeline to fight off credit card fraud, and later building up Skype for Mobile engineering team from 0 to about 40 people before I left to chase the other challenges.", "That experience of having nothing heard about startups to the sudden unicorn-in-the-backyard moment had an epic impact to the young tech community. In Silicon Valley there have been huge deals happening every other week, but Estonia was still having the history of the totalitarian communist Soviet regime fresh in the memory (just regained the independence 15 years ago back then), the salary levels were still low, far from any reasonable western standards. That moment of eBay Skype acquisition felt to Skype early employees with stock options quarterly vesting like money has suddenly started raining. The whole story of Skype and those events was widely followed in Estonian public media and the awareness about startups as a concept in general got a strong primer boost.", "Couple of things happened quite immediately after the Skype exit that set the wheels of the soon-to-become startup nation into motion. Firstly, the Estonian Skype co-founders formed an investment vehicle, called Ambient Sound Investments (ASI), to start doing angel investments in Estonia and its neighborhood. I personally happened to advise on the tech due diligence process of their investment pipeline, and also led one startup project conceived in their incubator type of experiment. Due to those involvements I saw another important pivotal thing happen. Namely, people from ASI established a weekly morning coffee event for its portfolio companies to get together face-to-face, exchange experiences, train pitching, get feedback etc. At some point that club-like gathering extended outside of ASI portfolio companies and the Estonian Startup Leaders Club was formed.", "It didn\u2019t take long after that until some of the most active people from the Startup Leaders Club founded another movement, called Garage48, which is a 48-hour hackathon series on its own. That happened in early 2010 when the first Hackathon was held. My personal involvement was both at organizing the event, but also as a part of one competing team (managed to generate real revenues already in the first 20 hours). Later, more and more events were created and the series has become a huge success with the format being exported to lots of different countries, even as far as Africa. You can see the history of all events held from here.", "Initially, when we started this series, our expectations were humble in the sense that we didn\u2019t necessarily expect the actual startups starting to emerge from these hackathons. The whole idea was more like just get the people together, create the experience and attitude of getting things done, have the like-minded people find each-other and perhaps co-found something real later, after the event and the experience got from there. However, every now and then real startups emerged as an added bonus, and some really cool stories among those as well. For example, a project called MSQRD, which was a winner at Minsk (the capital of Belarus) event in 2015, got acquired by Facebook just 3 months later, with the deal size estimated at $40 million.", "From early on, the country has been keeping delivering good teams. Take September 2011, SeedCamp intro day, seeing 4 strong Estonian teams among 20 final contenders. Dave McClure from 500 Startups Accelerator back then, coined the now ever-living Twitter hashtag #EstonianMaffia, with that tweet.", "Even the President of Estonia back then (2006\u20132016), Toomas Hendrik Ilves, boasted about #EstonianMafia on Twitter. He was a really cool president, he is really tech-savvy and understands stuff, he is a great fan of startups and made regular visits to companies. When he visited our Mooncascade office I learned he has even written assembler in the past during his university studies. We had him sit at one of our engineers\u2019 computers and write a couple of lines of code. Which was to deliver a surprise message to our customer in Seattle, TUNE.com, with a personal greeting \u201cGreetings to Seattle from Tartu. I used to live there and worked as a forestfire fighter at the Enumclaw U.S. Forest Service office\u201d.", "The list of top companies by funding in Estonia currently is following:", "Examples of Estonian rooted startups that have been acquired or made an IPO are Skype, PlayTech, ZeroTurnaround, GrabCAD, PlanetOS, Teleport, VitalFields, Ecofleet, etc. Examples of local sources where Estonian startups could get funding are EstBAN (business angels network), Startup Wise Quys (an accelerator), Karma.vc (a VC fund), SuperAngel Fund, Contriber Ventures, crowd funding (Funderbeam, Fundwise), etc. The examples of the startup related events in Estonia are Latitude59, sTARTUp Day, Garage48, Mobile Monday, etc.", "As soon as the coronavirus spreaded into Europe and Estonia, people from Garage48, AccelerateEstonia, and the whole Estonian startup community immediately reacted and created the first hackathon of its series by online means, with multiple goals in mind. Firstly the goal being to find ways to cope with the escalating crisis, but also to prove to each-other and set an example, that such an event can be organized by only online means and at an even greater scale. The event was held on March 13\u201315th, just 2 weeks ago.", "Now, the same format events have been popping up all over the world, to help solve the issues for their communities. The map of which can be seen here. And the culmination of which is going to be the Global Hack with the aim to fight the unprecedented global crisis that we are currently living through, globally.", "There are lots of people from lots of different teams that have been putting a monumental effort into preparing the event. I really admire the persistence and hardship of the people making it all happen. I am happy that our team from Mooncascade has donated the building of the website for the Global Hack. A longer (although probably still not comprehensive) list of people who make this happen is acknowledged in this Facebook post.", "Machine learning engineer, entrepreneur, nerd.
