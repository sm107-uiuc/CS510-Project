What you can do with the data is deriving insightful information regarding:", "You can use a variety of Business Strategy and Statistics tool to extract information from your data, however, AI allows you to perform two kinds of specific analysis:", "Let us assume you have distributed the following survey. Each person has to answer 5 different questions with a score from 1 to 10.", "Essentially, a low-resolution version of this dataset translates into:", "If we want to apply Unsupervised Learning algorithms to this dataset to find out additional information, we can perform both a Factor and a Cluster Analysis. First of all, let us not confuse the terminology, among beginner data scientists this difference is not always known.", "Cluster Analysis is used to understand the different kinds of customers. The analysis is performed on samples and has the objective to group them into clusters. Given our initial example, you may find two different kinds of clusters:", "If you divide your entire list of customers into clusters (or segments), you will have a better understanding of:", "Factor Analysis is a bit more complex than Cluster Analysis because it is less intuitive.", "If you want to access the code that has been used to simulate this explanation, download it from my repository.", "Practically, we can use this tool to make sense of the many questions written in our survey. If, for instance, each person has to answer 20 questions (they might be 100 like they might be 1000), how can we interpret the data?", "Very simply, we see how questions covary so that we can group them together based on common factors.", "For example, in my survey, I ask:", "Are those different questions? No, essentially they are the same question, and if you look at all the answers they are almost identical: they have a correlation of 0.9863, which is almost perfect.", "If we decide to measure how strong the variables move together, we just need to calculate their correlation coefficient. We can immediately group them into two separate columns: we call them Factors. Because the dataset is simple, I can obtain this result just looking at a correlation matrix, in reality, it is much more difficult, and the procedure is much more tedious and approximate.", "After performing a factor analysis we can identify:", "We can simplify our survey by simply using 2 factors that we can name:", "As you can see, all the information we have been asking customers makes much more sense now.", "Factor Analysis has been commonly used to make a sense of indicators and measurements. Factor Analysis techniques have been used to extract:", "AI has already started having an impact on marketing and advertising. Since the availability of Big Data, you can reach exclusively potential customers withing your market niche. A good example is targeted advertising on Social Media: but to exploit it, you need to know what to search.", "No, as long as you have access to data you can gather any kind of information from your customers. Collecting data in big volume is expensive, but under a threshold it is even downloadable for free. For example, open-source studies on people\u2019s personalities or customer satisfaction in regards to certain products will save you a lot of money.", "You can always choose to download the data yourself connecting to DataBases and use AI tools, but a good amount of work is already accessible for free on the internet, in websites such a Kaggle or GitHub.", "In reality, these statistical tools have been present for a long time. However, their barriers to entry are much lower now. If years ago you needed a team of experts to perform the necessary analysis, now any open-source machine learning tool operated by a single engineer can output the same results for a much lower price.", "Every high performing company (not only the Big Techs) make their market analysis, but they also rely on their data when they can.
