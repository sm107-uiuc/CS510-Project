It was an excellent opportunity to meet leading AI researchers, thought leaders, and fellow practitioners.", "Now in its 3rd year, AI Summit is one of the most prestigious conferences focusing on enterprise AI applications. With 3,000+ attendees, 300+ speakers and 150+ sessions, the summit had something for everyone. All the usual suspects were in attendance, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and of course, Sophia the Robot (@RealSophiaRobot), Hanson Robotic\u2019s AI initiative. Even Financial Institutions were well represented by Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan, Citi, Capital One, Bank of America, and Barclays. The sessions were a good mix of case studies, business insights, and technical solutions from every industry sector. Here are 5 key takeaways from my experience at the summit.", "A couple of years back, AI was offered as a solution to every problem in the world. It was supposed to make the world a \u2018better\u2019 place so that we all can live happily ever after! This year, we heard about stories of AI failing miserably including the somber story of a self-driving car accident in Tempe, AZ, and hilarity of Amazon Alexa starting her own party in Munich, Germany.", "Another reality check is the realization that AI is only as good as the data that it can learn from. Speaker after speaker pointed out that \u2018AI Strategy\u2019 starts with \u2018Data Strategy\u2019 and we need to climb the \u2018AI pyramid\u2019 in the right order. This back-to-basics pivot showed that we are at the inflection point and ready to move beyond the early AI hype.", "The democratization of AI was one of the most prominent themes of the conference. Gone are the days when you need a Ph.D. to build a Machine Learning algorithm. With the emergence of cloud service providers, powerful algorithms are just a simple API call away. These solutions significantly lower the entry barrier for a much larger business community.", "\u201cAI is all about automating the ineffable\u201d \u2014 Cassie Kozyrkov, Google", "Cassie Kozyrkov (@quaesita) delivered an excellent keynote on how Google is democratizing AI through cloud computing and developing Decision Intelligence discipline. Other cloud service providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure showcased powerful solutions for taking advantage of off-the-shelf AI capabilities. Furthermore, Ben Goertzel (@bengoertzel) from SingularityNET championed \u2018Decentralized AI\u2019 for infusing AI and blockchain together to create an open market. It is an interesting proposal for ensuring the democratization of future AI development.", "Deep Learning has the reputation of being a \u2018black box\u2019 methodology but model interpretability is an active research field. Several success stories for building \u2018glass box\u2019 models were shared for improving transparency and interpretability. Here are a few interesting projects in the Explainable AI domain:", "The summit has a separate stream for \u2018AI in Finance\u2019 where speakers from global banks and fintechs discussed the latest trends in Finance. The key AI use cases include anomaly detection for fraud/compliance/cyber-defense, expert systems for robo-advisors and chat-bots/virtual agents for customer experience.", "\u201cWhen we think about AI/ML, its about removing the friction to give customers seamless experience\u201d \u2014 Gavin Michael, Citi", "Especially both Amazon Connect and Google Contact Center AI recently announced contact center AI solutions that promise better efficiency and lower operating costs. Experts agreed that manual back-office bank operations would likely be the target of AI investment in the near future.", "Last July, the two biggest personalities in Technology got into a very public dispute over the future of AI. Elon Musk believes that AI will be the downfall of the human race while Mark Zuckerburg thinks that AI will actually help innovate even further. The two fought over social media, trading petty remarks, but essentially both represent the opposite sides of the AI: Apocalypse vs. Nirvana. Regardless the business community has realized that general or \u2018human-like\u2019 intelligence is much farther away and focused its efforts on domain-specific impactful AI applications with tremendous job growth potential.", "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that AI is helping people at their jobs\u2026 as well as opening up new jobs\u201d \u2014 Beth Smith, IBM Watson", "Especially, the \u2018Responsible AI\u2019 theme transcended through every talk. Several speakers talked about integrating \u2018trust\u2019 as one of the engineering principles and embedding ethics and values as a part of AI deliverables.", "\u201cWe need to create responsible AI so we can bring trust to the technology\u201d \u2014 David Carmona, Microsoft", "IBM has created AIFairness360, an open-source toolkit to mitigate unwanted bias in the Machine Learning models and Adversarial Robustness Toolbox for analysis of attacks and defense methods for machine learning models. New York City recently passed the first bill to examine \u2018algorithmic bias\u2019 in government agencies. Responsible AI will likely be the focus of technological, sociological and political discussions for the foreseeable future.", "Overall this was an amazing learning experience with great talks, demos, and panel discussion. I truly enjoyed interacting with fellow AI professionals and was able to forge valuable connections within the industry. Thank you AI Summit (@Business_AI #AISummit) for putting together a phenomenal conference!", "Your home for data science.
