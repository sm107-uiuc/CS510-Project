A study published in 2018 revealed that companies across the board collect and maintain location data to some degree. Only a few of them, however, can leverage that valuable information for decision-making, either because they do not know how to use them in their business decisions or they do not have the right technical capacity to analyze geospatial data. Things are changing rapidly, every industry is now taking location data more seriously for a wide range of applications.", "When we say \u201clocation data\u201d in the age of smartphones and GPS, people tend to think of them as data generated by cellphones and navigation devices. Instead, what I\u2019m here referring to is the location of static objects and events. An example of static objects is every Starbucks store located in the US, while the location of events can be places where all the car accidents took place in a city. Such location data is used \u2014 often in combination with other datasets \u2014 for a wide variety of applications as we will see below.", "Not a single sector in public service or business you can find where location data is not useful. Below are just a few examples of many of those application cases.", "Analyzing location data is a well-established branch of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) \u2014 known as \u201cpoint pattern analysis (PPA)\u201d. PPA is nothing but the analysis of the spatial arrangement of data points (latitude/longitude) in two-dimensional space. Just like statistical data analysis, in PPA location data is analyzed using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. Once you plot geographical coordinates of the objects and events, a variety of EDA can be done to answering specific questions or test hypotheses. Most common techniques to analyze location data are the following:", "Centrography measures basic descriptive statistics of location data, such as central tendency (e.g. mean center), dispersion (e.g. standard deviational ellipse) and spatial variance and it tells us how data are clustered or dispersed in space.", "Generally speaking, density means the number of observations per unit area. For example, if there are 20 coffee shops in 4 square miles of the city area then we will say that the city has 5 shops/sq mile. This is a simple method to calculate density, but \u201ckernel density\u201d is probably the most well known of all for density analysis.", "Density is tremendously valuable in understanding the hotspots of observations. It is also used as inputs to further analysis for data-driven decisions (e.g. number of traffic police to be deployed given a hotspot of car accidents).", "In density-based techniques the distribution of data points is presented relative to the study area. In contrast, distance-based methods show how data points are distributed in space relative to each other. There are a few techniques to do that:", "There is more than just measuring spatial statistics of data points. You could do many additional analyses such as spatial correlation analysis of how observations (e.g. crime location) are related to underlying co-variates (e.g. population density) and how they change over time etc. There is a whole lot of ways to work with point data with sophisticated models such as Poisson Models, but I\u2019m shelving this for another discussion.", "Now that we know what location data are, what purpose they serve and how to analyze them, here is a quick tour of how you can create an interactive map to visualize location data in just a few lines of code.", "The data has just two columns \u2014 longitude and latitude \u2014 representing the location of some randomly selected crime events in Montgomery County, MD. You can find and download the data from the official spatial data repository.", "Once you learn the basics of spatial statistics and how to handle relevant libraries, points data analysis is as interesting as it can get. In future posts I\u2019ll delve into practical applications with real-world datasets, so stay connected.", "And finally, stay strong everyone, take care of yourself, your family. Extraordinary time calls for extraordinary measures, hopefully, we\u2019ll get past this situation soon.", "Your home for data science.
