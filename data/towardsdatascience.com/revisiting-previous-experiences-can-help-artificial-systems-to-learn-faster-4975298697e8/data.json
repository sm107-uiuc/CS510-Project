In [1], Nils J. Nilsson describes this next level as:", "\u201c[\u2026] general-purpose, educable systems that can learn and be taught to perform any of the thousands of jobs that humans can perform.\u201d", "The reason for RL being a good candidate to achieve such a goal is simple: its reward-based learning mechanism is close to the mechanism used by the human brain for learning things. RL agents learn by trial and error- how to behave to maximize the received reward (one can think of a dog receiving treats from its owner/trainer).", "Despite its potential, classical RL approaches show many limitations and, even being able to solve numerous complex problems, are far from achieving this general-purpose long-term goal.", "In the search for improvement, many researchers propose biologically-inspired methods that extend RL. The method described below consists of using stored memories in an efficient way to speed up learning.", "Studies in the neuroscience field support that memories containing prior episodes of experiences are replayed in the hippocampus of rodents, an occurrence observed in different levels of brain activity.", "The results also show that experiences which resulted in some level of reward are more frequently replayed. Even more interesting is that the sense of novelty is also associated with the probability of replaying some experience, as described in [2]:", "\u201c[\u2026] we have identified dopaminergic release during, for example, novel environments and reward-driven spatial tasks, as being important for biasing the content of subsequently replaying trajectories, potentially to strengthen new place cell assemblies and place-reward associations.\u201d", "This means that learning also happens by revisiting old experiences and some mechanism is used to choose the better experiences for optimizing the learning process, e.g. choosing experiences that present some degree of novelty or are associated with received rewards.", "To mimic this experience mechanism present in biological systems, the method called Experience Replay was proposed in [3], alongside learning action models for planning, and teaching. These three extension methods are suggested to speed up learning of both AHC (adaptive heuristic critic) and Q-learning algorithms. The motivation to apply Experience Replay is:", "\u201cThe basic AHC- and Q-learning algorithms [\u2026] are inefficient in that experiences obtained by trial-and-error are utilized to adjust the networks only once and then thrown away. This is wasteful, since some experiences may be rare and some (such as those involving damages) costly to obtain. Experiences should be reused in an effective way.\u201d", "The assumption is that storing and processing previous experiences is \u201ccheaper\u201d than interacting with the environment.", "Experience is defined as a quadruple, (s, a, s\u2019, r), meaning that the execution of an action a in a state s results in a new state s\u2019 and reward r. While interacting with the environment, the agent remembers (by sampling) its past experiences to learn more from them.", "Two main problems that are mitigated by applying Experience Replay are:", "The introduction of Experience Replay was already a big improvement for RL. However, biological evidence supports that some experiences are more frequently replayed than others.", "In [4], PER, an improved version of the Experience Replay method, is presented. The main idea is to use TD error as a metric to define the probability of replaying some experience.", "TD error represents the prediction error (the difference between the model output and the received reward) for a given state and is frequently used as a prioritization mechanism (e.g. artificial curiosity [5] and feature selection [6]).", "The motivation is that, similar to biological systems, experiences from which the learning system can learn more (i.e. states associated with large TD errors) should be replayed more frequently, speeding up the learning process.", "The results in [4] showed that applying PER on an agent supposed to learn how to play Atari games allowed to speed up learning by a factor of 2.", "Another interesting result given in [4] is that this same method can be applied to improve supervised learning methods. The method, renamed as Prioritized Sampling, consists in using more frequently the examples that represent a higher error for focusing the optimization (learning) process:", "\u201cThe analogous approach to prioritized replay in the contextof supervised learning is to sample non-uniformly from the dataset, each sample using a priority based on its last-seen error. This can help focus the learning on those samples that can still be learned from, devoting additional resources to the (hard) boundary cases\u201d", "That method can be beneficial especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets, because examples containing less-represented classes will have a higher sampling priority, provided they still result in a large prediction error.", "When applied to a class-imbalanced variant of the classical MNIST digit classification problem, prioritized sampling is proven to result in an increase of performance in terms of generalization and in terms of learning speed.", "Your home for data science.
