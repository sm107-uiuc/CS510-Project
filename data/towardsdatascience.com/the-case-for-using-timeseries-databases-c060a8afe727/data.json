From in-memory key-value stores to graph databases, from geospatial databases to time-series databases. All of these different types of databases serve a specific use where the general solution of using a relational database isn\u2019t very efficient.", "Although there are a lot of different types of databases, here we\u2019re going to look at time-series databases \u2014 the databases required to handle time-series data.", "Data that consists of successive measurements of something over a time interval is time series data.", "With the modernization of financial trading and IoT's advent, the need for time-series databases is evident. Stock and cryptocurrency prices change every second. To measure this changing data and to perform analysis on that data, we need an efficient way of storing and retrieving data.", "With the unprecedented penetration of IoT devices in our lives, the data generated by IoT devices is increasing every day. Be it the diagnostics of your car, the temperature readings from your house, the GPS location of your dog who got lost, IoT devices are everywhere.", "IoT devices are made to do one thing and one thing only. Capture information through sensors on the device and send it to the server for storage. As the existing communication protocols were too complex for this kind of lightweight, high-frequency data, streaming data, MQTT was developed to solve messaging for IoT.", "Timeseries data can be of two types \u2014 regular (usually measurement-based) and irregular (usually event-based).", "But time-series data is not limited to IoT; it penetrates the whole of the internet too. Capturing trends on search engine queries, hashtags, the virality of social media posts, and so on also generate time-series data. It doesn\u2019t end there. Logging and auditing for security and compliance in a world driven by software are essential. All such data can also be categorized as time-series data.", "Timeseries databases are designed specifically to deal with the problems that arise from capturing, storing, and analyzing time-series data from one or more of the aforementioned sources. So, for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s define time-series data as data that has", "Given this information, a time-series database should be able to store a large amount of data with the capability of large-scale record scans, data analysis, and data lifecycle management. As mentioned earlier, traditional transactional databases, although you can use them to store, retrieve, and process time-series data, but that wouldn\u2019t make the best use of the resources available.", "Now, as companies have realized this fact, they have started using specialized databases for solving specific problems. This brings back to what I started this post talking about. Timeseries databases, amongst all other databases, have seen a higher adoption rate in the last 2 years (data as of December 2020).", "The main reasons for this ~2.5 times hike in the usage of time-series databases can be attributed to the convergence of cloud & data technologies along with the ability to capture data from places where it wasn\u2019t common to capture data from earlier, i.e., the engine of a car, your refrigerator, location data of billions of devices, and so on. Apart from the new sources, companies have also realized that some of the older sources weren\u2019t really suited for transactional databases after all. All of this has contributed to the wider adoption of time-series databases.", "With the existence of time-series databases justified, let\u2019s look into what are the different options you can go for if you want to try out time-series databases. A fuller list of time-series databases can be found on the DB-engines website. I\u2019ll talk about three of them.", "Marketed as PostgreSQL for Time-series, it catches your attention really quickly. PostgreSQL for anything is a compliment, by default. With new architectural constructs like hypertables and chunks, TimescaleDB boasts over 15x improvements in inserts and a substantial improvement in query performance. Read more about that here.", "Although there are no fully integrated solutions for TimescaleDB in the cloud with major cloud providers, just like most other time-series databases, TimescaleDB can be run seamlessly on all of them. For instance, if your infrastructure is in AWS and you don\u2019t want to run your TimescaleDB instance in Timescale Cloud, you can either use EC2 instances to install an official TimescaleDB AMI, or you can use the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Services using the official helm charts.", "In the following video, Mike Freedman is talking about the need for time-series databases and how they architected TimescaleDB around PostgreSQL.", "Unlike TimescaleDB, which had its inspiration in PostgreSQL \u2014 a relational database, this one is a NoSQL time-series database written from scratch. While TimescaleDB had the advantage of standing on the shoulders of widely accepted and admired relational databases, InfluxDB took a different path. InfluxDB is one of the top time-series databases but, according to TimescaleDB\u2019s study, it fails to beat TimescaleDB in a number of areas.", "If you are up for an interesting read and want to install both these databases on your system to find out for yourself, head over to this interesting comparison published just today by Oleksander Bausk on his blog.", "Having said that, InfluxDB has a great set of features. Apart from the query languages InfluxQL and Flux, InfluxDB has also developed a clean, lightweight, text-based protocol that is used to write points to the database. To their credit, this has seen adoption from other time-series databases like QuestDB.", "Like TimescaleDB, InfluxDB also offers a cloud solution out of the box, but you can still decide to run InfluxDB on one of the cloud platforms. For instance, if you run it on AWS, you\u2019ll have native support for CloudWatch metrics, Grafana, RDS, Kinesis, and so on. All in all, a very good database. As it is fairly new, it is hard to tell how well it will compete with the more relational database-based time-series databases.", "A recent addition to the list of time-series databases, QuestDB has come out of one of the latest batches of YCombinator. Some of the main differentiators for QuestDB are columnar storage, low memory footprint, the use of the relational model for time-series, and scalable schemaless ingestion. Similar to most time-series databases, QuestDB also offers cloud deployment options on AWS using official AMIs and Kubernetes Helm Charts.", "QuestDB has also adopted InfluxDB Line Protocol for ingestion without worrying about changing the schema with the changing structure of data. Being a columnar database, QuestDB handles the creation of new columns seamlessly, and hence, supports schemaless ingestion. I recently wrote about that in another post.", "Although in its early days, with almost full ANSI SQL support along with some additions to the SQL dialect, QuestDB has created a bunch of completely unique features that make it a viable alternative, possibly better than some of the other major databases available in the market.", "Although there are several other databases, I\u2019ve only talked about these three for now. The shift to time-series databases for time-series data is evident from publicly available data. More and more companies will start using time-series databases as part of their database stack, not necessarily replacing relational databases, but adding to their data capabilities. This is the reason why this year will be particularly exciting for not just time-series databases but all other specialized databases coming up in the market.", "Your home for data science.
