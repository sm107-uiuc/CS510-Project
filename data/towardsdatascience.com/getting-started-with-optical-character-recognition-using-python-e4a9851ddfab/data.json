The 2-Dimensional text data can be obtained from various sources such as scanned documents like PDF files, images with text data in formats such as .png or .jpeg, signposts like traffic posts, or any other images with any form of textual data. There is a wide range of interesting applications for optical character recognition.", "The first time I came across optical character recognition was in my school days where our answer scripts with multiple choice type questions (MCQ\u2019s) would be analyzed by these devices. The data extraction from these answer scripts could be done and the answers would be marked according to the answer key. Uhm, albeit a majority of people used to always complain that the result they got was not the one they desired. This could have been due to the fault/ incompetence of the device or the students perhaps were slightly misleading. However, with modern technologies, optical character recognition is used in a variety of applications and they are much more advanced. The accuracy of these devices has vastly improved.", "In this article, we will cover the basics of optical character recognition. Then, we will proceed to install the pytesseract module which we will be using for performing the optical character recognition. Initially, the installation was quite annoying and troublesome for me when I was getting started. So, I will try to simplify the steps for the installation process. We will then understand the various functions in the pytesseract module using python. Finally, we will end it with a code snippet covering the use of the optical character recognition alongside the google text to speech module combined.", "Note: The final code will be a combined code using both the text to speech and character recognition. This is the second part of the language model designing series. If you have no clue about the gTTS module, I would highly recommend the viewers to check out the below link. In the next part of this series, we will try to combine speech translation and optical character recognition with deep learning. To view this series in the order of your preference you can click the link here.", "The optical character recognition process flow is demonstrated in the above block diagram. An API request is sent for the OCR operation to be performed. The input image is read and pre-processed accordingly. The text is formatted and extracted from the image. Using the trained dataset the image sent into the OCR engine is computed. The OCR engine tries to analyze the characters in the image and find the appropriate solutions. Once the engine finishes the analysis, it sends the data for another step of pre-processing and formatting to exclude any unnecessary items. Once This process is completed we will finally have the text data required. After this, an API response can be generated back to the user with the converted text data from the image.", "The installation might be a bit tricky. However, I will try to simplify the steps for installation so that you can get started as soon as possible. The first step is simple, you just install the pytesseract module using the pip command. Type the following command in the command prompt terminal/virtual environment \u2014", "We have successfully installed the pytesseract module but when you try to run the code right away you will receive an error message which states that the tesseract module is not installed in your system. For this step to be completed, visit this site. This is the official site for windows tesseract. The installer for Windows for Tesseract 3.05, Tesseract 4, and development version 5.00 Alpha are available from Tesseract at UB Mannheim. These include the training tools. Both 32-bit and 64-bit installers are available.", "Choose the Installation of your preference and install it accordingly. You can add the pytesseract module to your path or just use it directly. I hope this solves most of the issues for the installation process. If you have any other queries feel free to let me know.", "Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google\u2019s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.", "To understand this more intuitively let us look at the following simple code block \u2014", "We import the pytesseract module and specify the path. We then read the image using the cv2 module. Finally we extract these images and return the text data. The image_to_string Returns the result of a Tesseract OCR run on the image to string. For more information on the tesseract OCR and its functions like image_to_string visit here.", "This section will contain the final code snippet combining both text to speech and optical character recognition. We will be using the recently installed pytesseract module alongside modules like gTTS and PIL. PIL stands for python imaging library which will be used for loading our images. The open-cv module cv2 can also be used for reading images. Let us look at how the entire code works in 3 parts.", "In this code block, we are importing the required libraries and specifying the path to the Tesseract location. We will then proceed to read the image with the cv2 module. You can also use the PIL library for this. The command would be \u201cImage.open()\u201d. After this step, we will use the OCR library for the conversion of image into text data and print the required output.", "In this next code block, we are formatting the text data to get it one single line. We are basically performing pre-processing on the already obtained text data before passing it into the gTTS module for the process of speech translation.", "Finally, we will import the Google text-to-speech module and convert the text data in the form of an audio message. This is extremely useful for hearing a vocal audio for text data in PDF\u2019s as well as images. If you are having any confusion related to the gTTS module, then refer to one of my previous articles to understand this concept better.", "We have covered some of the concepts of optical character recognition with an intuitive understanding of how exactly OCR process flow works. I hope the installation procedure to get started with OCR technology with python was simplified and all of you could achieve the desired results. We understood a few functions of the pytesseract module and finally wrote a code combining both the gTTS and pytesseract module.", "In the next part of this topic language model designing, we will look into how we can use deep learning technologies as well as OCR and TTS (text-to-speech) to develop a cool project.", "I would highly recommend all of you to check out the below references for grasping the concepts and learning them better. Let me know if you have any queries and have a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Love to explore and learn new concepts.
