But can R\u2019s dplyr beat Python\u2019s pandas in the data exploration and preparation domain? Yes, it can.", "Today we\u2019ll see how to use 10 of the most common dplyr functions. That\u2019s not all the package has to offer, so refer to this link for a complete list. We\u2019ll perform the entire analysis with the Gapminder dataset, available directly in R.", "Here\u2019s how to import all the packages we\u2019ll need today:", "Let\u2019s begin the exploration from the next section.", "The select command is used when we want to, well, select one or multiple columns. Think of it as a SELECT statement in SQL, where we can pick only columns of interest, and leave others untouched.", "This is the first way of using select \u2013 by listing all the columns we want to keep:", "The other method is by specifying columns we want to remove \u2014 done with the - prefix:", "The filter command is equivalent to the WHERE keyword in SQL, as we can fetch only the subset we\u2019re interested in.

The %in% operator comes in handy here:", "The arrange operator is used to sort the data by individual columns, either in ascending or descending order. The ascending ordering is the default. It is equivalent to the ORDER BY keyword in SQL.", "Let\u2019s sort the Gapminder dataset by population in ascending order:", "Let\u2019s do the same in descending order:", "This operator is used to find unique elements of a given attribute.

Let\u2019s discuss those next.", "We can use grouping operators to utilize the full potential of previously discussed operators, such as summarize. This one is equivalent to the GROUP_BY keyword in SQL, so you\u2019re probably already familiar with it.", "Suppose we want to find the average life expectancy per continent \u2014 impossible to do without a grouping operator:", "We can chain multiple operators together, and perform groupings on multiple columns. For example, let\u2019s see how to find an average life expectancy per continent, grouped further by years (only 2002 and 2007):", "This is not your traditional operator, as we use it inside other operators, such as mutate. It lets us perform a vectorized if-else statement without writing multiple lines of code.", "Let\u2019s see how we can group by continent and year (only 2002 and 2007) and calculate the average life expectancy, and then create another column which has the value of \u2018Y\u2019 if the average life expectancy is greater than 70, and \u2019N\u2019 otherwise:", "At the end of the day, anything done in dplyr can be done in pandas.
