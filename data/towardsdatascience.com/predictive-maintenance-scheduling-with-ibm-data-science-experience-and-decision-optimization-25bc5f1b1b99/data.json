It can be extremely costly due to extended production downtimes. Not only do they result in high urgency repairs and investment in new machinery and parts, but unexpected production loss may affect supplier obligation and force a company to purchase products from its competitors, resulting in significant unanticipated costs. According to Automation.com (2016), up to $20 billion is lost annually due to unplanned repairs.", "Predictive maintenance uses predictive analytics and machine learning (ML) to determine the lifespan of a machine and the likelihood of it failing on a given day. The idea is to use this information to schedule maintenance before equipment fails but not before it is actually needed, avoiding unnecessary costs associated with repair and production loss (Figure 1). Depending on the industry, the type of assets can vary from cars and trucks to wind turbines, cranes, and oil platforms.", "It is important to notice that predictive maintenance offers real advantages over preventive maintenance, which uses a fixed cycle for replacement and repair, often based on vendor specification. The latter doesn\u2019t take into account the actual state of the machine or the specific environment where it operates, for example production levels or other operating conditions. Therefore, preventive maintenance is often inaccurate and results in excessive costs due to repairs being scheduled too late or too early. Predictive maintenance, on the other hand, can take into account historical data in order to more accurately predict the likelihood of failure.", "A machine learning model can take into account all available information, such as sensor data, historical tasks and orders, past failure history, and maintenance history. As a result, it can help determine the optimal maintenance day for each machine based on its specific characteristics (Figure 2).", "This methodology works great when we consider one machine at a time and there aren\u2019t conflicting priorities. However, once we start introducing some complexity, dependencies, and limited resources, determining the optimal schedule becomes more challenging. For example, what if planned production happens to be highest on the day that we predict to be optimal for maintenance (Figure 3)? In this case, scheduling repairs a day early may end up being less costly as this way we can avoid peak production loss.", "More importantly, how do we deal with limited resources? If our ML model predicts that Day 3 is the optimal maintenance day for three machines (Figure 4), but only two maintenance crews are available, what should we do?", "While machine learning can take into account all available data and past history to predict the likelihood of failure for a given machine, decision optimization (DO) can take it a step further and generate a schedule that is optimal for a set of machines, subject to limited resources (e.g. maintenance crew availability), other constraints and dependencies (production plan and repair costs), and optimization metrics (minimizing total cost, maximizing customer satisfaction/meeting planned production, minimizing late maintenance). Not only does it offer us valuable insights, but it also generates an actionable schedule or plan (Figure 5).", "As is the case with any business solution, it is not enough to create a model. Our ultimate goal should be a solution delivered in the hands of business users and decision makers. This is true no matter what technology is being used, and the methodology will be similar. Here, as an example, we outline how IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CPD), the IBM Data and AI platform, can be used to build a predictive maintenance scheduling solution. The key steps are the following (Figure 6):", "Step 0: Gather all required data, including historical information on the machines and failure rates. Build and deploy a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of failure on a given day. In IBM Cloud Pak for Data this can be done in a variety of ways, including using AutoAI to select and tune the best model automatically, a model in Python or R using an open-source package such as scikit-learn, or using SPSS Modeler\u2019s graphical user interface. Once the model has been trained, validated, and tested, it can be deployed as an online model to be accessed using REST APIs. The remaining steps focus on implementing and deploying an optimization model and a web application:", "Let\u2019s take a look at the first three steps in more detail.", "The key elements of a decision optimization model are optimization metrics, constraints, and decision variables.", "Optimization metrics define what we are optimizing for (minimizing/ maximizing). In case of predictive maintenance these metrics could be any one or a combination of the following:", "The optimization model will need to take into account a number of constraints, including:", "Finally, the decisions that need to be made (modeled as decision variables) determine the day/time when each machine is scheduled for maintenance. These values are not part of our input data, and will instead be automatically determined by the optimization engine as part of the solution.", "Decision Optimization dashboards display inputs and outputs of our DO model. The input tab may look something like this:", "Here we see some data on machines and their characteristics, planned production levels by day, predicted failure (output of the ML model), and maintenance cost. Of particular interest is the predicted failure chart which may give some clues as to when it makes sense to schedule maintenance. Let\u2019s say we wanted to use a heuristic and schedule \u201cright before it gets too red\u201d, meaning the day before the machine is very likely to fail. We will treat this as our \u201cManual\u201d scenario and define maintenance events as follows (checkmark indicates a maintenance event):", "We also define an \u201cOptimized\u201d scenario with no fixed maintenance events and let the optimization engine determine the schedule automatically. After solving the two scenarios, we can compare the solutions side-by-side in the multi-scenario tab of the Dashboard:", "Clearly the optimized scenario results in lower total cost and less production shortage. Looking at the maintenance schedule, it is easy to see that the optimal maintenance days aren\u2019t obvious as in some cases it is better to schedule maintenance several days earlier and in other cases even one day late (machine 6). The optimized scenario also makes better use of resources \u2014 one maintenance crew required as compared to two in the \u201cManual\u201d scenario. The benefits of optimization are easy to see, even on a very small problem (6 machines, 15 days, and small number of constraints). Imagine how much more difficult it would be to find a good solution when a problem is large (hundreds/thousands of machines and large number and type of constraints)!", "Once the model is ready, tested, and the scenarios have been reviewed by business decision makers, it is ready to be deployed online, and all that\u2019s left to do is developing and deploying our web application. Our demo was implemented using a simple Node.js app.", "The latest data on machines, production levels, and maintenance costs is loaded in a separate data tab for reference, if needed:", "Under the main \u201cMaintenance Planning\u201d tab we connect to the ML executable service to obtain predictions. The top of each curve tells us when each machine is most likely to fail:", "We are now ready to invoke the optimization service and generate the optimal maintenance schedule in one click of a button:", "Now that we have obtained the optimal maintenance schedule, we can easily fix some maintenance events manually (equivalent to the \u201cManual\u201d scenario in the Cloud Pak for Data DO Dashboard, discussed above) by creating a new scenario and specifying the events:", "Solving the scenario one more time and comparing the results to the original one confirms that the optimal solution is better than the manual one (cost of $2,279 vs $2,471):", "Of course, this is just a simple example of a demo implemented using IBM Cloud Pak for Data, Decision Optimization, and Node.js. The possibilities are infinite as far as what you can do and how you can present information in your own app.", "Predictive maintenance scheduling is a key area in many asset intensive industries. Creating an optimal maintenance schedule is a challenging problem that is best tackled using the combined power of machine learning and decision optimization. While machine learning can take into account all available data and past history to predict the likelihood of failure for each machine, decision optimization can take it a step further and generate a schedule that is optimal for a set of machines, subject to limited resources, other constraints and dependencies, and optimization metrics. Not only does optimization offer valuable insights but it also generates an actionable schedule or plan.", "The benefits of using a good predictive maintenance solution can be significant and include but are not limited to:", "According to a study by the World Economic Forum and Accenture, the business value of a predictive maintenance solution is:", "If your company is looking for better ways to optimize maintenance scheduling or solve other predictive and optimization challenges, please do not hesitate to reach out for help.
