Sklearn has not only changed the entire language and ecosystem for Python, but also machine-learning as a whole. According to HugoVk, who cites his sources as", "(you can view his site here)", "Scikit-Learn is the 62nd most downloaded Python package through Pip. That might not sound that significant, until you factor in that Python in the first place certainly wasn\u2019t built for machine-learning, and that is precisely what Sklearn is built for. For comparison, Numpy, the Python package typically associated with linear algebra in Python is ranked number 23. Pandas, the go-to package for managing copious amounts of data in data-frames is number 38. IPython falls short of Sklearn, coming in at number 76. This effectively means that more people have downloaded Sklearn than have used Jupyter Notebooks with Python. This statement is likely disproved though, whenever one thing is taken into account:", "Sklearn was originally created as a \u201c Google Summer Of Code\u201d project by David Cournapeau under the New Berkeley Software Distribution License in June of 2007. The name Scikit stems from the combination of two terms,", "A kit for Scipy is self-explanatory, but it\u2019s very clear that Sklearn has grown far beyond just being a toolkit for Scipy. This was done by an entire A-list of developers in 2010, Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel, all from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation.", "It\u2019s no secret that in recent years the popular portions of the Python ecosystem have changed dramatically, and all of this is due in part to Cournapeau\u2019s \u201c Summer Of Code\u201d project. The impact that Sklearn\u2019s fantastic code-base has had on the Python programming language as a whole is immeasurable. Sklearn, as well as Google\u2019s open-source machine-learning library, Tensorflow, worked to create a dominant and forceful ecosystem inside of the Python language that has yet to be significantly challenged since. Even in the much newer language, Julia, packages often PyCall Sklearn in order to get certain jobs done.", "Machine-learning is the hottest pieces of technology in Python right now, as well as in the entire world. And with a world that\u2019s advancing towards automation, it\u2019s both exciting and stunning that Python has become the dominant force driving this new expansion. The Python programming language itself has made numerous updates to quell the suggestions of machine-learning engineers alone. It\u2019s hard to argue with the prospect of machine-learning both enhancing, and shaping the entire language to fit its needs.", "If you\u2019ve been working in the Data Science field for a while, you\u2019d have to have no eyes and ears to not have noticed that other modules have taken inspiration directly from Sklearn. In fact, there is an entire concept when writing Python machine-learning modules called", "Most machine-learning modules, even including Tensorflow are created with this methodology in mind. Model \u201c fitting\u201d has become an entire definition on its own, and this is all thanks to the wonderful work done on SkLearn. The entire Data-Science ecosystem revolves around the well-developed, and venerable tools contained inside SkLearn. Not only that, but an ever-expanding number of machine-learning algorithms deployed all across the HTTP protocol also depend on SkLearn.", "It was touched upon that SkLearn was far less popular than Numpy in terms of user downloads through Pip, but another one that was placed far above SkLearn was Scipy. Scipy is probably the biggest dependency of Sklearn, hence the reason the name was based off of being precisely that. SkLearn made these tools even more of household names in Data Science than they already portrayed.", "The popularity of Pandas and Numpy are likely very correlated, or in Data Scientist lingo;", "\u201c Would return a very low P value\u201d", "and SkLearn and Scipy are a direct analogy to those two packages. SkLearn was built with Scipy in mind just as Pandas was built with Numpy in mind. SkLearn changed the Python ecosystem entirely by making Scipy a much more popular package just by being a dependency.", "Needless to say, SkLearn has certainly left its mark on machine-learning, Python, Computer Science, as well as automation, and it\u2019s very unlikely that it will be going anywhere anytime soon. SkLearn is the only lone machine-learning package on the top one-hundred Python packages, and ranks pretty significantly when the numbers are put into perspective.", "Not only has SkLearn influenced the way that models are written, but it has also covered new ground in Python for machine-learning, sculpting the language as well as the ecosystem to revolve around it, to some extent at least. All of this makes SkLearn\u2019s impact on Science, machine-learning, and automation extremely exquisite and significant. SkLearn is a module that begun its life as a project orchestrated together by Google.", "As with many open-source packages, the wonderful community of open-source programmers and GNU fanatics were able to make it much more than it ever could have become as a proprietary solution. All of the hard work that the maintainers put in for years afterward has really payed off, and made Python machine-learning a staple in the Python programming language, and I sincerely hope that never changes.", "Your home for data science.
