Wylder\u2019s deaf.", "Yeah well, he didn\u2019t register anything on the hearing scale, even when they were playing a noise as loud as a jet taking off in his ears.", "We\u2019ve got more testing coming up, if he\u2019s eligible he\u2019ll be getting Cochlear Implants to assist with hearing. But they\u2019re unsure yet.", "Dave is my best friend. Wylder is his son. He was born unable to hear. The Doctor said, \u201cA 1 in 100,000 chance.\u201d", "I knew I couldn\u2019t do much except listen. Feeling helpless is not a good feeling.", "A few weeks later, we were at Wylder\u2019s Switch On. An event where he would have his Cochlear Implants switched on for the first time enabling him to hear. He\u2019d passed all the tests and was a prime candidate for the devices.", "When they came on the lady played three sounds. One high, one midrange and one low. She tracked Wylder\u2019s response to each of them. \u201cThe software will build in the gaps between.\u201d She said.", "There would be several subsequent appointments required to get the implants working at their full capabilities but for the first time, even if only slightly, Wylder could hear.", "The morning before the event I got up early and started the Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera. I wanted to know more. Had to know more. What\u2019s Bioinformatics? It\u2019s the crossover of biology and technology. Wikipedia adds a bit more depth.", "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data.", "Why Bioinformatics? I wanted to learn more about what was going on with Wylder. What\u2019s a cochlea? What caused it? Was it a gene? Which gene? Could what I knew about programming help?", "Why Coursera? Because it\u2019s where the foundation of a lot of my learning has begun over the past 2-years.", "The keyword is foundation. Courses and specialisations are great for this. But the real way knowledge grows is by tinkering, exploring, expanding, building upon these foundations.", "So I built my own project. One to explore the DNA. To find the genes involved in inner ear hair cell development. What did they do? The hair cells are what translate sound waves into electric signals the brain can interpret as sound. Could I use what I\u2019d been learning manipulating DNA with code in the Bioinformatics Specialization? Yes.", "But it turned out to be all wrong.", "Everything I did had no biological or scientific grounding. I made a video about it and someone in the comments said so. I already knew. I put a clause at the start of the video and one in the description saying so.", "What\u2019s the point if it was wrong?", "We\u2019ll get to that. Better to start with why first.", "When you started learning to ride a bike, you had training wheels on. You learned how to peddle, how to brake, how to move the handlebars.", "But you were missing something. The most important skill for riding a bike. Balance.", "It was only once the training wheels came off did you learn how to balance.", "I used the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization on Coursera to build a foundation of knowledge in data science. But I learned way more when I worked on building A Gentle Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis. It was wrong too. People who read it did their own research and told me. So I fixed it. And then there was another error someone else found. Every error I fixed, I learned something new. Something deeper. Something I didn\u2019t see before.", "Having a foundation of knowledge is important. Knowing how to peddle, how to brake and how to steer is important for riding a bike. But learning more about these things isn\u2019t going to help you when the training wheels come off.", "It\u2019s the same with courses. You can keep completing more courses, improving your foundation of knowledge (and you should) but don\u2019t mistake this for competency.", "Doing more courses on how to peddle better won\u2019t enable you to ride a bike.", "Only once you take your training wheels off do you learn to ride.", "That\u2019s how the best projects start out.", "When you go on a journey, it\u2019s nice to have a compass and a map. But what if you only had to choose one? Which is more important?", "Because a map only has a set number of paths. A compass can be used in an unlimited number of ways.", "That\u2019s how you can structure your own projects. Start with a direction you want to head in. A thought, an idea. That\u2019s your compass.", "Planning out the steps you\u2019ll take is valuable but don\u2019t let it hold back exploration.", "No great project ever started with someone knowing the exact path they were going to take in advance. If you already knew how it was going to work out, you\u2019d get bored. A known future is already the past.", "Here\u2019s where the remixing of ideas comes in. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been learning about data science and machine learning. You\u2019ve done some courses but now you\u2019re looking for more.", "It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll ever be the best at one thing. You can try but remember, competition is fierce. A better option is to be the best at the crossover. The crossover of two things, three things, four things. Not too many though, otherwise the quality will start to decline.", "How does this relate to projects?", "You can take the foundation of knowledge you\u2019ve been building through courses and combine it with the research you\u2019ve done on mental health. How can you use data to show others insights into the world of mental health?", "If you\u2019re a musician you can use machine learning to construct a new song out of the old recording tapes you have.", "The examples are endless but the formula stays the same. Whatever your interests, health, art, technology, science, finance, engineering, weather, where\u2019s the crossover?", "Get something wrong on the test and it used to come back with a red cross saying you\u2019re wrong next to it.", "School reinforces avoiding being wrong. Life encourages it.", "This doesn\u2019t mean you should have the goal of being wrong. But when you\u2019re starting on new work of your own. A project which might not work, give yourself permission to be wrong.", "Because being wrong will adjust your compass. It\u2019s a learning opportunity. Now you know where not to go.", "My next project will be better because my last one had mistakes in it.", "I\u2019m going to work on this for four weeks.", "That\u2019s what you could say. One hour per day for four weeks is a good amount of time.", "You can adjust the numbers to suit your needs. But having a deadline gives you something to work towards.", "My brother and I were at the cafe. He started speaking.", "I\u2019ve been looking at this course.", "He showed me. I read through it. I spoke.", "But you\u2019ve already done all these things? The foundations, you\u2019ve done, the advanced data structures you\u2019ve done, the publishing your own project, you\u2019ve done. What are you looking to get out of it?", "I\u2019m not sure I think it would help to learn more.", "How about you build a small app a month? Call it App a Month and share a story about each one.", "Yeah you\u2019re right, week one could be design, week two planning and prototyping, same with week three, then publish in week four.", "His eyes were on fire with ideas. I smiled. Then spoke.", "You may not be able to control whether your project amounts to be everything you imagine but dedicating a set amount of time and effort is something you can.", "There will always be interruptions. Life happens. When it does, take care of it and return to your project with the timeline in mind.", "You\u2019ve picked something which might not work, you\u2019ve used the crossover rule. You started when you weren\u2019t quite ready. And you\u2019ve stuck to your timeline.", "Ship it. Share what you\u2019ve done.", "Now others can critique your work, show you where you\u2019re wrong, show you where you\u2019re right, help you get better, that\u2019s what you\u2019re after, isn\u2019t it?", "The next time someone asks what you\u2019ve been working on, you\u2019ve got a story.", "I started working on a bioinformatics project, I didn\u2019t know how it would turn out but I had an idea in mind. I wanted to see if I could combine what I\u2019d been learning in the Bioinformatics Speciailzation on Coursera to my best friends son. He was born deaf so I looked into what genes cause hearing loss in infants. I found the ATOH1 gene. It\u2019s responsible for triggering hair cell growth in the ear. Hair cells are what convert soundwaves to electric signals. It took me about a month of research and building but when I had something I made a video about it and published my code online. I realised none of what I\u2019d found was biologically or scientifically sound. Someone pointed it out to me. But now I know where I\u2019d go next. I\u2019m hooked.", "My bioinformatics project was wrong. But I learned something. I learned what to do next.", "My Exploratory Data Analysis tutorial had errors in it.
