The repository is located here. When you\u2019re cloning, it\u2019s important to choose a folder that will be easy to find on the path. Something like C:\\dev\\vcpkg. From a command prompt you would do this:", "Once you\u2019ve cloned the repository into a local folder, change into that folder and issue the following command to build the executable (vcpkg.exe):", "Now you\u2019ve built the executable you can use it to integrate vcpkg into your build environment (such as Visual Studio 2019). From the command line do this:", "Let\u2019s say you want to install OpenCV4 on your computer so you can integrate it into your C++ programs. You would do something like this:", "The triplet describes the architecture and environment you want to install the package for. If this is the first package you have installed, vcpkg will download and install a compatible cmake which it will then use to build packages. Once it\u2019s done that it will then work out all the dependencies for opencv4 and build them first. Finally it will build the opencv4 package and store it in the package cache. Once you\u2019ve installed a package you can then use it within your C+ projects.", "Creating your own package is quite straightforward. I\u2019m going to give an example here of one I created for the TensforFlow C API (see https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) using the pre-packaged files created by the TensorFlow team. From a command prompt do the following:", "Here you\u2019ve given your package the name tensorflow-c-gpu and told it where to download the zip file from and what you\u2019ll call it locally. Issuing this command will create a cmake file that is used to build your package. In our example this file will be ports\\tensorflow-c-gpu\\tensorflow-c-gpu.cmake. Every package also needs a metadata file called vcpkg.json. This needs to be created in the same folder as the cmake file. To start editing these files you can issue this command from a command prompt:", "For our example the vcpkg.json file would look like this:", "You should also edit the cmake file that was created to use the zip file that is downloaded and put it into the right places. Here\u2019s what my tensorflow-c-gpu.cmake file looks like:", "You can see from this file that this package only support x64 builds on Windows. But that\u2019s all I need for now \ud83d\ude42", "Let\u2019s create a console app that uses this package. In Visual Studio create a C++ Console App. I\u2019ve called mine TfConsole.

It should 2.3.0.", "I think the vcpkg manager from Microsoft is a great package manager and more and more packages are being added to it. I\u2019ve also shown you here how to add your own, which can be quite straightforward once you know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m planning on doing a series of articles about using Machine Learning models in production in a Windows environment. It will cover a Windows front end (it will be a WPF C# desktop app) using various different backends. One of the backends will be using the tensorflow C API \u2014 which turns out to be pretty hardcore as there\u2019s no documentation on it and very few examples of usage! But it\u2019s also super quick (it does inference quicker than my Python code).", "Your home for data science.
