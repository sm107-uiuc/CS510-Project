Since then, I have received requests to update the progress of the stock portfolio I have especially during this pandemic time.", "Thankfully, as my current master semester is ending and I slowly built up good Work From Home (WFH) habits. I had time to re-evaluate my personal stock portfolio and update it especially during the tough moments of coronavirus pandemics. This pandemic will be a stress test to see how my portfolio performs.", "Disclaimer: This analysis is conducted at 10th of April, which is not the trough of the stock market during corona virus pandemic declaration in early March. I am not a finance professional and have never worked in investment setups. Instead, I am a data practitioner trying to analyse and communicate ideas to solve problems and bring impacts. All of the portfolios and stock purchases I made is purely for my own personal benefit and evaluation for my own value investing tool and methodology.", "This portfolio analysis includes my latest purchase of oil during the trough (when coronavirus is marked as a pandemic \u2014 13/3/2020). However, surprisingly, if you focus on my old purchase during 2017 and 2018. I still received huge 75.87% stocks gain from Keppel DC Reits for and 41.61% for Qualcomm. I bought these stocks after Bitcoin Crash and Apple Lawsuits respectively.", "I am surprised that my portfolio still performs well despite the entire Corona Virus pandemics in the stocks market. The number shows that it was the right move for me to purchase strong stocks within the right margin of safety (15%) with a conservative discounted rate and risk calculation.", "When you buy strong stocks at cheap price, you have less to worry about the market", "On 11th March 2020, WHO declared the Corona Virus as Pandemic, which leads the oil stocks market to drop to 17 years low due to the existing pandemic and price competition set up by Saudi Arabia and Russia. This shows that there is so much fear about the pandemic to reduce the oil stock prices sharply. Feel free to find the dashboard I deployed here.", "Simply put, I think these are well established companies which will stay even 10 years in the future. Oil consumption will always be needed and there are no threats of comparable renewable sources of energy that are coming soon.", "In general, these are some warning signs and critical financial ratio for you to look at:", "Given list of the companies, find out the feasibility to investBeen in market minimal 10 yearsHave the track records (EPS per year)Have efficiency (ROE > 15%) \u2014 Net income / shareholder equityDetermine manipulation (ROA > 7%) \u2014 Net income / Total AssetHave small long term debt (Long term debt <5* total income)Low Debt to EquityAbility to pay interest: (Interest Coverage Ratio >3) \u2014 EBIT / Interest expenses", "There are many reasons for the fear during the trough of oil prices, but I believe the fear is not going to last in the long run:", "Due to the low price for the strong stock, I decided to put some reserves of my cash into oil, so far I have received 11.69% stock gain in CVX and 16.47% stock gain in XOM, only time knows what the exact total payoff is after the economy fully recovers.", "I believe strong investments are necessary for every household to make informed decisions about their finances. In this tough pandemic where people are laid off, the stakes are very high to have a personal portfolio. Hopefully, this article could be a starting point for you to think about investing from a quantitative and qualitative point of view.", "I personally enjoyed looking at the numbers and formulating stories that come from the numbers. Furthermore, investing is a good practice for me as a data practitioner to practice my skills and arms of trades in analytics and storytelling. Asmoth Damodaran, NYU professor teaching valuation, talks about such importance in his book. Furthermore, feel free to take a look at my basic tutorial here.", "I hope to release these updates every month after I do my stocks portfolio housekeeping.

They gave me a lot of feedback to understand technical jargon and common problems for households to invest. As a new Grad looking to invest my income, they were the right persons for me to learn from.", "Please Comment out below for suggestions and feedback.
