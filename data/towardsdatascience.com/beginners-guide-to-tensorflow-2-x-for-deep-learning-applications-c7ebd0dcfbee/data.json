Compared to other models, artificial neural networks require an extra set of technical skills and conceptual knowledge.", "The most important of these technical skills is the ability to use a deep learning framework. A good deep learning framework speeds up the development process and provides efficient data processing, visualization, and deployment tools. When it comes to choosing a deep learning framework, as of 2020, you only have two viable options :", "Well, we can compare TensorFlow an PyTorch for days, but this post is not about framework benchmarking. This post is about what you can achieve with TensorFlow.", "TensorFlow is an end-to-end framework and platform designed to build and train machine learning models, especially deep learning models. It was developed by Google and released as an open-source platform in 2015.", "The two programming languages with stable and official TensorFlow APIs are Python and C. Besides, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Swift are other programming languages where developers may find limited-to-extensive TensorFlow compatibility. Most developers end up using Python since Python has compelling data libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.", "There are several advantages of using a powerful deep learning framework, and the non-exhaustive list below points out to some of them:", "Currently, we are using the second major version of TensorFlow: TensorFlow 2.x. It took almost nine years to achieve this level of maturity. However, I can say that we are still in the beginning phase of the ultimate deep learning platform because the current trends indicate that deep learning processes will be much more streamlined in the future. Some claims that API based practices will be the standard way of using deep learning and artificial neural networks. But, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves and take a look at the history of the TensorFlow platform:", "I \u2014 In 2011, Google Brain developed a proprietary machine learning library for internal Google use, called DistBelief. DistBelief was primarily used for Google\u2019s core businesses, such as Google Search and Google Ads.", "I \u2014 In 2015, to speed up the advancements in artificial intelligence, Google decided to release TensorFlow as an open-source library. Tensorflow Beta was released.", "I \u2014 In 2016, Google announced Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Tensors are the building bricks of TensorFlow applications, and as the name suggests, TPUs are specially designed ASICs for deep learning operations.", "I \u2014 In February, TensorFlow 1.0 was released, setting a milestone. Before February 2017, TensorFlow was still in 0.x.x versions, the initial development process. In general, version 1.0.0 defines the public API with a stable production capability.Therefore, February 2017 was indeed a big milestone for TensorFlow.", "I \u2014 Seeing the rapid advancements in mobile technologies, the TensorFlow team announced TensorFlow Lite, a library for machine learning development in mobile devices, in May 2017.", "I \u2014 Finally, in December 2017, Google introduced KubeFlow. Kubeflow is an open-source platform that allows operation and deployment of TensorFlow models on Kubernetes.

This strategy was adopted because PyTorch has attracted many researchers with eager execution.", "As you can see, TensorFlow is much more than a deep learning library for Python. It is an end-to-end platform that you can process your data, build & train machine learning models, serve the trained models across different devices with different programming languages. Below you can see the current diagram of the TensorFlow platform:", "As of 2020, the real competition is taking place between TensorFlow and PyTorch. Due to its maturity, extensive support in multiple programming languages, popularity in the job market, extensive community support, and supporting technologies, TensorFlow currently has the upper hand.", "In 2018, Jeff Hale developed a power ranking for the deep learning frameworks in the market. He weighs the mentions found in the online job listings, the relevant articles and the blog posts, and on GitHub. Since 2018, PyTorch has achieved an upward momentum, and I believe it must have a higher score by now. But, I believe TensorFlow still has superiority over PyTorch due to its maturity.", "You have come to this point, and I hope you already developed an understanding of what TensorFlow is and how you can benefit from it. If you are convinced to learn TensorFlow, in the next posts, I will explain the topics below with actual code examples:", "The second post is already published:", "You can follow my account and subscribe to my newsletter:", "Over the years, TensorFlow turned into a big platform covering every need of machine learning experts from head to toe.
