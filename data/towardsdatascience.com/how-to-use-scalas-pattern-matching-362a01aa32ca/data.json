Now, we have a scanner that is able to classify fruits. If we were to write the program using Scala\u2019s pattern matching, it would look like this.", "If you have a variable named fruit and the value assigned to it is apple, then the above pattern matching statement will print received an apple. to your console. And so on.", "When the value of fruit is neither apple, banana, strawberry nor blueberry, then the statement will print unable to classify this fruit. is it really a fruit? to the console.", "Now, if you were to write an if-else statement for this, it would be something like.", "In my opinion, the pattern matching expression is much more readable than the if-else counterpart, but hey, it really depends on your preference. At the end of the day, both the above statements do the same thing.", "Besides matching against the value of an object itself, we can also match against possible types (or case class).", "Let\u2019s say we are writing a classification program for a computer scanner at a fresh produce department of a supermarket. The scanner will label an item based on its type, e.g. fruit or vegetable. I\u2019d imagine this is how we would define our trait and case classes.", "Now, we are going to write a function that will take a GroceryItem object as its input and classify whether it is a Fruit or a Vegetable. This is how it would be written in its simplest form.", "Notice the syntax _: Fruit. This is how we should write our case when we want to pattern match against its instance type. Additionally, this expression does not actually look into the value of the case class\u2019 field (e.g. name).", "If we want to also match against the field of the case class, this is how we can do it (look at the first case expression).", "Please note that the order of the case expressions matters. In the above case, if the additional case Fruit(name) expression is placed after case _: Fruit, the code will never ever reach it as it will match the case _: Fruit right away.", "From this example, we also learn that we can add an if statement on the case statement. I find that this is useful in some cases.", "In Scala, we may have an object that is of the Option type, which simply means we may or may not have a value.", "Let\u2019s say we have a function that scans the supermarket\u2019s inventory for an item by its name and returns the quantity if the item is found.", "We can use the pattern matching to handle an Option object. Let\u2019s write a function that will process the output of the findItemAndReturnQuantity function.", "Before we end this section, I want to show you a simple tip. In some cases, such as this Option object, the compiler knows what the possible outcomes are. So, as you type the pattern matching expression, you should see that the following suggestion comes up.", "If you select the match (exhaustive), it will automatically populate both the cases where the value exists and where it doesn\u2019t.", "Remember that we can also add if statement to the above expression if we need to. For example, we want to inform our staff when the quantity of an item is low in stock.", "By the time you reach this section, you will have learnt the basics of Scala\u2019s pattern matching. You should be able to use it now in your code or to replace some of your existing multilines if-else statements.", "If you program in Kotlin as well, like I do, you might want to check out this tutorial on Kotlin\u2019s when statement.
