This is the question all the businesses like insurance, banking, pharma, industrial, construction, have to answer.", "The effectiveness of data management in the organization has a direct impact on organizational performance and better tactical and strategic planning.", "This article describes the evolution of the fundamental approaches to data in business organizations and the latest trend \u2014 data mesh.", "Data warehouses are more than 40 years old. The idea is obvious, from today\u2019s perspective. Relational databases are well optimized for billions of short transactions that read and modify small chunks of data, but not for longer running analytical queries.", "A different storage and data engine was required and the data warehouse system was born.", "Data warehouses were traditionally optimized for the facts, with dimensions for a set of queries that were expected to be executed. A typical classic example is monthly sales reports, per branch in a given period of time.", "The most common data ingestion scenario for data warehouses is Extract-Transform-Load (ETL): Extracting data from source databases, Transforming it (cleansing, initial filtering and aggregations) and Loading it into the warehouse storage. Classic, isn\u2019t it?", "Data warehouses were created for a specific purpose and they served it well. The problem started when the business requirements changed significantly and the transformations, even in the early stages, started to hurt instead of help because they were optimized for different, now obsolete, business scenarios.", "If the domains were known well, and the analytical needs known well and were stable, then it\u2019s an effective approach. But the speed of business, more sources of non-relational data, and dynamically changing analytical needs were all accelerated by modern machine learning techniques.", "Also, data warehouses started to become a problem, with their strong schemas and resistance to change once they were filled with terabytes of data.", "Another issue was the fact that different business users groups, with their specific reporting and analytical needs, created their own warehouses with ETL mechanisms using different vendors and analytical systems. Data, both raw and transformed, were stored in different systems and as a result, data silos were created on different department levels.", "IT departments weren\u2019t comfortable with this at all. The need to have all the organization\u2019s data in one central location, managed by a central team, and in a raw unmodified format to enable any transformations later, which resulted in the popularity of data lakes.", "You can Extract, Load and then Transform (ELT) the data for your current and future analytical goals. Data lake provides data in a centralized location, from all the business domains and all the parts of the organization. Analysts can join and extract information from the data in ways that previously seemed impossible or too hard. Data is in a raw format so nothing is lost and no information is destroyed in the process.", "Consumers can decide how they want to benefit from data stored in the lake now and in the future. The IT department can add new sources of data and fill the data lake.", "Different views and access mechanisms are managed by the central team, so data, despite being in a single place, is protected from unauthorized access.", "Additionally, data streaming technologies enable real time reporting and constant ingestion into the data lake. And the proper design of data lakes enables cloud based tools to infer the schema from the data and run complex queries on top of them, we can think of these tools as semi-automated data warehouses but in modern, flexible versions.", "OK, we\u2019ve got all the data in one place, but what does this data mean? Storing data in one location doesn\u2019t make it more understandable. For instance, data grows exponentially. How do we deal with this flood of data without the proper understanding of which parts of the data matter, and which don\u2019t?", "Everything is stored \u201cjust in case\u201d \u2014 but what is the \u2018case\u2019?", "The raw format doesn\u2019t help either, because if the data consumer wants to do anything, the transformation for a more civilized format has to be performed by the data consumer, themselves.", "It\u2019s no longer a clean, structured and well defined data warehouse. Data engineers are often isolated from the business teams, and separated from business domains and knowledge about the data. Plus, all departments depend on a single team of data engineers.", "The need for a new way resulted in a data mesh pattern.", "Transactional systems evolved into microservices, but in the data area centralization dominates the landscape. Breaking monoliths of enterprise apps has become a new mantra, but what about data? A data lake can be seen as a data monolith. What about breaking it? What about applying domain driven architecture principles for data also?", "Data streams and sets are owned by users; it\u2019s raw data not operational data from source databases. It can be transformed to create a joint aggregate view of the business domain. Independent teams attached to business experts can now more deeply understand the meaning of the data in order to create better insights and predictions.", "Does this mean reversing the tide and bringing back the old problems? No \u2014 if it\u2019s done properly.", "Data as a product, means a product team, a product roadmap, proper management and development pipelines. From the users perspective, it means much better data discoverability, self-service (i.e., documentation, examples, schemas), and autonomy.", "A data platform, as a set of patterns, conventions, tools and infrastructure (i.e., storage, eventing, monitoring), has to be created to enable data users to focus on their goals and to help avoid unmaintainable data silos from the past. Data Experience for data scientists and business users plays a crucial role.", "From the IT perspective, the teams won\u2019t need to decide storage mechanisms. The distributed data ownership model doesn\u2019t mean separating data physically.", "It\u2019s the true beginning of data democratization, without losing IT governance.", "Data is separated in this approach, not centralized. How easy will it be to create data silos and lose the ability of combining data from different domains (again)? The solution is the proper standardization of data platform components and communication mechanisms.", "Technological challenges are here as well. In the microservices world, Kubernetes dominated the landscape and became the de facto standard, however in the data area it\u2019s much more fragmented and not as mature. It will take years to have a similar situation in data mesh, as we have now in the enterprise applications world.", "Data mesh, data lakes and data warehouses will continue to co-exist.", "The latest family of cloud data services enable for instance using existing data lakes and build modern semi-automated data warehouses on top of them, inferring the schema from the data and enabling complex queries capabilities.", "If your current data lake or data warehouse solutions are fulfilling your goals, it would be hard to justify an investment in migrating to data mesh architecture for your data needs. Some CIOs or CDOs even claim they have had data mesh architectures for years now, without using the new name.", "I\u2019ve also heard the voices of the proponents for the strict IT department control of data; they are reluctant to build such a platform in this paradigm.", "This time the traditional \u201cif it works \u2014 don\u2019t fix it\u201d attitude is the best tactic for the moment.", "However nothing stops us at Avenga from closely monitoring the trend and supporting tools, and experimenting with this approach in new areas in order to learn all about its full value.", "Your home for data science.
