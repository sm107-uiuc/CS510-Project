I mostly fancied this idea because I\u2019ve seen what Teslas are capable of, and while I didn\u2019t want to buy a Tesla right away (Model 3 is looking juicier with each passing day I gotta say), I thought I\u2019d try meeting my dream halfway.", "Below, I\u2019ve documented each step in the project. If you just want to see a video of the detector in action/the GitHub link, skip to the bottom.", "I started by thinking of what such a system should be capable of. If there\u2019s anything I learned during my life is starting small is always the best strategy: baby steps. So, apart from the obvious lane keeping task (which everyone has already done), I thought of just plainly identifying license plates as I was driving the car. This identifying process includes 2 steps:", "I thought that if I could do this, then moving on to other tasks should be rather easy (things like determining collision risks, distances, etc). Maybe even create a vector space representation of the environment \u2014 that would be dope.", "Before worrying too much about specifics, I know that I need:", "To start, I tackled building the right model for object detection.", "After careful research, I decided to go with the following machine-learning models:", "How would this trio of models work together? Well, here\u2019s the flow of operations:", "With my basic model architecture sketched out, I could move onto the hardware.", "Knowing that I need something low-powered made me think of my old love: the Raspberry Pi. It has enough compute power for preprocessing frames at a respectable framerate and it has the Pi Camera. The Pi Camera is the de-facto camera system for the Raspberry Pi. It has a really great library and it\u2019s very mature.", "As for internet access, I could just throw in an EC25-E for 4G access which also has a GPS module embedded in from one of my previous projects. Here\u2019s the article that talks about this shield.", "I decided to start with the enclosure. Hanging it on the car\u2019s rear-view mirror should work well, so I ended up designing a two-component support structure:", "These supports/enclosures would be printed with my trusty Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer.", "Figure 1 and Figure 2 show what the structures look like when they are rendered. Note that the C-Style holders are pluggable, so the enclosure for the Raspberry Pi and the suppport for the Pi Camera don\u2019t come with the holders already printed. They have a socket into which the holders are plugged in. This is very useful if one of my readers decides to replicate the project. They only have to adapt the holders to work on their car\u2019s rear-view mirror. Currently, the holders work well on my car: it\u2019s a Land Rover Freelander.", "Obviously, these took some time to be modeled \u2014 I needed a couple of iterations to get the structure sturdy. I used PETG material at a layer height of 200 microns. The PETG works well into the 80-90s (Celsius degrees) and is quite strong against UV radiation - not as good as ASA though, but strong.", "This has been designed in SolidWorks and so all of my SLDPRT/SLDASM files alongside all STLs and gcodes can be found here. Use them to print your version as well.", "Once I had the hardware, I moved on to training the models.", "As expected, it\u2019s better to not reinvent the wheel and reuse other people\u2019s work as much as possible. That\u2019s what transfer learning is all about \u2014 leveraging insights from other very large data sets. One very pertinent example of transfer learning is the one I read about in this article a couple of days ago. Somewhere in the middle it talks about a team affiliated with Harvard Medical School which was able to fine-tune a model to predict the \u201clong-term mortality, including noncancer death, from chest radiographs\u201d. They only had a small dataset of just 50,000 labeled images, but the pretrained model (Inception-v4) they used was trained on about 14 million images. It took them less than a fraction of what the original model took to train (both in time and money) and the accuracy they\u2019ve achieved was pretty high nevertheless.", "That\u2019s what I also intended on doing.", "I looked over the web for pretrained license plate models and there weren\u2019t as many as I have initially expected, but I found one trained on about 3600 images with license plates. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s also more than nothing and in addition to that, it was also trained on Darknet\u2019s pre-trained model. I could use that. Here\u2019s the guy\u2019s model.", "And since I already had a hardware system that could record, I decided to use mine to drive around the town for a few hours and collect frames to finetune the above guy\u2019s model.", "I used VOTT to annotate the collected frames (with license plates of course). I ended up creating a small dataset of 534 images with labeled bounding boxes for license plates. Here\u2019s the dataset.", "I then found this Keras implementation of the YOLOv3 net. I used it to train my dataset and then PRed my model to this repo so that others can use it as well. The mAP I got on the test set is 90%, which is really well given how small my dataset is.", "After countless tries to find a good kind of net to recognize text, I stumbled upon keras-ocr, which is a packaged and flexible version of CRAFT and CRNN. And it also comes with their pre-trained models. That\u2019s fantastic. I decided to not fine-tune the models and leave them as is.", "And above all, predicting text with keras-ocr is very simple. It's basically just a few lines of code. Checkout their homepage to see how it's done.", "There are two big approaches to model deployment I can go with:", "Both approaches come with their challenges. The first one implies having a big \u201cbrain\u201d computer system and that is complex and expensive. The second presents challenges around latency and infrastructure, in particular, using GPUs for inference.", "In my research, I stumbled upon an open source project called cortex. It\u2019s quite new to the game, but it certainly does make sense to be the next step in the evolution of development tools for AI.", "Basically, cortex is a platform for deploying machine learning models as production web services at the flick of a switch. What this means is that I can focus on my application and leave the rest to cortex to manage. In this case it does all the provisioning on AWS and the only thing I'd have to do is use template models to write my predictors. What is even more awesome is that I only have to write a few dozen lines for every model.", "Here\u2019s cortex in action in the terminal taken from their GitHub repo. If that ain't beautiful and simple, then I don't know what to call it then:", "Since this computer vision system isn\u2019t used by an autopilot, latency isn\u2019t as important for me, and I can go with cortex for this. If it were to be a part of an autopilot system, then using services provisioned through a cloud provider wouldn't have been such a good idea, at least not today.", "Deploying the ML models with cortex is only a matter of:", "Without getting into the gritty details of how I\u2019ve done it (and to keep the article to a respectable length), here\u2019s an example of a predictor for the classical iris dataset. The link to cortex\u2019s implementation of these 2 APIs can be found on their repository here \u2014 all other resources for this project are present at the end of this article.", "And then to make a prediction, you just use curl like this", "And a prediction response would look like this \"setosa\". Very simple!", "With cortex handling my deployments, I could move onto designing the client\u2014which was the tricky part.", "I thought of the following architecture:", "Here\u2019s a flowchart of the client in relation to the cloud APIs on AWS.", "The client in our case is the Raspberry Pi and the cloud APIs to which the inference requests are sent to is provisioned by cortex on AWS (Amazon Web Services).", "The source code for the client can also be inspected on its GitHub repository.", "One particular challenge which I had to overcome was the bandwidth on 4G. It\u2019s best to reduce the required bandwidth for this application to mitigate possible hangups or excessive use of the available data. I decided to go with a very low resolution on the Pi Camera: 480x270 (we can go with a small resolution because the field of view of the Pi Camera is very narrow so we can still easily identify license plates). Still, even at this resolution, the JPEG size of a frame is of about 100KB at 10MBits. Multiplying that by 30 frames per second gets us 3000KB which is about 24 Mb/s and that's without the HTTP overhead - that's a lot.", "Instead, I did the following tricks:", "The resulting frame has a size of about 7\u201310KB, which is exceptionally good. This translates to 2.8Mb/s. But with all the overhead, it\u2019s about 3.5Mb/s (including the response as well).", "For the crnn API, the cropped license plates don't take much at all, even without applying the compression trick. They are sitting at around 2-3KB a piece.", "All in all, to run this at 30FPS, the required bandwidth for the inference APIs is around 6Mb/s. That\u2019s a number I can live with.", "The one above is a real-time example of running the inference through cortex. I needed about 20 GPU-equipped instances to be able to run this smoothly. Depending on the latency with the cluster, you may need more or fewer instances. The average latency between the moment a frame is captured and then broadcasted to a browser window is of about 0.9 seconds, which is so fantastic considering that the inference takes place some place far away - this still amazes me.", "The text recognition part may not be the best, but it proves the point at least \u2014 it could be much more accurate by increasing the resolution of the video or by reducing the field of view of the camera or by fine-tuning it.", "As for the high GPU count, this can be reduced with optimizations. For example, converting the models to use mixed/full half precision (FP16/BFP16). Making the models use mixed precision will have a minimal impact on the accuracy, generally speaking, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trading off much.", "T4 and V100 GPUs have special tensor cores which are designed to be super fast on matrix multiplications on half precision types. The speedup of half precision over single precision operations on T4 is about 8x and on V100 is of 10x. That\u2019s an order of magnitude difference. This means that a model that has been converted to use single/mixed precision can take up to 8 times less time to do an inference, and respectively a tenth of a time on a V100.", "I haven\u2019t converted the models to use single/mixed precision because this is out of the scope of this project. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is only an optimization problem. I\u2019ll most likely do it the moment version 0.14 of cortex releases (with true multi-process support and queue-based autoscaling), so I can take advantage of the multi-processed web server as well.", "All in all, if all optimizations are brought into place, reducing the cluster\u2019s size from 20 GPU-equipped instances down to just one is actually feasible. If properly optimized, not even maxing out a single GPU-equipped instance gets possible.", "To make costs even more acceptable, using Elastic Inference on AWS could reduce these by up to 75%, which is a lot! You could have a pipeline for processing a stream in real time for a dime, figuratively speaking. Unfortunately, at the moment, Elastic Inference isn\u2019t supported on cortex, but I can see it being supported in the near future as it has already landed on their radar. See ticket cortexlabs/cortex/issues/618.", "Note: YOLOv3 and CRNN models and can be improved a lot by fine-tuning them on much larger datasets (of around 50\u2013100k samples). At that point even the frames\u2019 size can be further reduced to reduce the data usage without loosing to much accuracy: \u201ccompensate somewhere to be able to take from some other place\u201d. This, in conjunction with the conversion of all these models to use half-precision types (and possibly Elastic Inference as well) could make for a very efficient/cost-effective inference machine.", "With version 0.14 of cortex that has support for multi-process workers for the web server, I was able to reduce the number of GPU instances for the yolov3 API from 8 down to 2 and for the crnn API (which runs the inference on CRNN and CRAFT model) from 12 down to 10. This effectively means the total number of instances has been reduced by 40%, which is a very nice gain. All these instances are equipped with single T4 GPUs and 4 vCPUs each.", "I have found out the most compute-intensive model is the CRAFT model, which is built on top of the VGG-16 model that has about 138M weights. Keep in mind that multiple inferences are generally required for each frame because there can be multiple detected license plates in one shot. This dramatically increases the compute requirements for it. Theoretically, the CRAFT model should be eliminated and instead improve (fine-tune) the CRNN model to much better recognize license plates. This way, the crnn API could be scaled down a lot \u2014 down to just 1 or 2 instances.", "A couple of other things that could significantly improve the computational costs are:", "These improvements were discussed here, here, here or here.", "As for the AWS cluster costs incurred, here are my thoughts:", "I see devices starting to depend on cloud computing more and more, especially for edge devices which have limited computing power. And as 5G is being deployed at the moment, it should theoretically bring the cloud closer to these compute-restrained devices. Therefore, the cloud\u2019s influence should grow with it. The more reliable and ever-more present the 5G networks are, the more there\u2019s gonna be confidence in off-loading computation to the cloud for so called mission-critical tasks \u2014 think self-driving cars.", "One other thing I\u2019ve been learning with this project is how easy things have become with the advent of streamlined platforms for deploying machine learning models in the cloud. 5 years ago, this would have been quite a big challenge: but now, a single man can do so much in a relatively short period of time.", "Software/Hardware Engineer.
