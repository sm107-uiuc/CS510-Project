Data Science (loosely used as a term to encompass Business Intelligence, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, etc) is a relatively new industry to figure out how to extract value from this data.", "This article demonstrates there is a progressive learning to extract more and more information from the many sources of data.", "Converting this data into useful information is a journey.", "The Information Ladder shows that journey, starting from the simple, all the way to complex machine learning.", "In the workplace I often hear the words \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d used mistakenly. These are two distinct things, often confused for the same thing.", "In a world where many organisations are striving to become more data-driven, it is important to understand the distinction.", "Data is the raw material used to produce information.", "Information is a product of data; without data, there won\u2019t be information.", "Data comes in many shapes and sizes. Some data changes frequently, some is static.", "Frequently changing data includes website data; some websites have many clicks per second. Currency exchange rates are another good example, these fluctuate throughout the day.", "Static data would include the capital city of a country or the tenor of a bond.", "The explosion of the internet has led to a significant increase in data. I won\u2019t even attempt to quantify how much data, (others have), but everything that happens online is another data point. Every email, web click, like, video view, tweet, etc is stored somewhere.", "Gaining value from the data is a significant challenge. It takes time for organisations to become data-driven. It takes time to understand the data and it takes time to work out what to do with the data.", "Therefore, when starting on the journey to make an organisation more data-driven, it can be difficult to manage expectations.", "Climbing the Information Ladder is a journey.", "The lessons learned on each rung enable progression to the next.", "Each rung leads to a deeper understanding of the data. At the bottom rungs of the ladder, the data work is often simpler. Moving up the ladder often leads to more advanced data work and a larger amount of data sources. At the upper rungs, the data work becomes more complex.", "These are often the starting point of any business information. Usually table style reports, often someone getting data, putting it in Excel/Powerpoint and sending it around. Usually, this will be one or two data sources combined, keeping within the limits of basic Excel. Sometimes data is distributed in big Excel files and finding the information may take some work by the recipient, either scanning through a table or building pivot tables, etc.", "Like the above, only this time the user can drag and drop limited data sources to find information themselves. Or perhaps they ask their \u201cdata team\u201d to provide information on an ad-hoc basis. This is generally in the form of Excel. Often there are limitations to the data available. It\u2019s also prone to error as not all users may know the correct filters to apply / quirks of the data / etc to use effectively. The positive for the user is that getting answers, as long as the data is available, should be quite quick.", "A well designed dashboard should answer many business questions. Dashboards should provide the means for the user to answer their initial standard questions (i.e. how are the sales vs budget?) and also answer the follow on questions (i.e. which products are the top sellers? Which salespeople are performing well/poorly?). Usually, these are automated and web-based, putting the information at the fingertips of those who need it.", "Dashboards should answer the majority of standard business questions in a mature business intelligence environment.", "This is where users are proactively notified if something requires their attention. Business rules drive alerts. Some alerts require multiple sources of data, some only one source. It notifies someone they need to aware of some information and perhaps take some action. Examples includes:", "This is where the data complexity starts to increase. For statistical analysis to be meaningful the underlying data has to be good. The previous rungs of the ladder should ensure the data is of good quality. If people are using the information from previous rungs any existing data issues should have been corrected.", "This is where data is used to try and better understand something. For example, in a subscription business what factors lead to a subscription renewal? With PPI claims what characteristics of the loan lead to compensation? Within asset management what causes fund outflows?", "Based on what we have learned during the statistical analysis, what is the likely aggregate outcome? For example, what do we think the subscription renewal rate will be? How many PPI claims will require manual investigation? How much AUM is likely to be lost over the coming 12 months?", "This is where we attempt to predict what will happen in the future at an individual level.", "Predictive analytics has been in widespread use for a long time in financial services. For example:", "This could easily be a separate topic. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, which this article explains well. It should help better understand clients and subsequently make their experience more tailored to their needs. It can be further broken down:", "In the real world, there can be significant cross-over between the rungs. Also, it\u2019s not necessary to step on every rung of the ladder. For example, many data projects start on ladder rung 3, \u201cinteractive\u201d. Rung 4, \u201calerts\u201d, is often a by-product of \u201cinteractive\u201d.", "Similarly, \u201cpredictive analytics\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d can also be quite similar.", "However, what is true is the data understanding and amount of data sources does increase as one progresses up the ladder.", "Starting at the top of the ladder simply would not be possible without climbing the rungs below.", "Often data to information projects start small with simpler data sets. All organisations are different, some are data-driven, other less so.", "However, once these projects start to gain traction and start to prove their value they can lead to significant cultural change.", "The interest in data tends to rapidly spread throughout organisations of all sizes.", "There is a natural progression to expand to more data and use existing data in different ways.", "Simply by answering one question is likely to lead to more questions.", "Once an organisation moves to a more data-driven path, the business questions become endless.", "Your home for data science.
