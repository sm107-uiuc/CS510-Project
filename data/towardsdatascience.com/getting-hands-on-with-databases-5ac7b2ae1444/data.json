With high salaries and an ever-growing hype around AI, more and more people are trying to make the switch into data science.", "A quick Google search shows that database query languages such as SQL and NoSQL are among the top programming languages needed to become a data scientist. Compared to the other top programming languages, these are often harder to learn because there aren\u2019t many projects and tutorials out there build around learning databases. This is what led me to write this brief introduction to databases and how to set one up that you can use when learning the downstream analysis.", "Databases, at least relational ones, can be thought of as Excel spreadsheets on steroids. Each database is composed of tables, which can be thought of as the worksheets in Excel, and every table is composed of columns of data. However, there are constraints placed on the data stored in a database that are not present in Excel. For example, when creating a database table, the data type has to be specified for each column and can\u2019t be mixed within a column. Each table also has a primary key that is a unique identifier for each row. These can be specified (a username) or they can be autogenerated. They are also used to connect tables together. This should be enough information to follow along and if you want a more in-depth introduction to databases, I recommend checking out the first few lectures from this class at Stanford on Data Management and Data Systems.", "For this database, I decided to use the data that Instacart released in 2017 as part of a competition on Kaggle. I chose this data because it is clearly saved from a SQL database and some of the CSV files are too large to work with on a Chromebook. The data from Instacart can be found here along with the terms of service for using the data. To download the data, I copy the link address and use wget and untar to download and uncompress the data.", "With the example data downloaded, it\u2019s time to create the database. There are many different open-source SQL databases to choose from. For this, I decided to use PostgreSQL since it is the one I started with when deploying apps on Heroku. If you don\u2019t already have it installed, I find the easiest way to install it is using the installer provided by EDB Postgres.", "In the database, there will be a table for each of the CSV files. If we look at the head of aisles.csv , we see that there are two columns, one for the aisle id and the other for the name of the aisle.", "For the aisle table, we will need two columns as well. The first is filled with integers and is the primary key of the table and the second column is text of varying length. The following SQL will create such a table.", "Similar statements can be constructed for each of the tables and placed into a file called create_tables.sql.", "Each of the tables can be populated with data from the CSV files using the COPY table_name(columns) FROM 'path/to/csv/file.csv'; command. Again, we can put each of the SQL statements into a file called add_data.sql.", "Now that we have the code to create and populate the tables of our database, it\u2019s time to create the actual database. We can do this from the command line by first logging into Postgres, psql -U postgres . We can now run the command CREATE DATABASE instacart_db; to create the database. To checkout or connect to the database we enter \\c instacart_db in the terminal. After connecting to the newly created database we can create and populate the tables \\i create_tables.sql; followed by \\i add_data.sql;. Note that the time to populate the tables can take a while to run depending on the speed of your processor.", "We can now connect to the database with Python and start to do some analysis. To connect to the database we need to have psycopg2 installed. I find it easiest to install with conda because it can also install some of the library files needed. After running conda install psycopg2 you can start up a Jupyter notebook. I\u2019ve included a sample notebook that walks through how to connect to the database and execute SQL commands. In the notebook, I look at the products table to see what departments and aisles have the most products.", "I hope this has helped you to create a database that you can use for practicing SQL queries and data analysis. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or if you find any errors.", "Your home for data science.
