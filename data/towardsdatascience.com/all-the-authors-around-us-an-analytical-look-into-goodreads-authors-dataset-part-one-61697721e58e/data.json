The people composing Holy books, Poems, Novels, Philosophical Insights, History facts, Mangas, Fiction characters, and thousands of other genres, played a significant role in a person who we are, right now.", "Our insistence on changing every aspect of qualifications into describable numbers, tempted us to take a look into the world of Authors and their Books. In the first part of this blog post, we\u2019ll have a general look into a dataset of more than 200 Thousand authors from all over the world.", "I won\u2019t go into the technical details of this section, but Understanding the methods of data gathering is essential to confirm the accuracy of the analysis.", "One of the best and enormous data sources about the Books and Authors is GoodReads. Goodreads provides us with an API that makes a wide range of its dataset freely accessible; meanwhile, we can use BS4 to scrap the other parts. The complete python script for data gathering is available on my GitHub page.", "The final dataset is similar to the table below. To gather this amount of data, we needed around 800 hours, which took nearly three days on 15 droplets. As you see, 209517 Author\u2019s data has been gathered.", "It\u2019s natural to have some Null values in the dataset. For instance, we just have access to the gender of the 88587 Authors, and we don\u2019t know the rest, or there are only 7882 Authors who have mentioned by whom they\u2019ve been influenced.", "Number of Ratings, Reviews, and Followers follow a distribution similar to Power Law. As an instance, take a look at the histogram of the Reviews below. You can see that a large number of authors (more than 100,000 Authors) got less than 100 reviews to their books. On the other hand, on the tail of the diagram, we have few Authors with more than 100,000 Reviews on their books.", "If we arrange the Authors by the number of reviews and ratings, we\u2019ll get the following bar plot.", "J.K. Rowling with more than 24,000,000 Ratings is at the top. Stephen King, Suzanne Collins, Stephenie Meyer, and J.R.R. Tolkien are coming next. I assume all of us have seen some movies made based on these author\u2019s Novels.", "Users can rate books from 1 to 5 in GoodReads. Rating distribution follows a Normal Distribution. The average rating for the Authors is 3.87.", "Now, let\u2019s arrange the Authors based on their ratings.", "While J.K. Rowling is still at the top, many positions face changes. For example, George R. R. Martin and Khaled Hosseini gain a better place.", "The number of Books in GoodReads equals the number of books by that Author in different publications and different languages. For example, there are 246 books submitted for J.K. Rowling, while she has written fewer books originally.", "Correlation Matrix below can help us to get an answer to this question. There is a low correlation between the number of books and attracting more audiences.", "Writing more books doesn\u2019t essentially means to be successful Authors.", "As you can see, here we have an extra column, Shelved_books. This column shows the number of times that users have shelved the books of the authors. Unfortunately, getting this data for all of the 209k authors is time-consuming. Observing 200 authors shows a high correlation between Shelved Books and Review Counts.", "As we move past, there have been fewer authors. (Or at least fewer authors have been submitted in Goodreads.) And as the number of authors increases, the number of Reviews and Ratings also increases.", "Authors, who have born between 1860 and 1960 gained the highest number of attention in terms of Reviews and Ratings. Younger Authors need more time to be recognised.", "Nearly 8000 Authors have specified who has been their source of literal inspiration. While this is a small amount in comparison with the vast dataset of Authors, but we can still get some insights by looking at the results.", "As an example, Franz Kafka is among the top 20 most influencers list, while we can\u2019t see any sign of him among top 50 with high number of Reviews.", "The total number of men and women authors is almost the same and around 40,000. (Men are slightly higher) There are also a limited number of Non-binary Authors.", "In general, Female authors have more Followers than Male authors. They also make more engagement than men.", "The genres are available for more than 74000 authors. The bar plot below shows the number of books in different genres, distinguished by their Author\u2019s genders.", "nearly one-third of the authors, write fiction books. Romance, Contemporary and adult book genres are dominated by women and men are more active in politics, business, philosophy and science, while they write less.", "If we consider the number of reviews as a measure for popularity, the top 30 genres are as follows.", "Fiction and Romance books at the top and business, political, Scientific and philosophical books with a more limited audience are at the bottom.", "Here we can take a look at different genres during different centuries. The 20th century consists of the highest number of authors in our dataset. So, let\u2019s take a look at the genre distribution in this century.", "To compare the different genres during the time, we can take a look at the trace bars of different genres during decades.", "As time passes, religious and spiritual authors become less and less, while fictional and scientific books rise. Meanwhile, we see more history and biographies.", "While there are ~46000 authors whose birthplaces are available but the dataset is very dirty, because there are different names assigned for different cities and countries.", "We used an open-source database, called Geonames, to identify the countries and geographical information of the birth locations. The distribution of authors in the world is shown in the map below. As you can see, Northern America and Europe are densely populated with authors.", "Looking in details, show that the USA is at the top and UK, Canada, France, and Germany are the next with respect to the number of Authors.", "If we combine the Birthplaces with the Author\u2019s gender, we can observe the number of males, female and unknown authors in each country.", "In most of the countries, male authors are more than female authors. while in some countries like the USA, Canada, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, and Japan, Female authors are more than men. Interestingly, Jamaica also has high number of Female authors.", "Combining the Birth Dates and Birth Places, we reach a more limited dataset. But if we animate the results in a race chart, we\u2019ll see how the time affects the number of authors in each country.", "Genres distribution in different countries depends on many different parameters like social, economic, and cultural factors. These Radar Diagrams show dominant genres in a variety of countries.", "Take a look at the differences between Japan and Saudi Arabia. In Japan, Manga and Comics are very common, while in Saudi Arabia Fictional and religious books are dominant.", "With the Cleaned dataset of authors in hand, we can apply more analysis and make other insightful visualizations. Don\u2019t hesitate to get the dataset from Kaggle and start playing with it.", "In the next parts, we\u2019re going to get deeper into the biographies of the Authors and their Book descriptions. We will also take a look into the co-read network of the Authors.", "Your home for data science.
