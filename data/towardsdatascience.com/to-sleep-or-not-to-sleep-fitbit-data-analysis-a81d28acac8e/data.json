I somehow still struggle with managing my sleep at night!", "Note: This analysis is based on a limited sample size and might not generalize. It is meant to be a fun read!", "Through this blog I merged my sleep, fitness and browsing history to come up with correlations, some of them \u2018maybe\u2019 spurious!", "I got a new Fitbit Versa in May and since then have been tracking my sleep and exercise pretty much 24/7. I also interned full time over those months and hence had a pretty good schedule without much change.", "Weekends \u2014 Either study or travel", "I am a very erratic sleeper though. Some days I sleep for 9 hours and there are some days I hardly sleep. Either due to work or restlessness or because the temperature isn\u2019t right. I wanted to find out the best possible method to ensure a good night\u2019s sleep so that I am fresh the next day!", "I extracted my fitbit data from the dashboard online. It has the following columns:", "I annotated the data to add a \u2018Date\u2019 column that corresponds to the night of the sleep. If I wake up on 16th September for that row of data, I annotated it as 15th September. So even if I slept before 12 AM or after, it would be marked as 09/15.", "This image gives you an idea of how erratic my sleep is.", "My average time asleep is 6.33 hours with a standard deviation of 1.1 hours. Ideally I would like to have a standard deviation below 0.5!", "Yes the minimum has been 2 hours 5 minutes! (Thank you Georgia Tech! :D)", "Time in Bed = Minutes Asleep + Minutes Awake", "Minutes Asleep = Minutes REM Sleep + Minutes Deep Sleep + Minutes Light Sleep", "All these 3 sleep types are pretty positively correlated with minutes asleep.", "However even a small change in REM or Deep Sleep can make you grumpy or tired when you wake up.", "Just to explore a bit more I plotted the histogram of my Minutes Asleep and Time in Bed. Although the distribution seems like it is only shifted, there is some difference in the peak heights, indicating that there is some other factor that causes the relationship to vary between these two variables (thereby leading to changes in Minutes Awake).", "The joint plot below between number of awakenings and Time in Bed has a pearson coefficient of 0.74. This might imply that yes there is a strong positive relationship between the Time Spent in Bed vs the Number of Awakenings but that is not the only influencing factor.", "Number of Awakenings might depend on stress or exertion that day or a number of other factors.", "The most obvious choice was to get in my activity data.", "I added variables for day of the week and a weekend flag followed by time shifted variables to capture previous day values for Calories Burned, Steps, Distance, Floors, and all activity features.", "Minutes active are broadly categorized by fitbit as;", "Minutes Sedentary, Minutes Lightly Active, Minutes Fairly Active and Minutes Very Active", "Unlike sleep data, there is no visual relationship between these 4 categories and you can be very active without having a number of minutes in the fairly active category.", "However, if you closely notice, the very active graphs (pink) lags the fairly active (brown) in some cases.", "As expected, the weekend flag has a decently high correlation with minutes active. It also has a high negative correlation with Minutes Sedentary, implying that I don\u2019t just spend my weekends the couch. (Sorry Netflix)", "An observation I am happy about is that my activity (calories burned or activity calories) is not \u201chighly\u201d correlated (negatively) with my activity on the previous day, implying that I don\u2019t rest just because I went for a run or worked out the previous day.", "On combining dataset 1 (sleep) and dataset 2 (fitness), I got some interesting hypothesis.", "I had to dig deep to get some pattern out of the data. Yes this is not how analysis should be done, but I really wanted some understanding between my activity and sleep patterns.", "I\u2019ve always liked tracking my own usage patterns on chrome and installed a \u2018Webtime tracker\u2019 add-in on chrome. This tracked the time spent on each website (in seconds) and stops counting when I am idle for 45 seconds or if I navigate away from the page or if I switch apps.", "So time to get this in too!", "I split all the websites into 7 categories;", "General, Georgia Tech, News, Social Media, Sports, Video Streaming, and Work", "I don\u2019t know why but I like correlation plots a lot. From this one I\u2019d like to point out the relationship between Sports browsing and sleep.", "Deep sleep promotes physical recovery and aspects of memory and learning. This stage has also been shown to support your immune system.", "Light sleep promotes mental and physical recovery.", "This is what the Fitbit website mentions. So does watching more sports lead to more light sleep for mental recovery to get over the stress? I get very involved in football/soccer games (even if Arsenal isn\u2019t playing) and this very well might be true. But then however correlation does not mean causation!", "More social media => More sleep => Less deep sleep but more Light sleep (Mental recovery? Interesting..)", "I hope that through this I am at least able to reduce my standard deviation of Minutes asleep at night and have a better and more consistent sleep schedule!", "Your home for data science.
