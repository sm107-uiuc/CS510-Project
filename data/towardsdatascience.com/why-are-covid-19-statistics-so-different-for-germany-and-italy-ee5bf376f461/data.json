After finishing the article, I wasn\u2019t sure if I should publish it or not, because I did not like the dire conclusions in terms of the very similar, but time-shifted development in Italy and Germany. So I updated the data on Monday and Tuesday just to see if things changed significantly. They didn\u2019t.", "My analysis suggests that Italy is 7 to 19 days ahead of Germany. I think that the actual number is closer to the higher end of the range. This assumption is largely based on the ratio of administered tests to reported cases (13.1 tests per case in Germany; 3.9 in Italy) and the fact that population age groups are not so different.", "My analysis also suggests that Italy is overestimating its case fatality rate significantly due to the fact that there are probably many undetected cases.", "Let\u2019s first take a look at infection numbers across the two countries. At the time of writing this article, the following number of people were reported infected (based on data from John Hopkins University):", "Let\u2019s now have a look at the development over time for both countries. We can see that both countries \u2014 and everybody is well aware of that \u2014exhibit significant growth of infection numbers over time.", "At the time of writing this article, the following number of people were reported deceased due to the virus (based on data from John Hopkins University)", "The onset of first fatalities from COVID-19 set in with a lag when compared to infections, which is why here we look at data starting from March 1. Italy already exhibits deaths in the thousands, whereas the death toll in Germany is barely existent on the following chart.", "To calculate the case fatality rate, we divide the number of reported deaths by the number of reported infections. We should, however, be aware of the fact that there are two biases at play:", "Let\u2019s look at the calculated case fatality rates:", "I was astounded when looking at these numbers. They just do not make any sense to me. I started to research and found a couple of areas I wanted to investigate:", "It is often quoted that Italy has the second oldest population worldwide. An elderly population surely would explain the difference in the distribution of cases by age cohort for the two countries.", "So, maybe the age cohort distribution is different? I pulled data from the OECD stats page and compared the cohorts and find them to be very similar. Italy does have a slightly heavier long tail to the right. i.e., roughly 2% more of the population in the \u201c35\u201359 years\u201d cohort vs. Germany that has approximately the same 2% more in the \u201c15\u201334 years\u201d cohort.", "Further research could surely be spent on socio dynamic aspects of the two nations, i.e., how often do young adults visit their parents or even live with them. However, while I think it might explain some of the differences, it does not tell everything.", "It has been stated that Germany has very high test rates. And it is undoubtedly true that Germany\u2019s decentralized technically advanced labs (see video: 2:26) help with its testing capabilities. However, it\u2019s not like Italy hasn\u2019t also been testing. They have been doing so a lot.", "While the absolute number of tests administered is interesting, I think it also makes sense to look at the number of administered tests per detected case as a proxy for testing intensity. For March 22, this ratio would roughly look like this:", "There is probably some inaccuracy here due to turnaround times of tests, but overall the numbers seem to confirm that Germany is testing more extensively than Italy. Which makes it reasonable to assume that Germany captures more of the mild cases, whereas Italy probably has a bias towards the more severe ones that already show heavy symptoms. This assumption is in line with the statement (March 10) that Italy is only testing critical cases. In other words, the number of unidentified cases in Italy is probably much higher than in Germany. A higher number of unidentified cases, as mentioned earlier, will overestimate the case fatality rate.", "While I think the two previous arguments offer some explanations regarding the massively different case fatality rate, I think the reality is much simpler.", "It is tough for the human mind to comprehend exponential growth, which is why one might argue that the earlier charts regarding infections and deaths do not look too similar.", "However, If we take a look at it from another vantage point, where we reset Day 0 to a different day for both countries, then the development looks eerily similar.", "Let\u2019s look at a chart where we compare the development in terms of cumulative infections in Germany starting on March 1, 2020, with Italy beginning on February 23, 2020.", "These results mean that if we compare infection data from Italy for one week earlier (seven days) with German data, the patterns look remarkably similar.", "Let\u2019s now compare the development in terms of cumulative deaths in Germany starting on March 9, 2020, with Italy beginning on February 20, 2020.", "This means is that if we compare the number of deceased in Italy for nineteen days earlier with German data, the patterns again look remarkably similar. The good news, there seems to be some flattening for the German curve very recently.", "To me, it seems that Italy is 19 days ahead when comparing the cumulative deaths and 7 days ahead when comparing infection numbers. I think the fact that the lag is different for deaths and infections makes perfect sense given the more extensive testing in Germany (i.e. the true infection numbers in Italy are likely to be much higher and therefore we would have to go further back in time to find a matching period).", "Comparing periods based on the number of deaths is thus more conclusive and probably a better representation of reality. While there might be some differences when it comes to post-mortem testing and attribution of cause of death in case of multiple preconditions, I do think that even after accounting for those differences we would not see a very different picture.", "I just hope that we as a country can make good use of the headstart and can somehow avoid the worst of what is yet to come.", "To me, it became apparent from the analysis that Italy has many mild cases that have gone and still do go unnoticed and untested. Therefore they do not register in the accurate denominator when calculating the case fatality rate. An accurate case fatality rate is going to be significantly lower.", "If you are curious to learn about how COVID-19 spread through Germany, have a look at this visualization:", "Your home for data science.
