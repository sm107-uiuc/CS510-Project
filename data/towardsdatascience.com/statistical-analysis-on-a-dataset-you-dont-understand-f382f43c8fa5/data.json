The dataset provided was just a bunch of numbers in various columns with no indication of what the data might be. I always thought that the analysis of data required some knowledge and understanding of the data and the domain to perform an efficient analysis. I have attached a sample below. It consisted of columns from X0 to X29 which consisted of continuous values and XC which consisted of categorical data i.e. 30 variables in total. I set out on further analysis on the entire dataset to understand the data.", "I used the QQ plot to determine the normality distribution of the variables and understand if there is any skew in the data. All the data points were normally distributed with very less deviation which required no processing of the data to be done at this point to attain a Gaussian distribution. I prefer a QQ plot for the initial analysis because it makes it very easy to analyze the data and determine the type of distribution be it Gaussian distribution, uniform distribution, etc.", "Once the data is determined to be a normal distribution using the QQ plot, a Shapiro Wilk test can be performed to confirm the hypothesis. It has been deigned specifically for normal distributions. The null hypothesis, in this case, is that the variable is normally distributed. If the p value obtained is less than 0.05 then the null hypothesis is rejected and it is assumed that the variable is not normally distributed. All the values seem to be greater than 0.05 which means that all the variables follow a normal distribution.", "I checked the distribution of the categorical variable to check if the points in the dataset were equally distributed. The distribution of the variables was as shown below. The variable consisted of 5 unique values (A,B,C,D and E) with all the values being more or less equally distributed.", "I used a One-Hot Encoding mechanism to convert the categorical variables to a binary variable for each resulting categorical value as shown below. Although this resulted in an increase in dimensionality, I was hoping to check for correlations later on and remove or merge certain rows.", "Correlation is an important technique which helps in determining the relationships between the variables and weeding out highly correlated data. The reason we do this because we don't want variables that are highly correlated with each other since they affect the final dependent variable in the same way. The correlation values range from -1 to 1 with a value of 1 signifying a strong, positive correlation between the two and a value of -1 signifying a strong, negative correlation. We also calculate the statistical significance of the correlations to determine if the null hypothesis (There is no correlation) is valid or not. I have taken three values as benchmarks for measuring statistical significance \u2014 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01. The below table is a small sub sample of the correlation values for each set of variables. A p value which is less than 0.01 signifies a high statistical significance and that the null hypothesis can be rejected which is represented by 3 \u2018*\u2019 while the statistical significance is lesser if the p-value is lesser than 0.1 but greater than 0.05 which is represented by 1 \u2018*\u2019.", "The dataset above did not have any values which had a high correlation value. Thus, I safely went ahead with the assumption that the values were not related to each other. I further explored the correlation of the variables with the dependent variable y.", "We are concerned with the prediction of the variable y. As seen, there are a lot of variables which don't have any correlation to y as well as are not statistically significant at all which means that the relationship is weak and we can safely exclude them from the final dataset. These include variables such as X5, X8, X9, X10, XC_C, etc. I have not excluded the other variables which have low correlation but high statistical significance as there may be a small sample which affects the final dependent variable and we cannot exclude them completely. We can further reduce the variables by merging some of them. We do this on the basis of variables which have the same correlation value with the y variable. These include \u2014", "I merged these variables using an optimization technique. Let us consider the variable, X1 and X23. I achieved this by assuming a linear relation mX1 + nX23 with y. For determining the maximum correlation, we have to calculate the optimum value for m and n. In all the cases, I assumed n to be 1 and solved for m. The equation is as shown below.", "Once n is set as 1, we can easily solve for m. This can be substituted in the above linear equation for each value. In this way, we can merge all the above variables. If the denominator is 0, m can be taken as 1 and the equation can be solved for n. Make sure that the correlation values are equal for both the variables. After merging, I generated the correlation table again.", "We can see that the correlation values for the merged variables have increased and the statistical significance is high for all of them. I managed to reduce the number of variables from 30 to 15. I can now use these variables to feed it into my machine learning model and check the accuracy against the validation dataset.", "I chose a Logistic Regression model for the training and predicting on this dataset for multiple reasons \u2014", "After training the model, I checked the model against the validation dataset and these are the results.", "This was a basic exploratory and statistical analysis to reduce the number of features and assure that there are no correlated variables in the final dataset. Using a few simple techniques, we can be assured of getting good results even if we do not understand what the data is initially. The main steps include ensuring a normal distribution of data and an efficient encoding scheme for the categorical variables. Further, the variables can be removed and merged based on correlation among them after which an appropriate model can be chosen for analysis.
