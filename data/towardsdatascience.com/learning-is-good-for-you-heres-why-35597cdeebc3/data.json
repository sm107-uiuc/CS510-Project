A closer look at education, resumes, work, and health with learning.", "If you want to better yourself in data science, machine learning, programming, and visualizations, or any various career field and passion, there are countless avenues to improve your skillset. Whether your goal is to get into a university, better your resume, or promoted at work, there are excellent reasons and benefits to continue learning. Not only are there somewhat physical and tangible effects on learning, but there are also mental benefits as well. Below, I will discuss the top reasons along with examples to continue your path of learning.", "Learning itself within education is considerably valuable. Whether you are getting a masters degree or cranking out online courses, investing in education will ultimately pay back itself, along with granting new connections and lessons along the way.", "In my personal experience, education has been the reason why I am a data scientist today. A few years ago, I was working as an analytical chemist, which consumed most of my life at the time. I knew I was interested in something else similar, but different enough to start researching online different career paths. Once I spent some time browsing, I came along online masters programs (at this time, I already had an undergraduate degree in biology with minors in Chinese and chemistry). I found SMU, applied, and started my first courses a few months after. At the time, I was ready to learn and eager to start my journey in a new field. I learned countless valuable skills and gathered amazing connections from that education. It gave me the confidence and passion to pursue data science professionally. With education, my next reasonable step in learning was my resume.", "A resume can become an intimidating task to complete, as well as utterly overwhelming. You can search for endless examples and ways to create the best resume, but when you do that, you are really creating the best resume for the general population \u2014 not yourself.", "The best advice I have found in resume writing and creation, is to be yourself .", "However cliche it may sound, you would much rather be working for a company that you do not have to change yourself for, just like most things in life. Once you get in the habit of conforming yourself for others, it will have a negative effect on the jobs that do choose to hire you.", "There were times where companies would dislike that my resume was two pages or that it was blue in color. After changing it to one page and converting it to black and white, I realized I was just fitting in, but not standing out. I quickly turned my resume back to how it was originally, and that is when I saw positive feedback and response from companies that I really cared about and wanted to work for, not companies that wanted to change my process and personality.", "Learning how to make a resume is not as much about finding keywords that fit a very specific job description, but more so about highlighting your unique self, whether that be SQL or Tableau, an online course or a conference, list and include it if it is something you would truly like to do in your next role. Do not forget that it is not just interviewers trying to find a fit, you are as well.", "Learning is integral in promotion at the workplace. When employers see that you go out of your way and find passion in new skills and experiences that relate to your current job, you will soon reap the benefits of acknowledgment and promotion.", "For example, writing blogs yourself welcomes a community to your platform \u2014 where you can connect and learn from others; be heard, seen, and able to collaborate with some of the best in your field.", "Keep in mind this article is an opinion piece, and this form of learning works for me, and I hope it works for you as well. I believe that learning in itself is great for your brain. The main facet of health and learning can be summarized by neuroscience, more specifically known as neuroplasticity [4].", "It could possibly be that when you train yourself to learn, you will become better at learning further along the road, comparable to how a deep \u2014 machine learning algorithm works.", "Although an article not about code, machine learning algorithms, or tutorials, I believe it is important to stress the benefits of learning with key moments of your life. Perhaps you already believe this without reading my article, as you have subscribed or visited a blog, and take an effort in learning new things from articles.", "I hope this opinion article was interesting and helpful for you.
