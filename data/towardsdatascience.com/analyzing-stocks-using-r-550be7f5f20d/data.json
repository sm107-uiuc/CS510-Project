Many analysts also believe Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s value will continue to increase in the upcoming years. While it sounds tempting to purchase the stock, an elaborate in-depth analysis should be done to avoid purchasing the stock based on speculation.", "I implemented my knowledge in Statistics and R skills to analyze its performance from a technical side and predict its future price. I heavily relied on a packages frequently used in quantitative finance such as quant mod and xts to fulfill my goal.", "Here is the complete list of packages I used:", "I started my analysis by obtaining the log returns of Amazon\u2019s stock beginning August 1st, 2008 to August 17th, 2018:", "The log returns doesn\u2019t make sense at this stage but it is actually the fundamental of my analysis. I will explain later.", "I started by doing a technical analysis of Amazon\u2019s stock:", "The first chart series graph is straightforward as it shows Amazon\u2019s price chart:", "The second chart series show the Bollinger Band chart, % Bollinger change, Volume Traded and Moving Average Convergence Diverence in 2018 alone:", "The moving average is important to understanding Amazon(AMZN)\u2019s technical charts. It smoothes out daily price fluctuations by averaging stock prices and is effective in identifying potential trends.", "The Bollinger Band chart plots two standard deviations away from the moving average and is used to measure the stock\u2019s volatiliy. The Volume chart shows how its stocks are traded on the daily. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence gives technical analysts buy/sell signals. The rule of thumb is: If it falls below the line, it is time to sell. If it rises above the line, it is experiencing an upward momentum.", "The charts above are usually used to decide whether to buy/sell a stock. Since I am not a certified financial analyst, I decided to do additional research to convince myself.", "I implemented the underlying principle of public comparisons. I wanted to see how Amazon (AMZN) was doing in comparison to other popular technology stocks such as Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL).", "I first compared the risk/return rate of each stock. I took the mean of log return and standard deviation of log return. The mean is assumed as the consistent rate of return while standard deviation is the risk that comes with purchasing the stock. I used plotly, an interactive visualization tool, to illustrate my findings.", "Google (GOOGL) stock has the lowest risk and the lowest return. Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) are equally as risky but the latter has stronger returns. If you are risk-inclined, Tesla (TSLA) is a good investment as it has high risk and high returns. But if you are risk-adverse, like me, Apple (AAPL) is the best choice.", "A popular investing principle is to diversify your investments: do not put all your eggs in one basket. When purchasing stocks you should try to purchase stocks that share a small correlation because you want to maximize the total rate of return.", "Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) have the smallest correlation of 0.24 while Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) have the highest correlation of 0.56. The correlation between each stocks is high because they are all technology stocks. It is better to purchase stocks from different sectors to truly minimize the risk and maximize rates of return.", "I went on to predict the prices for Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s stock. I achieved this by the random walk theory and monte carlo method.", "The random walk theory is suited for a stock\u2019s price prediction because it is rooted in the believe that past performance is not an indicator of future results and price fluctuations can not be predicted with accuracy.", "I simulated the prices Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s stock for 252*4 trading days (Since a year has ~252 trading days). That is 4 years worth of trading!", "I generated the prices using the data I have earlier from log returns and used exponential growth rate to predict how much the stock will grow per day. The growth rate is randomly generated and dependent on the input values of mu and sigma.", "The chart above shows the simulated prices for ~1000 trading days. If you pay attention to my code I did not include a set.seed(). The simulated prices will change and is dependent on my seed. In order to come up with a stable prediction, the price simulation needs to use the monte carlo method, where the prices are simulated repeatedly for accuracy.", "The graph above isn\u2019t intuitive so I finalized my findings using percentile check the Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s price after four years.", "Don\u2019t take my word for it, but given from the result of my simulation, Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s stock may reach the price of $11198.10 in four years time or crash to a $834.60 low. You can compare my findings with Amazon (AMZN)\u2019s CAGR to determine if my finding makes sense. But if given the chance, I\u2019d purchase the stock right away!", "Thanks for reading!
