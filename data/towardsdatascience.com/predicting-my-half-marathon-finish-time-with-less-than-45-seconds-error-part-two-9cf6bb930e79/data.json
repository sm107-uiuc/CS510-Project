It is clear that it is advantageous to keep an even pace.", "That green cross? That\u2019s me, and while I can get any younger, there\u2019s certainly room for improvement by moving further down to the right on the chart. Doing analyses like this is especially fun when you can find yourself in the data, and learn how you can improve.", "Let\u2019s look further at how runners vary their pace, and if there are difference between men, women, and different age groups:", "Previous studies in gender differences in marathon pacing show that men overestimate themselves more than women. However, results shown in the above plot are not as significant as presented by J.Hubble and J.Zhao. This is in accordance with research of the Ljubljana marathon and half marathon finish times \u2014 gender differences for half marathons are less significant than for regular marathons.", "Is it correct to define overestimation as pace loss in the pace profile of the entire race, as suggested by the research available today? Probably, but I will suggest another metric that might give some further insights and is a bit more applicable to our machine learning model: hubris.", "Lets define hubris as a runner\u2019s pace loss relative to their initial pace (the first 5 kilometers).", "Indeed, men seem to burn out more than women do in the later stages of the race, but women drop more in pace between kilometer 5\u201310 and 10\u201315 compared to their opening pace. Which gender has the most hubris?", "If we look at the individual splits, it is clear that women have the most hubris in the earlier stages of the race. However, if we consider the plot as a whole, it could suggest that:", "Let us see if age groups show the same effect:", "A similar effect is visible here, but only for the last kilometer of the race.", "Because we cannot observe the same effect for age groups as we did for men and women between the first and second half of the race, the pace adjustment effect seems to be gender specific.", "Remember that these are averages for gender and age groups independently, and while men generally overestimate themselves more than women, it does not have to be true for specific gender and age group combinations.", "As a simplified single metric of hubris, we compute the average pace loss between kilometer 5 and 20, relative to the first 5 kilometers.", "We\u2019re trying to understand what, why and how metrics interact with each other. This helps us create mathematical concepts of our data to better predict what time a specific runner will finish at.", "In a real world scenario, we don\u2019t know anything about the runner\u2019s pace until he/she has passed a checkpoint. Let\u2019s say a runner had a pace between 10 and 15 kilometers that was equal to the pace of the first leg (5km). While we don\u2019t know anything about that runner\u2019s performance for the rest of the race, statistics tell us that on average, this runner will have a better finishing time than other runners.", "It is relatively straight forward to estimate a runner\u2019s finish time based on mean finishing times for their age and start group. The problem with this is you predict all runners in the same age and start group to the same finish time. Hence, this is not what we are going to do.", "Instead, we\u2019ll create a machine learning model that focuses on the individual runner. Features for this model can be conceptualized into two groups: general & specific features.", "A general feature is for example a runner\u2019s gender, age, start group or pace of the first leg. For me, these values would be:", "A specific feature is for example a runner\u2019s hubris after 10 kilometers, relative to the hubris of other runners. What\u2019s powerful with specific features is that we can fold them into any bucket type \u2014 we can have hubris relative to age group, or start group, or both. As an example, lets look at my hubris relative to my age group, start group, gender, and combination of start group and age group:", "In part 1, we looked mostly at general features, while this part should give you an idea of specific features. Specific features enrich our data with much more information than we had previously. The machine learning algorithm can leverage this additional data during training to build a more accurate model.", "Imagine we have a few points in multi-dimensional space, where every dimension except one represents a feature. The last dimension represents our target prediction \u2014 finish time. Every point corresponds to its coordinates in the space, and thus a point is a representation of its values for all possible features. This is our training data. We can fit a model against the points (could be a multi-dimensional function), and use the resulting model for predictions on new, unseen data that we know the feature values for.", "This is all hard to think about in more than three dimensions, so here\u2019s an example in two dimensions \u2014 using start group as our feature, and finish time as our target value :", "This model won\u2019t do a very good job. In order to get better predictions, it needs either a better algorithm to fit against the points, more examples to learn from, or additional features. Changing the function we used is not going to help a great deal since the variance for each start group is high. What we can do is add more features \u2014 dimensions \u2014 and use similar algorithms (but in higher dimensions).", "Luckily, we now happen to have a high number of features, our general and our specific features, that we can put in multidimensional space and fit a model to.", "An interesting challenge reveals itself when you consider that you need to perform the predictions in a live, realistic life scenario: We can\u2019t use specific features until the runner has started running. Hence, the pre-race prediction will have to be based on general features only. Specific features can be used as the runner progresses through the race, and will greatly improve the finish time prediction.", "Next up is part 3 which includes model training, performance analysis and a few example predictions. The model manages to predict my finish time within 30 seconds before the race even started (general features only), and gets better as the race progresses (when it can include specific features).", "Your home for data science.
