The COVID-19 pandemic has created a dilemma of ensuring public safety and health, while at the same time attempting to stabilize and sustain the economy.", "Meanwhile, obviously beneficial, available advanced technologies are not being fully used to maximize ethically sound, effective, and efficient approaches to reducing the pandemic effects on our societies and our economies. If there was ever a time to put such tools to use, it is now.", "Testing affords an understanding of disease characteristics and patterns \u2014 such as incidence, prevalence, recovery, and demography \u2014 and should have begun much earlier. Technologies for testing viral infection and exposure are mature, but they are uncoordinated and unlinked to scale-up pathways best found in the private sector. Genomic tests could reveal data on who is most at risk, and who is likely to be resilient. Thus, crucial data are absent that are needed to inform decision-making about the extent of physical distancing, implications for socio-economic revitalization, and readiness of U.S. defense forces.", "Early recognition of infectious diseases like COVID-19 requires a globally distributed array of hardware and software, placed in enough locations to create a network of linked collection sites. This requires the development of biosurveillance systems through collaborative ventures that involve strategic allies and public-private partnerships as well as international competitors. Such capability and cooperation do not exist at this time \u2014 either across the U.S. federal government or with many of our global partners. Mechanisms for cooperative surveillance with global competitors, while admittedly difficult, are currently strained, and therefore tenuous. Of course, caution and considerable deftness are required to realize such \u201ccooperative competition,\u201d and this requires a more trusting reliance upon intelligence and diplomatic services.", "Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital health approaches should be employed for modeling the potential spread of the virus, and identification, design and development of testing and therapeutic \u2014 if not preventative \u2014 interventions. AI and digital health were not part of preparedness protocols in the event that the most concerning pathogens were to become pandemics. Such preparedness would be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d if and when the pandemic began \u2014 rather than having to \u201cjump-start\u201d such efforts in pandemic response in the middle of a rapidly evolving crisis.", "Of course, any approaches to enable and provide individuals\u2019 real-time medical data create ethical, legal, and social concerns in both civilian and military settings. Legal measures need to be developed to prevent or mitigate potential bias in treatment and regard and to reduce the risk and possible effects of data hacking.", "Supply chains also require technology modernization. The COVID-19 effects on global trade have shown us the vulnerabilities in U.S. supply chains, their foreign dependence, and have revealed the need for more flexible and expedient supply lines. That requires rigorous inspections of imports, exploring innovative manufacturing technologies, and protecting against single-point failures from abroad.", "Many companies in the private sector have demonstrated that they can rapidly and flexibly steer biotechnology platforms toward the production and scaling of diagnostics and medical molecules, assisted by computational tools like the ones suggested above. These efforts should more regularly reinforce traditional supply chains.", "The COVID-19 crisis should be regarded in the literal sense \u2014 a time of change. There are lessons to be learned from the pandemic of 1918 that can be applied to the here-and-now. Just as systems of medical response were threatened, prompted to respond, and changed by the pandemic of 1918, so too must those infrastructures and functions of the government, civilian and commercial sectors of today.", "Current emerging biotechnologies could \u2014 and should \u2014 be engaged to develop advanced diagnostic tests and tools, create more accurate epidemiological models, innovate medical countermeasures and manufacturing platforms, and digitally engage U.S. citizens in the response. Such methods must be used within a networked biosecurity enterprise that engages a whole-of-nation system to enable a more effective and efficient response, whether or not the threats are natural or manmade. Such a system would enable the capability to far better predict, prepare, if not prevent the next biosecurity issue, and not merely repeat the errors of the last.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
