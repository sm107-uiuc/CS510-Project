I can\u2019t help with the first two \u2014 but if you\u2019ve ever wondered, \u201cis there actually a method to this matchmaking madness?\u201d, then this article is for you.", "\u2018Competitive\u2019 \u2014 or \u2018Comp\u2019 as it is often referred to \u2014 appears to be using a modified version of the popular Elo rating system for its matchmaking and ranking purposes. The Elo system is probably best known for its use in professional chess (for which it was developed by the Hungarian-American physicist Arpad Elo), but it has since been applied to numerous other sports, competitive video games (PUBG for example), and can even be utilized to determine the dominance hierarchy of males within the social groups of animals.", "In this article, I will discuss the Elo rating system as well as the math behind its matchmaking. From there, I will use the data from thousands of Competitive Overwatch games to determine if and how the matchmaking equation has been modified within the game.", "In the Elo system, competitors are assigned a numerical rating. When matching two players against each other, the player with the higher numerical rating is expected to win. A player\u2019s Expected Score can be calculated using the difference between the ratings of two players, which for our purposes can be considered the likelihood of winning.", "After a game is completed, each player\u2019s rating will be adjusted based on the outcome. The winner will take points from the loser, with no points being exchanged on a draw.", "Since the rating adjustment under the Elo system is based on the outcome of the game, a player\u2019s actual performance during the match is somewhat irrelevant. The only thing that factors into the exchange of points are the starting conditions and the outcome, taking into account the relative rankings of the two players. Therefore, the Elo system doesn\u2019t directly measure a player\u2019s skill but instead infers a player\u2019s skill based on their wins, losses, draws and the relative skill of the opponents they play.", "As mentioned previously, the Expected Score uses the relative rankings of players to quantify how likely a player is to win against an opponent. In the Elo system, if Player A has the ranking R_a and Player B has the ranking R_b, then we can calculate Player A\u2019s Expected Score (E_a) in a match against Player B as follows:", "Which looks like this when plotted:", "As we\u2019ll see later in the article, the vast majority of Competitive Overwatch matches consist of teams with a rating difference of less than 100. If we zoom in on the Elo expected score curve for that range, we see that the curve here looks linear:", "It turns out that the curve is approximately linear in this range, and fitting this section of the curve with a simple linear regression gives an Adjusted R-Squared value of 0.999 with a high degree of significance for the intercept and slope coefficient. This allows us to estimate (pretty damn closely) how Player A\u2019s Expected Score (likelihood of winning) increases or decreases for each extra rating point they have over their opponent \u2014 or their opponent has over them! According to the fit: for each rating point they have over their opponent, Player A\u2019s likelihood of winning increases by 0.14%, and similarly decreases by 0.14% percent for each point that their opponent has on them. Keep in mind that this only holds for the range of +/- 100 rating points, where the curve is essentially linear.", "If Overwatch used the exact same parameters as the Elo system, a team with a 50 point rating advantage would be 7% more likely to win than if they had no rating advantage (going from 50% to 57%). Conversely, a team with a 50 rating disadvantage would be 7% less likely to win than if there was no rating difference (going from 50% to 43%). Therefore, in a match-up where Team A has a 50 point rating advantage over Team B, Team A is actually 14% more likely to win than is Team B (57% for Team A vs. 43% for Team B).", "Very broadly, this is how Overwatch\u2019s Competitive game mode functions:", "So things look pretty similar to the Elo system we discussed above.", "In order to determine if Overwatch\u2019s Competitive mode is using the standard Elo formula for Expected Score or a modified version, I will calculate the experimental Expected Score for varying magnitudes of rating differences. That is the same as asking the question \u2014 \u201chow often did a team win when they had a 50 point rating advantage? What about a 25 point rating advantage?\u201d, and so on. I will then fit those points to the equation below to determine the value of k\u2019 (which is 400 in the standard Elo formulation).", "After realizing that it would take far too long to collect a sufficient amount of game data myself (typically matches last anywhere from 10\u201330 minutes), I came across this incredible data set by Myles O\u2019Niell with data on over 3,000 Competitive Overwatch games.", "Keeping in mind the Elo formula, the columns of interest from the data set are:", "Looking at the distribution of the average team ratings (below), we see that the median, IQR, and shape of distribution are almost identical for both my_team_sr and enemy_team_sr. Additionally, they range from about 1900 to 3100, which gives us a good representation of the typical Competitive Overwatch player. Note that if there is a different behavior in the extreme lower or higher rankings, we will not be able to see that. Thus, we must remember the group of players to which our findings will apply.", "Below, we see that the differences between the teams\u2019 ratings for each match appears to be normally distributed. We also see that the vast majority of games played occur between teams that have average ratings that are within 100 SR of each other.", "The distribution is very slightly negatively biased, as evidenced by negative median and mean.", "Additionally, it doesn\u2019t appear that the results of the games are particularly biased towards wins or losses.", "The next step is to get an understanding of how the Expected Score changes as the rating between the two teams changes. Recall that the formula for Expected Score is:", "Expected Score = Probability of winning + 1/2 (Probability of Drawing)", "So we need to know how likely teams are to win and how likely they are to draw as their opponent\u2019s rating increases or decreases (relative to theirs). I chose to do this via a simulation that randomly chooses games from the data set and calculated the probabilities based on the number of those games played, won, and drawn.", "Since the distribution of team_sr_delta is normal, that means we will have a very large group of games where the ratings of the two teams are very close together, and far fewer games where the ratings are further apart. So I can be pretty confident when finding the win rate of games played with SR deltas between say \u2014 0 and 25. However, if I\u2019m looking at games with SR deltas between 75 and 100, that win percentage is more susceptible to erroneous findings due to smaller sample size and noise in the data.", "To overcome this, I binned each game based on the SR delta and created a simulation that would do very simple oversampling and undersampling for games in each bin. The simulation selects 100 games at random from each bin \u2014 with replacement since some of the bins are quite small. It then counts the number of games that resulted in wins and draws and calculates the Expected Score. It does this 1,000 times. You can find the R code for the simulation loop below (if you\u2019re into that kinda stuff).", "After running the simulation, I aggregated by bin so I can get a good idea of the distribution of Expected Score by bin.", "Now that they are binned by the SR delta between teams, we can look at the distribution of Expected Scores from the simulations based on the bin (shown below). We can see that at the top left where the enemy team has a rating disadvantage of between -100 and -75, \u201cmy team\u201d has a higher expected score (probability of winning) than when the enemy team has a rating advantage of between 75 to 100 (bottom right). I\u2019ve included the dashed line at 0.5 to make comparisons between bins easier.", "We also see that distribution in each of the bins is approximately normal, which means that we can do things like regression and confidence intervals without too much concern of violating underlying assumptions. We are now ready to compare the simulation data to the Elo Expected Score equation!", "Using the data generated by the simulation, we can now fit the following equation to our real world Competitive Overwatch data.", "Standard Elo Expected Score Equation, steepness = 400", "Equation that I will be fitting to determine steepness", "In order to actually fit it based on the binned simulation data, I set Team SR Delta in the denominator to the midpoint of each bin (i.e. Bin1: -100 to -75 has a midpoint of -87.5).Using nonlinear least squares I fit the equation in R using the following code (Note that the k = 200 starting parameter is arbitrary, I tried a number of different starting values from 100 to 1000 and they all gave the same result!):", "We have a value of 831.8 instead of 400! But how certain are we of this estimate? Using the R function confint(), we can determine the 95% confidence interval for this coefficient, which gives a lower and upper bound of 803.8 and 861.7, respectively. Therefore, we can pretty damn confidently say that the Overwatch is not using the value of 400 used in the traditional Elo formulation, but instead is using a value closer to 800!", "Earlier on we saw that using the standard Elo formula, a player that has a 400 point rating advantage over an opponent would be 10 times as likely to win (or have an Expected Score that is 10 times larger) than their opponent. This was a consequence of having the value of 400 explicitly in the equation as a scaling factor. Our experimental data shows that the real value is likely closer to 800 \u2014 meaning that you would have to have an 800 rating advantage over your opponent to be 10 times more likely to win than them. The effect of this is a flatter, smoother curve.", "Also, recalling that most games occur with an SR difference between teams of less than 100, and that between this range the curve can be very closely approximated with a linear fit.", "For each rating point they have over their opponent, Player A\u2019s likelihood of winning increases by 0.069%, and decreases by 0.069% percent for each point that their opponent has on them. Not so coincidentally, this is half of the rate of change using the standard Elo curve (why do you think this is?).", "Finally, I\u2019ve created a table that calculates the Expected Score for your team given an opposing team\u2019s relative SR, as well as the difference in your win probability compared to if the match was between 2 equally rated teams.", "I had a lot of fun figuring this problem out, and intend to continue with another article that examines Overwatch\u2019s post-match rating adjustments compared to the standard Elo rating adjustments.
