And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.", "I\u2019m almost finished now. I\u2019ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role. So I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.", "For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few coding classes for the beginner data scientist.

Also, data visualization.", "For this guide, I spent a dozen hours trying to identify every online machine learning course offered as of May 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings.

Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.", "Each course must fit three criteria:", "We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria.

So please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.", "We compiled average ratings and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.", "We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on three factors:", "A popular definition originates from Arthur Samuel in 1959: machine learning is a subfield of computer science that gives \u201ccomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\u201d In practice, this means developing computer programs that can make predictions based on data. Just as humans can learn from experience, so can computers, where data = experience.", "A machine learning workflow is the process required for carrying out a machine learning project.

It has a 4.7-star weighted average rating over 422 reviews.", "Released in 2011, it covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow. Though it has a smaller scope than the original Stanford class upon which it is based, it still manages to cover a large number of techniques and algorithms. The estimated timeline is eleven weeks, with two weeks dedicated to neural networks and deep learning. Free and paid options are available.", "Ng is a dynamic yet gentle instructor with a palpable experience. He inspires confidence, especially when sharing practical implementation tips and warnings about common pitfalls. A linear algebra refresher is provided and Ng highlights the aspects of calculus most relevant to machine learning.", "Evaluation is automatic and is done via multiple choice quizzes that follow each lesson and programming assignments. The assignments (there are eight of them) can be completed in MATLAB or Octave, which is an open-source version of MATLAB. Ng explains his language choice:", "Though Python and R are likely more compelling choices in 2017 with the increased popularity of those languages, reviewers note that that shouldn\u2019t stop you from taking the course.", "A few prominent reviewers noted the following:", "Columbia University\u2019s Machine Learning is a relatively new offering that is part of their Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters on edX. Though it is newer and doesn\u2019t have a large number of reviews, the ones that it does have are exceptionally strong. Professor John Paisley is noted as brilliant, clear, and clever. It has a 4.8-star weighted average rating over 10 reviews.", "The course also covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow and more algorithms than the above Stanford offering. Columbia\u2019s is a more advanced introduction, with reviewers noting that students should be comfortable with the recommended prerequisites (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability, and coding).", "Quizzes (11), programming assignments (4), and a final exam are the modes of evaluation. Students can use either Python, Octave, or MATLAB to complete the assignments. The course\u2019s total estimated timeline is eight to ten hours per week over twelve weeks. It is free with a verified certificate available for purchase.", "Below are a few of the aforementioned sparkling reviews:", "Machine Learning A-Z\u2122 on Udemy is an impressively detailed offering that provides instruction in both Python and R, which is rare and can\u2019t be said for any of the other top courses. It has a 4.5-star weighted average rating over 8,119 reviews, which makes it the most reviewed course of the ones considered.", "It covers the entire machine learning workflow and an almost ridiculous (in a good way) number of algorithms through 40.5 hours of on-demand video. The course takes a more applied approach and is lighter math-wise than the above two courses. Each section starts with an \u201cintuition\u201d video from Eremenko that summarizes the underlying theory of the concept being taught. de Ponteves then walks through implementation with separate videos for both Python and R.", "As a \u201cbonus,\u201d the course includes Python and R code templates for students to download and use on their own projects.
