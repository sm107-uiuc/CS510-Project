Set in the 26th century, it\u2019s the story of a space voyage to colonize planets outside our Solar System. Robinson writes in the tradition of \u201chard science fiction,\u201d using only existing or plausible technology for his interstellar journey. As much as he geeks out on the mechanics of space travel, his real interest is how people would handle a very long voyage trapped inside a starship. His futuristic themes won\u2019t surprise longtime fans of Robinson, who\u2019s best known for his Mars trilogy, published in the 1990s. To read KSR is to wonder how our species might survive and even thrive in the centuries ahead.", "The author stopped by my radio studio before giving the keynote speech at a local science fiction conference. We talked about the existential angst of life on a starship, the future of artificial intelligence and the aesthetics of space travel. Our conversation will air on Public Radio International\u2019s To the Best of Our Knowledge. You can subscribe to the TTBOOK podcast\u00a0here.", "Steve Paulson: How would you describe the story in\u00a0Aurora?", "Kim Stanley Robinson: It\u2019s the story of humanity trying to go to other star systems. This may be an ancient idea, but for sure it\u2019s a 19th century idea. The Russian space scientist Tsiolkovsky said Earth is humanity\u2019s cradle but you\u2019re not meant to stay in your cradle forever. This idea has been part of science fiction ever since\u200a\u2014\u200athat humanity will spread through the stars, or at least through this\u00a0galaxy.", "SP: It\u2019s a long way to travel to another\u00a0star.", "KSR: It is a long way. And the idea of going to the stars is getting not easier, but more difficult. So I decided to explore the difficulties. I tried to think about whether it\u2019s really possible at all, or if we\u2019re condemned\u200a\u2014\u200aif you want to put it that way\u200a\u2014\u200ato stay in this Solar\u00a0System.", "SP: What star are your space voyagers trying to get\u00a0to?", "KSR: Tau Ceti, which has often been the destination for science fiction voyagers. Ursula Le Guin\u2019s Dispossessed takes place around Tau Ceti, and so does Isaac Asimov\u2019s The Naked Sun. It\u2019s about 12 light-years away. We now know it has three or four big planets the size of a small Neptune or a large Earth. They\u2019ve got the mass of about five Earths. That\u2019s too heavy for humans to be on, but those planets could have moons about the size of Earth. So it becomes the nearest viable target. Alpha Centauri, which is just four light-years away, only has tiny planets that are closer than Mercury is to our sun, so they won\u2019t be habitable.", "SP: Your story is set 500 years into the future. It takes a long time to get to this\u00a0star.", "KSR: Yes. My working principle was, what would it really be like? So no hyperspace, no warp drive, no magical thing about what isn\u2019t really going to happen to get us there. That means sub-lightyear speeds. So I postulated that we could get spaceships going to about one-tenth the speed of light, which is extraordinarily fast. Then the problem becomes slowing down. You have to carry enough fuel to slow yourself down if you\u2019ve accelerated to that kind of speed. The mass of the decelerant fuel will be about 90% of the weight of your ship. As you\u2019re approaching your target, you have to get back down to the speed at which you can orbit your destination. The physics of this is a huge\u00a0problem.", "SP: You\u2019re talking about a multi-generational voyage that will take a couple hundred years. That\u2019s a fascinating idea. The people who start out will be dead by the time the starship gets\u00a0there.", "KSR: I guessed it would take four or five generations\u200a\u2014\u200asay, 200 years. This is not my original idea. The multi-generational starship is an old science fiction idea started by Robert Heinlein and there may even be earlier precursors. One always finds forgotten precursors for every science fiction idea. Heinlein wrote Universe around 1940, Brian Aldiss wrote a book called Starship in 1958, and Gene Wolfe wrote a very great starship narrative in the 1990s, The Book of the Long Sun. So it\u2019s not an original idea to me; it\u2019s sort of a sub-genre within science\u00a0fiction.", "SP: But the whole idea of a project that takes generations is something we don\u2019t do anymore. People did that when they built the pyramids in Egypt or the great cathedrals in Europe. I can\u2019t think of a current project that will take generations to complete.", "So it turned into a bit of a prison\u00a0novel.", "KSR: You really have to think of it as a mobile island or a vast zoo. It isn\u2019t even a project so much as a city that you\u2019ve shot off into space, and when the city gets to its destination, the people unpack themselves into the new place. You\u2019re right, it could be compared to building the cathedrals. And it\u2019s interesting to think about the people born on the starship who didn\u2019t make the choice to be there. So it turned into a bit of a prison\u00a0novel.", "SP: Because you\u2019re trapped there. You\u2019re in this confined space for your whole\u00a0life.", "KSR: And for two or three generations, you\u2019re born on the ship and you die on the ship. You\u2019re just in between the stars. So it\u2019s very existential. There are some wonderful thought stimulants to thinking about a starship as a closed\u00a0ecology.", "SP: How big is the starship in your\u00a0story?", "KSR: There\u2019s something like a hundred kilometers of interior\u00a0space.", "KSR: Yeah, two rings. You could imagine them as cylinders that have been linked until they make a circle, so twelve cylinders per circle. You\u2019ve got 24 cylinders and each has a different Earth ecology in it and each one of them is about five kilometers long. It\u2019s pretty big, but you need that much space to be viable at all because you have to take along a Noah\u2019s Ark worth of genetic material, or else it isn\u2019t going to\u00a0work.", "SP: What do you have to bring\u00a0along?", "KSR: You would want as much of everything as you can bring, but you certainly need a big bacterial load. You need to bring along a lot of soil. You need a lot of what would be effectively unidentified bacteria; you just need a big hunk of earth. And then all the animals that you can fit that would survive. Each one of these cylinders would be like a little zoo or\u00a0aviary.", "SP: As you were imagining this voyage, which part was most interesting to you? Was it the science\u200a\u2014\u200atrying to figure out technically how we could get there? Or was it the personal dynamics of how people would get along when they\u2019re trapped in space for so\u00a0long?", "KSR: I think it would be the latter. I\u2019m an English major. The wing of science fiction that\u2019s discussed this idea has been the physics guys, the hard SF guys. They\u2019ve been concerned with propulsion, navigation, with slowing down, with all the things you would use physics to comprehend. But I\u2019ve been thinking about the problem ecologically, sociologically, psychologically. These elements haven\u2019t been fully explored and you get a new story when you explore them. It\u2019s a rather awful story, which leads to some peculiar narrative choices.", "KSR: Because they\u2019re trapped and the spaceship is a trillion times smaller than Earth\u2019s surface. Even though it\u2019s big, it\u2019s small. And we didn\u2019t evolve to live in one of these things. It\u2019s like you spend your whole life in a Motel\u00a0Six.", "SP: Put that way, it does sound pretty\u00a0awful.", "KSR: Better than a prison, but you can\u2019t get out. You can\u2019t choose to do something else. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meant for that even though we live in rooms all the time in modern society. I think the reason people volunteer for things like Mars One is they\u2019re thinking, \u201cHow is that different from my ordinary life? I sit in a room in front of my laptop all day long. If I\u2019m going to Mars, it\u2019s more interesting.\u201d", "SP: Mars One is the project that\u2019s trying to engineer one-way trips to Mars. You know you\u2019re not going to come back. Frankly, it sounds like a suicide mission, and yet tens of thousands of people have signed up for this\u00a0mission.", "KSR: Yes, but they\u2019ve made a category error. Their imaginations have not managed to catch up to the situation. They are in some kind of boring life and they want excitement. Maybe they\u2019re young, maybe they\u2019re worried about their economic prospects, maybe they want something different. They imagine it would be exciting if they got to Mars. But it was Ralph Waldo Emerson who said travel is stupid; wherever you go, you\u2019re still stuck with yourself. I went to the South Pole once. I was only there for a week and it was the most boring place in Antarctica because we couldn\u2019t really leave the rooms without getting into space\u00a0suits.", "SP: Is extended space travel like going to Antarctica?", "KSR: It\u2019s the best analogy you can get, especially for Mars. You would get to a landscape that\u2019s beautiful and sublime and scientifically interesting and mind-boggling. Antarctica is all those things and so would Mars be. But I notice that nobody in the United States cares about what the Antarcticans are doing every November and December. There are a couple thousand people down there having a blast. If the same thing happened on Mars, it would be like, \u201cOh, cool. Some scientists are doing cool things,\u201d but then you go back to your real life and you don\u2019t\u00a0care.", "SP: So even though you write about these long space voyages, you wouldn\u2019t want to be part of\u00a0one?", "KSR: Not at all. But I\u2019ve only written about long space voyages once\u200a\u2014\u200ain this book,\u00a0Aurora.", "SP: You also wrote a whole series of books about Mars. You still have to get\u00a0there.", "KSR: But there\u2019s an important distinction. You can get to Mars in a year\u2019s travel and then live there your whole life. And you\u2019re on a planet, which has gravity and landscape. You can terraform it. It\u2019s like a gardening project or building a cathedral. I think terraforming Mars is viable. Going to the stars, however, is completely different because you would be traveling in a spaceship for several generations where you\u2019re in a room, not on a planet. It\u2019s been such a techie thing in science fiction. But people haven\u2019t de-stranded those two ideas. They said, \u201cWell, if we can go to Mars, we can go to Tau Ceti.\u201d It doesn\u2019t follow. It\u2019s not the same kind of\u00a0effort.", "SP: Would it be interesting to travel just through our own Solar\u00a0System?", "KSR: Yes, this Solar System is our neighborhood. We can get around it in human time scales. We can visit the moons of Saturn. We can visit Triton, the moon of Neptune. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroids on which we could set up bases. The moons of all the big planets are great. The four big moons of Jupiter\u200a\u2014\u200awe couldn\u2019t be on Io because it\u2019s too radioactive or too impacted by the radio waves of Jupiter itself\u200a\u2014\u200abut by and large, the Solar System is fascinating.", "SP: Yet I imagine a lot of people would say, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot of cool stuff out there, but it\u2019s all\u00a0dead.\u201d", "KSR: Well, we have questions about Mars, Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. Wherever there\u2019s liquid water in the Solar System, it might be dead or alive. It might be bacterially alive. It might have life that started independently. It might be cousin life that was blasted off of Mars on meteorites and landed on Earth and other places. We don\u2019t know yet. And if it is dead, it\u2019s still beautiful and interesting, so these would be sites of scientific interest. Antarctica is pretty dead, but we still go\u00a0there.", "SP: I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s incredibly beautiful.", "I think Earth is the one and only crucial place for humanity. It will always be our only\u00a0home.", "KSR: It\u2019s very beautiful. I think if you\u2019re standing on the surface of Europa, looking around the ice-scape and looking up at Saturn in the sky overhead, it\u2019s also going to be beautiful. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s beautiful enough to drive a gigantic effort to get there. The robots going there now are already a tremendous exploration for humanity. The photos sent back to us are a gigantic gift and a beautiful thing to look at. So humans going there will always be a kind of research project that a few scientists do. I\u2019m not saying that the rest of the Solar System is crucial to us. I think Earth is the one and only crucial place for humanity. It will always be our only\u00a0home.", "SP: I wonder if we would develop a different sense of beauty if we went out into the Solar System. When we think of natural beauty, we tend to think of gorgeous landscapes like mountains or deserts. But out in the Solar System, on another planet or a moon, would our experience of awe and wonder be different?", "KSR: You can go back to the 18th century when mountains were not regarded as beautiful. Edmund Burke and the other philosophers talked about the sublime. So the beautiful has to do with shapeliness and symmetry and with the human face and figure. Through the Middle Ages, mountains were seen as horrible wastelands where God had forgotten what to do. Then in the Romantic period, they became sublime, where you have not quite beauty but a combination of beauty and terror. Your senses are telling you, \u201cThis is dangerous,\u201d and your rational mind is saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m on a ledge, but I\u2019ve got a railing. It looks dangerous, but it\u2019s not.\u201d You get this thrilling sensation that is not beauty but is the sublime. The Solar System is a very sublime\u00a0place.", "SP: Because you could die at any moment if your oxygen support system goes\u00a0out.", "KSR: Exactly. It\u2019s like being in a submarine or even in scuba gear\u200a\u2014\u200athe feeling of being meters under the surface, with a machine keeping you alive and bubbles going up, as you\u2019re looking at a coral reef. That\u2019s sublimity. There\u2019s an element of terror that\u2019s suppressed because your rational mind is saying it\u2019s okay. When you fly in an airplane and look down 30,000 feet to the surface of the earth, that\u2019s the feeling of the sublime, even if you\u2019re looking down at a beautiful landscape. But people can\u2019t bear to look because after a while you\u2019re thinking, \u201cBoy, this machine sure has to\u00a0work.\u201d", "SP: If you think long and hard about\u00a0this\u2026", "KSR: You might never fly\u00a0again.", "SP: One thing that\u2019s so interesting about your novel Aurora is that most of it is narrated by the ship itself. What was the idea\u00a0here?", "KSR: I do like the idea that my narrators are also characters, that they\u2019re not me. I\u2019m not interested in myself. I like to tell other people\u2019s stories, so I don\u2019t do memoir. I do novels. And for three or four novels now, it\u2019s been an important game to me to imagine the narrators\u2019 voices being different from mine. So Shaman\u2019s was the Third Wind, this mystical spirit that knew the Paleolithic inside and out. That wasn\u2019t me. And Cartophilus, the time traveler, tells Galileo\u2019s story.", "\u2026a novel is not a natural act. It\u2019s an art form that\u2019s been built up over centuries and doesn\u2019t have a good algorithm.", "In Aurora, it made sense for the ship to need really powerful artificial intelligence, like a quantum computer. And once you get to quantum computers, you\u2019ve got processing speeds that are equal to the processing speeds of human brains. But the methodologies would be completely different. They\u2019d be algorithms that we programmed. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have consciousness, but when you get that much processing speed, who\u2019s to say what consciousness really is? So I made the narrator out of this starship\u2019s AI system. And he\u200a\u2014\u200ashe, it\u200a\u2014\u200ahas been instructed by the chief engineer to keep a narrative account of the voyage. When you think about it, writing novels is strange. We can tell most stories to each other in about 500 words, so a novel is not a natural act. It\u2019s an art form that\u2019s been built up over centuries and doesn\u2019t have a good algorithm.", "SP: I recently interviewed Stephen Wolfram, the computer theorist and software developer, and asked if he thought some future computer could write a great novel. He said\u00a0yes.", "KSR: Wolfram\u2019s very important in theorizing what computers can do because he\u2019s made a breakdown of activities from the simple to the complex. And at full complexity, the human brain or any other thinking machine that can get to that fourth level of complexity should be able to do\u00a0it.", "SP: So in the future, you think a computer or artificial intelligence system could write a modern \u201cUlysses\u201d?", "KSR: Well, this is an interesting question. At that point you would need a quantum computer. It would need to read a whole bunch of novels and try to abstract the rules of storytelling and then give it a shot. In my novel, the first chapter the computer writes is 18th century literature. It\u2019s what we would call \u201ccamera-eye point of view.\u201d It doesn\u2019t guess what people are thinking; how can it? It just reports what it sees like a Hemingway short story. As the novel goes on, chapter by chapter, the computer is recapitulating the history of the novel, and by the end of the last chapter narrated by the computer, you\u2019re getting full-on stream of consciousness. It\u2019s kind of like Ulysses or Virginia Woolf where you\u2019re inside the mind, although it\u2019s the mind of the computer itself. The last chapter is in a kind of \u201cflow state\u201d of the computer\u2019s thinking.", "SP: At that point, does the computer have emotions?", "KSR: It wonders about that. The computer can\u2019t be sure. Actually, we\u2019re all trapped in our own consciousness. What are other people thinking? What are other people feeling? You have to work by analogy to your own internal states. The computer only has access to its own internal\u00a0states.", "SP: Does the future of AI and technology more generally excite\u00a0you?", "KSR: Yes, AI in particular. I used to scoff at it. I\u2019m a recent convert to the idea that AI computing is interesting. Mainly, it\u2019s just an adding machine that can go really, really fast. There are no internal states. They\u2019re not thinking. However, quantum computers push it to a new level. It isn\u2019t clear yet that we can actually make quantum computers, so this is the speculative part. It might be science fiction that completely falls apart. There was science fiction about easy space travel, but that\u2019s not going to work. There was science fiction about all of us living 10,000 years. That might or might not work, but it\u2019s way speculative. Quantum computing is still in that category because you get all the weirdness of quantum mechanics. There are certain algorithms that might take a classical computer 20 billion years, while a quantum computer would take 20 minutes. But those are for very particular tasks, like factoring a thousand-digit number. We don\u2019t know yet whether more complex tasks will be something that a quantum computer can handle better than a regular computer. But the potential for stupendous processing power, like a human brain\u2019s processing power, seems to be\u00a0there.", "SP: As a science fiction writer, do you have a particular mission to imagine what our future might be like? Is that part of your\u00a0job?", "KSR: Yes, I think that\u2019s central to the job. What science fiction is good at is doing scenarios. Science fiction may never predict what is really going to happen in the future because that\u2019s too hard. Strange things, contingent things happen that can\u2019t be predicted, but we can see trajectories. And at this moment, we can see futures that are complete catastrophes where we cause a mass extinction event, we cook the planet, 90% of humanity dies because we run out of food or we think we\u2019re going to run out of food and then we fight over it. In other words, complete catastrophe. On the other hand, there\u2019s another scenario where we get hold of our technologies, our social systems and our sense of law and justice and we make a kind of utopia\u200a\u2014\u200aa positive future where we\u2019re sustainable over the long haul. We could live on Earth in a permaculture that\u2019s beautiful. From this moment in history, both scenarios are completely conceivable.", "SP: Yet if we look at popular culture, dystopian and apocalyptic stories are everywhere. We don\u2019t see many positive visions of the\u00a0future.", "KSR: I\u2019ve always been involved with the positive visions of the future, so I would stubbornly insist that science fiction in general, and my work in particular, is about what could happen if we did things right. But right now, dystopia is big. It\u2019s good for movies because there are a lot of car crashes and things blowing\u00a0up.", "SP: Is it a problem that we have so many negative visions of the\u00a0future?", "Fear is a very intense and dramatic emotion. Hope is more fragile, but it\u2019s very stubborn and persistent.", "KSR: Dystopias express our fears and utopias express our hopes. Fear is a very intense and dramatic emotion. Hope is more fragile, but it\u2019s very stubborn and persistent. Hope is inherent in us getting up and eating breakfast every day. In the 1950s young people were thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to live on the moon. I will go to Neptune.\u201d Today it\u2019s The Hunger Games, which is a very important science fiction story. I like that it\u2019s science fiction, not fantasy. It\u2019s not Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. It\u2019s a very surrealistic and unsustainable future, but it\u2019s a vision of the fears of young people. They\u2019re pitting us against each other and we have to hang together because there\u2019s a rich elite, an oligarchy, that\u2019s simply eating our lives for their own entertainment. So there\u2019s a profound psychological and emotional truth in The Hunger\u00a0Games.", "There\u2019s a feeling of fear and political apprehension that late global capitalism is not fair. My Mars books\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough they\u2019re not as famous and haven\u2019t been turned into movies\u200a\u2014\u200aare quite popular because they\u2019re saying we could make a decent and beautiful civilization. I\u2019ve been noticing with great pleasure that my Mars trilogy is selling better now than it ever\u00a0has.", "SP: Does our society need positive visions of the future? Do we need people to create scenarios of how things could go\u00a0well?", "If science fiction doesn\u2019t provide those stories, people find them somewhere else. So Steve Jobs is a science fiction story we\u00a0want.", "KSR: Oh, yes. Ever since Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, we\u2019ve always had it. Edward Bellamy wrote a book called Looking Backward: 2000\u20131887. The progressive political movement that changed things around the time of Teddy Roosevelt came out of this novel. When people had to reconstruct the world\u2019s social order after World War II, they turned to H.G. Wells and A Modern Utopia and Men Like Gods. We always need utopias. These days, people are fascinated by Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. It\u2019s like those geeky 1950s science fiction stories where a kid in his backyard makes a rocket that goes to the moon. Now it\u2019s in his garage, where he makes a computer that changes everything. We love these stories because they\u2019re hopeful and they suggest that we could seize history and change it for the better. If science fiction doesn\u2019t provide those stories, people find them somewhere else.
