There is a wealth of readily available educational materials, and the industry\u2019s importance only continues to grow. That said, with so many easily accessible resources, choosing the right fit for your interests can be difficult. To help those considering entering the machine learning world, I\u2019d like to share my experience from two courses I took in 2017:<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\"> Coursera\u2019s Machine Learning course</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity\u2019s Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program</a>. I found both courses to be very instructive and worthwhile, but very different in nature. If you don\u2019t have time to take both then hopefully this post can help you decide which one is best for you."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Get hands-on learning from ML experts on Coursera "], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url": "https://hackernoon.com/", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://app.hackernoon.com/signup", "anchor_text": "Start Writing"}, {"url": "https://app.hackernoon.com/signup", "anchor_text": "LOGIN / SIGNUP"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/loganspears", "anchor_text": "@loganspears"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/archives/2018/01/25", "anchor_text": "January 25th 2018"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/company/amazon", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/company/youtube", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.imgix.net/hn-images/1*2UjSSQwW0bns1lPIuRxccQ.png", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/c/machine-learning", "anchor_text": "machine-learning"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/machine-learning", "anchor_text": "#machine-learning"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/udacity", "anchor_text": "#udacity"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ai", "anchor_text": "#ai"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/loganspears", "anchor_text": "@loganspears"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/loganspears", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/loganspears", "anchor_text": "@loganspears"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/loganspears", "anchor_text": "Read my stories"}, {"url": "https://bit.ly/3X8wXem", "anchor_text": "Get hands-on learning from ML experts on Coursera"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/youraimarketer", "anchor_text": "youraimarketer"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ai", "anchor_text": "#ai"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/youraimarketer", "anchor_text": "youraimarketer"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/tech-careers", "anchor_text": "#tech-careers"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/sheharyarkhan", "anchor_text": "sheharyarkhan"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/artificial-intelligence", "anchor_text": "#artificial-intelligence"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/alex-omeyer", "anchor_text": "alex-omeyer"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ai", "anchor_text": "#ai"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/u/IshanOnTech", "anchor_text": "IshanOnTech"}, {"url": "https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain", "anchor_text": "#blockchain"}]}, "scrape_status": {"code": "1"}}
