This helps both in collecting the data to train a more sophisticated model and acts as a good performance benchmark.", "This is followed by creating a train/validation/test dataset and training a model offline, So far, the model is not yet being used to make decisions impacting the end-user. Once we have a model, it\u2019s common practice to deploy it online and run A/B tests to compare it with the heuristic model. We follow a similar process when iterating on an existing machine learning model in production.", "One of the big challenges in this process is the validation of the offline model and deciding which model to try out online.", "These are some of the common questions which torment machine learning practitioners in their daily jobs, especially when building user-facing machine learning products. Some common scenarios behind these concerns are:", "In such scenarios, typical machine learning metrics like accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision-recall, etc. for individual models are generally not enough to tell whether an offline model is a significant improvement over the model in production. A/B tests are typically used for such evaluation, but they are expensive to run both in terms of cost and time.", "Counterfactual evaluation techniques, inspired by causal inference literature, provide a methodology of using production logs to estimate online metrics like click rate, revenue, etc. These act as good intermediate steps and help filter out offline models and select the right candidates for A/B testing, thus allowing us to explore a wide range of models offline.", "Let\u2019s take an example from the advertising world to understand this better.

All of this works because f(x) is fully defined, which is not the case in our problem (i.e. there is no way to know how a user would have interacted if a different ad would be shown).

This will allow us to simulate offline model predictions, use counterfactual estimation to get metrics and compare them with expected results.", "One way to do so is to set priors on the likelihood of picking the low/med/high ad using a vector [p_low, p_med, p_high] for a given context. We can intuitively say that the models with a higher likelihood of picking more performant ads for a context will work better. Note that this is not how an actual model would work because we wouldn\u2019t know the click rate prior; think of these as models that have learned these priors with different levels of accuracy.", "Here\u2019s a group of 10 models with increasing expected performance:", "For clarification, let\u2019s see this as a data frame:", "One nice feature of defining a model in this way is that we can actually calculate the expected click rate of each model. Since a model is a set of priors on picking a low/med/high ad, and we have already fixed the interaction rates of low/med/high ads, we can just take a dot product to estimate the click rate:", "We can see that expected click rates are in the order that we expect. Now we\u2019ll try to sample ad selections using each policy and use the counterfactual technique learned above to see if we can estimate these click rates using only the logged data and sampled outcomes from each model.", "First, let\u2019s use the propensity matching estimate:where:", "We can see that for each log entry we\u2019ve computed the ad selection from all new models.", "First, let\u2019s use the propensity matching estimate:", "We can see that for each log entry, we\u2019ve computed the probability of the same ad selection as a production model from all new models.", "We saw that in the case of both the estimators, we were able to estimate the right click rate for each model.
