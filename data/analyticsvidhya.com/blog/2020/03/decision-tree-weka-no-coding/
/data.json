It\u2019s not a cakewalk!", "Here\u2019s the good news \u2013 there are plenty of tools out there that let us perform machine learning tasks without having to code. You can easily build algorithms like decision trees from scratch in a beautiful graphical interface. Isn\u2019t that the dream? These tools, such as Weka, help us primarily deal with two things:", "This article will show you how to solve classification and regression problems using Decision Trees in Weka without any prior programming knowledge!", "But if you are passionate about getting your hands dirty with programming and machine learning, I suggest going through the following wonderfully curated courses:", "Let me first quickly summarize what classification and regression are in the context of machine learning. It\u2019s important to know these concepts before you dive into decision trees.", "A classification problem is about teaching your machine learning model how to categorize a data value into one of many classes. It does this by learning the characteristics of each type of class. For example, to predict whether an image is of a cat or dog, the model learns the characteristics of the dog and cat on training data.", "A regression problem is about teaching your machine learning model how to predict the future value of a continuous quantity. It does this by learning the pattern of the quantity in the past affected by different variables. For example, a model trying to predict the future share price of a company is a regression problem.", "You can find both these problems in abundance on our DataHack platform.", "Now, let\u2019s learn about an algorithm that solves both problems \u2013 decision trees!", "Decision trees are also known as Classification And Regression Trees (CART). They work by learning answers to a hierarchy of if/else questions leading to a decision. These questions form a tree-like structure, and hence the name.", "For example, let\u2019s say we want to predict whether a person will order food or not. We can visualize the following decision tree for this:", "Each node in the tree represents a question derived from the features present in your dataset. Your dataset is split based on these questions until the maximum depth of the tree is reached. The last node does not ask a question but represents which class the value belongs to.", "If you want to understand decision trees in detail, I suggest going through the below resources:", "\u201d Weka is a free open-source software with a range of built-in machine learning algorithms that you can access through a graphical user interface! \u201c", "WEKA stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis and was developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.", "Weka has multiple built-in functions for implementing a wide range of machine learning algorithms from linear regression to neural network. This allows you to deploy the most complex of algorithms on your dataset at just a click of a button! Not only this, Weka gives support for accessing some of the most common machine learning library algorithms of Python and R!", "With Weka you can preprocess the data, classify the data, cluster the data and even visualize the data! This you can do on different formats of data files like ARFF, CSV, C4.5, and JSON. Weka even allows you to add filters to your dataset through which you can normalize your data, standardize it, interchange features between nominal and numeric values, and what not!", "I could go on about the wonder that is Weka, but for the scope of this article let\u2019s try and explore Weka practically by creating a Decision tree. Now go ahead and download Weka from their official website!", "I will take the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I recommend you read about the problem before moving forward.", "Let us first load the dataset in Weka. To do that, follow the below steps:", "Your Weka window should now look like this:", "You can view all the features in your dataset on the left-hand side. Weka automatically creates plots for your features which you will notice as you navigate through your features.", "You can even view all the plots together if you click on the \u201cVisualize All\u201d button.", "Now let\u2019s train our classification model!", "Implementing a decision tree in Weka is pretty straightforward. Just complete the following steps:", "\u201cDecision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results in the most homogeneous sub-nodes.\u201d", "Information Gain is used to calculate the homogeneity of the sample at a split.", "You can select your target feature from the drop-down just above the \u201cStart\u201d button. If you don\u2019t do that, WEKA automatically selects the last feature as the target for you.", "The \u201cPercentage split\u201d specifies how much of your data you want to keep for training the classifier. The rest of the data is used during the testing phase to calculate the accuracy of the model.", "With \u201cCross-validation Fold\u201d you can create multiple samples (or folds) from the training dataset. If you decide to create N folds, then the model is iteratively run N times. And each time one of the folds is held back for validation while the remaining N-1 folds are used for training the model. The result of all the folds is averaged to give the result of cross-validation.", "The greater the number of cross-validation folds you use, the better your model will become. This makes the model train on randomly selected data which makes it more robust.", "Finally, press the \u201cStart\u201d button for the classifier to do its magic!", "Our classifier has got an accuracy of 92.4%. Weka even prints the Confusion matrix for you which gives different metrics. You can study about Confusion matrix and other metrics in detail here.", "Decision trees have a lot of parameters. We can tune these to improve our model\u2019s overall performance. This is where a working knowledge of decision trees really plays a crucial role.", "You can access these parameters by clicking on your decision tree algorithm on top:", "Let\u2019s briefly talk about the main parameters:", "You can always experiment with different values for these parameters to get the best accuracy on your dataset.", "Weka even allows you to easily visualize the decision tree built on your dataset:", "Your decision tree will look like below:", "Interpreting these values can be a bit intimidating but it\u2019s actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it.", "Like I said before, Decision trees are so versatile that they can work on classification as well as on regression problems. For this, I will use the \u201cPredict the number of upvotes\u201d problem from Analytics Vidhya\u2019s DataHack platform.", "Here, we need to predict the rating of a question asked by a user on a question and answer platform.", "As usual, we\u2019ll start by loading the data file. But this time, the data also contains an \u201cID\u201d column for each user in the dataset. This would not be useful in the prediction. So, we will remove this column by selecting the \u201cRemove\u201d option underneath the column names:", "We can make predictions on the dataset as we did for the Breast Cancer problem. RepTree will automatically detect the regression problem:", "The evaluation metric provided in the hackathon is the RMSE score. We can see that the model has a very poor RMSE without any feature engineering. This is where you step in \u2013 go ahead, experiment and boost the final model!", "And just like that, you have created a Decision tree model without having to do any programming!
