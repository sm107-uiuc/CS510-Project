You have various tools, but you ought to learn to use them at the right time. As an analogy, think of \u2018Linear Regression or Logistic Regression\u2019 as a sword capable of slicing and dicing data efficiently but incapable of dealing with highly complex data. Similarly, deep learning neural network is a lightsaber that can deal with any complex data. On the contrary, \u2018Support Vector Machines\u2019 or SVM, a machine learning algorithm, is like a sharp knife \u2013 it works on smaller datasets, but on them, it can be much stronger and more powerful in building models.", "This skill test was specially designed for you to test your knowledge of SVM, a supervised learning model, its techniques, and applications. These data science interview questions are useful for those of you wishing to grab a job as a data scientist. More than 550 people registered for the test. If you are one of those who missed out on this skill test, here are the questions and solutions.", "Here is the leaderboard\u00a0for the participants who took the test.", "Below is the distribution of the scores of the participants:", "\nYou can access the scores here. More than 350 people participated in the skill test and the highest score obtained was 25.", "There are plenty of courses and tutorials available online", "Here are some resources to get in-depth knowledge of the subject.", "If you are just getting started with Machine Learning and Data Science, here is a course to assist you in your journey to Master Data Science and Machine Learning models. Check out the detailed course structure in the link below:", "Suppose you are using a Linear SVM classifier with 2 class classification problem. Now you have been given the following data in which some points are circled red that represent support vectors.", "Explanation: These three examples are positioned such that removing any one of them introduces slack in the constraints. So the decision boundary would completely change.", "Explanation: On the other hand, the rest of the points in the data won\u2019t affect the decision boundary much.", "A) How far the hyperplane is from the support vectors\nB) How accurately the SVM can predict outcomes for unseen data\nC) The threshold amount of error in an SVM", "Explanation: Generalisation error in statistics is generally the out-of-sample error, which measures how accurately a model can predict values for previously unseen data.", "A) The optimal hyperplane, if exists, will be the one that completely separates the data\nB) The soft-margin classifier will separate the data\nC) None of the above", "Explanation: At such a high level of misclassification penalty, a soft margin will not hold existence as there will be no room for error.", "A) The SVM allows a very low error in classification\nB) The SVM allows a high amount of error in the classification\nC) None of the above", "Explanation: A hard margin means that an SVM is very rigid in classification and tries to work extremely well in the training set, causing overfitting.", "A) Large datasets\nB) Small datasets\nC) Medium-sized datasets\nD) Size does not matter", "Explanation: Datasets that have a clear classification boundary will function best with SVMs.", "A) Selection of Kernel trick\nB) Kernel Parameters\nC) Soft Margin Parameter C\nD) All of the above", "Explanation: The SVM effectiveness depends upon how you choose the basic 3 requirements mentioned above in such a way that it maximizes your efficiency and reduces error and overfitting.", "Explanation: They are the points closest to the hyperplane and the hardest ones to classify. They also have a direct bearing on the location of the decision surface.", "A) The data is linearly separable\nB) The data is clean and ready to use\nC) The data is noisy and contains overlapping points", "Explanation: When the data has noise and overlapping points, there is a problem in drawing a clear hyperplane without misclassifying.", "A) The model would consider even far away points from the hyperplane for modeling\nB) The model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for modeling\nC) The model would not be affected by the distance of points from the hyperplane for modeling\nD) None of the above", "Explanation: The gamma parameter in SVM tuning signifies the influence of points either near or far away from the hyperplane.", "For a low gamma, the model will be too constrained and include all points of the training dataset without really capturing the shape.", "For a higher gamma, the model will capture the shape of the dataset well.", "A) The number of cross-validations to be made\nB) The kernel to be used\nC) The tradeoff between misclassification and simplicity of the model\nD) None of the above", "Explanation: The cost parameter decides how much an SVM should be allowed to \u201cbend\u201d with the data. For a low cost, you aim for a smooth decision surface, and for a higher cost, you aim to classify more points correctly. It is also simply referred to as the cost of misclassification.", "Suppose you are building an SVM model on data X. The data X can be error-prone which means that you should not trust any specific data point too much.

After training SVM, you correctly infer that your SVM model is underfitting.", "A) You want to increase your data points\nB) You want to decrease your data points\nC) You will try to calculate more variables\nD) You will try to reduce the features", "Explanation: The best option here would be to create more features for the model.", "1. We are lowering the bias\n2. We are lowering the variance\n3. We are increasing the bias\n4. We are increasing the variance", "Explanation: Better model will lower the bias and increase the variance", "A) We will increase the parameter C\nB) We will decrease the parameter C\nC) Changing in C doesn\u2019t affect underfitting\nD) None of these", "Explanation: Increasing the C parameter would be the right thing to do here, as it will ensure regularize the model", "1. We do feature normalization so that new features will dominate others.\n2. Sometimes, feature normalization is not feasible in the case of categorical variables.\n3. Feature normalization always helps when we use the Gaussian kernel in SVM.", "Explanation: Statements one and two are correct.", "Suppose you are dealing with a 4-class classification problem, and you want to train an SVM model on the data. For that, you are using the One-vs-all method. Now answer the below questions.", "Explanation: For a 4-class problem, you would have to train the SVM at least 4 times if you are using a one-vs-all method.", "Explanation: Training the SVM only one time would give you appropriate results", "Suppose you are using SVM with a linear kernel of polynomial degree 2. Now think that you have applied this on data and found that it perfectly fits the data, which means the training and testing accuracy is 100%.", "A) Increasing the complexity will overfit the data\nB) Increasing the complexity will underfit the data\nC) Nothing will happen since your model was already 100% accurate\nD) None of these", "Explanation: Increasing the complexity of the data would make the algorithm overfit the data by having a highly non-linear boundary.", "1. Since data is fixed and we are fitting more polynomial terms or parameters, so the algorithm starts memorizing everything in the data.\n2. Since data is fixed and SVM doesn\u2019t need to search in big hypothesis space.", "Explanation: Both the given statements are correct.", "1. Kernel function map low dimensional input data to high dimensional space\n2. It\u2019s a similarity function", "Explanation: Both the given statements are correct.", "You have now covered 25 important Support Vector Machines (SVM) interview questions that I hope have helped increase your knowledge in the subject.
