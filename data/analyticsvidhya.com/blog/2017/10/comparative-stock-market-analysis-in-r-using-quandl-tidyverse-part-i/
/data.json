The same skill can be applied to many parallel domains. For example, I met some one who was doing the same thing with Cryptocurrency recently. Risk & Unemployment prediction in banks, customer churn in telecom and spend analysis are all examples of similar problems.", "That is why I decided to create this series of articles. By following this series, you will understand some of the techniques used in stock market. You can also apply them to the parallel domains I mentioned before.", "In the last article (Part I) , we started with descriptive analysis for comparison on stocks. In this post, we will emphasize on identifying patterns in order to know how a stock behaves. This behavior, as you will see later on, is very important for stock trading. In the latter part of the article, I will show how to predict stock prices using the conventional ARIMA (Auto-Regressive intensive Moving Average Method) methodology from Time Series Analysis and Regression Model.", "So lets get on with it!", "I will mention below the packages necessary to get on hands on in this article. Make sure you have them set up in your system before you continue.", "Perhaps the most important thing when you get into stock market trading is to know what Bollinger Bands are. In this section, I will mention what they are and how they were discovered.", "The Bollinger Band was introduce by John Bollinger in 1980s. These Bands depict the volatility of stock as it increases or decreases. The bands are placed above and below the moving average line of the stocks. The wider the gap between the bands, higher is the degree of volatility.", "On the other hand, as the width within the band decreases, lower is the degree of volatility of the stock. At times, the width within the band is constant over a period of time, which shows the constant behavior of a certain stock over that period of time.", "There are three lines in the Bollinger Band,", "Note: SMA is Simple Moving Average, Standard Deviation, K and N period is usually set at 20 days. The upper and lower band are placed 2 units above and below respectively.", "Below image is the typical example for Bollinger Band. This shows the volatility of Axis Bank stock for the period of 1 year from 1st September, 2016 to 1st September, 2017. The gap was higher in the months of September till December.", "In this section, we will discuss few aspects of Bollinger Band. This information can be used in different stock trading.", "The study will discuss the above points along with the identification of popular patterns like \u201cW \u2013 Bottoms\u201d & \u201cM \u2013 Tops\u201d in Bollinger band.", "We will keep the data clean with tidyverse. In this section we will first download the data with the help of Quandl package and then manipulate the dataframe with tidyverse to get our desired dataset,", "If you haven\u2019t gone through this in my previous post on\u00a0Comparative Stock Analysis Vol-I , lets setup up the Quandl API", "There are patterns which are usualy seen in stock market data. These patterns (or signals) help us identify the behavior of stocks. Let us quickly understand the two most popular ones (W-Bottoms and M-Tops)", "A \u201cW-Bottom\u201d forms in a downtrend and involves two reaction lows. In particular, Bollinger looks for W-Bottoms where the second low is lower than the first but holds above the lower band. There are four steps to confirm Bollinger \u201cW \u2013 Bottoms\u201d,", "Below image is the \u201cW-Bottoms\u201d identification for BOB (Bank of Baroda). Both of the W-Bottoms are followed by strong northward move in February and May, 2017 respectively.", "An M-Top is similar to a double top. M-Tops are reversal signals from upward trend into a downward trend. The first high can be higher or lower than the second high. Initially there is a wave higher, which gets close to or move above the upper band. Then price will move downward to middle band and then continues northward journey, might or might not touch the upper band (at times it goes above the previous high) and then does not close above the upper band.", "Bollinger suggests looking for signs of non-confirmation when a security is making new highs.A non-confirmation occurs with three steps.", "Below is the image for MTOPS signal for SBI (State Bank Of India) stock in NSE over the period of one year starting from 1st sept, 2016 to 1st sept, 2017. Each of the MTops are followed by decline in prices in the months of Nov-Dec, May and August.", "If you want to get more information on the Bollinger Band and related identification patterns. Below are the links to the resources,", "Let us visualize the volatility (gap between the upper and lower band) and also try to identify the patterns / signals in our six selected bank stocks.", "In this section, we will predict the prices for two selected bank PNB and Axis Bank. In stock market, generally the prices are dynamic and depends on various factors like news, weather, public policy, interest rate. It is difficult to predict the stock price behavior as it depends on lots of factor. In order to get more accuracy in prediction, we\u2019ve used two different approach to come to prediction.", "In the last post, we have seen that the stock prices is also dependent on the traded quantity, but direction can be either ways. In our analysis, we will take consideration of these movements. We will also analyze the random part of the stock price movement, so called white noise and will include in our prediction model.", "There is also available study on white noise on Analytics Vidhya by Tavish Srivastava.", "The following points are the steps to arrive at Predictions", "Note: ggplot shows the prediction and actual prices. Predcition prices has the band for lower and upper limit.", "In this article, I have focused on Predictive Analysis of bank stocks. I have summarized a bit on Bollinger Bands, which probably is the most important topic in stock analysis. I have also walked you through the volatility of bank stocks and ways to see through this volatility.", "This ends our journey of comparative analysis of stock market data. I hope it will help you to make your mark in the world of stocks. Good Luck!", "Aritra Chatterjee is a professional in the field of Data Science and Operation Management having experience of more than 5 years.
