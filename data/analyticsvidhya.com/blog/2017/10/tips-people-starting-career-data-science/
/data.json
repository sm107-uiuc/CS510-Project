A difficult question which one faces in getting hands-on is which language/tool should you choose?", "This would probably be the most asked question by beginners. The most straightforward answer would be to choose any of the mainstream tools/languages there is and start your data science journey. After all, tools are just a means for implementation; but understanding the concept is more important.", "Still, the question remains, which would be a better option to start with? There are various guides/discussions on the internet which address this particular query. The gist is that start with the simplest of language or the one with which you are most familiar. if you are not as well versed with coding, you should prefer GUI based tools for now. Then as you get a grasp on the concepts, you can get your hands-on with the coding part.", "You can learn Python for Data Science here.", "Now that you know which role you want to opt for and are getting prepared for it, the next important thing for you to do would be to join a peer group.
