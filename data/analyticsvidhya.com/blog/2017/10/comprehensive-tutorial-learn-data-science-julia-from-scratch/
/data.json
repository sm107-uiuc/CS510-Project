Runs like C.\u201d", "The above line tells a lot about why I chose to write this article. I came across Julia a while ago even though it was in its early stages, it was still creating ripples in the numerical computing space. Julia is a work straight out of MIT, a high-level language that has a syntax as friendly as Python and performance as competitive as C. This is not all,\u00a0\u00a0It provides a sophisticated compiler,\u00a0distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an\u00a0extensive mathematical function library.", "But this article isn\u2019t about praising Julia, it is about how can you utilize it in your workflow as a data scientist without going through hours of confusion which usually comes when we come across a new language. Read more about Why Julia? here.", "Before we can start our journey into the world of Julia, we need to set up our environment with the necessary tools and libraries for data science.", "Jupyter notebook has become an environment of choice for data science since it is really useful for both fast experimenting and documenting your steps. There are other environments too for Julia like  Juno IDE  but I recommend to stick with the notebook. Let\u2019s look at how we can setup the same for Julia.", "Go to the Julia prompt and type the following code", "Note\u00a0that Pkg.add() command downloads files and package dependencies in the background and installs it for you. For this, you should have an active internet connection. If your internet is slow, you might have to wait for some time.", "After ijulia is successfully installed you can type the following code to run it,", "By default, the notebook \u201cdashboard\u201d opens in your home directory ( homedir() ), but you can open the dashboard in a different directory with notebook(dir=\u201d/some/path\u201d) .", "There you have your environment all set up. Let\u2019s install some important Julia libraries that we\u2019d be needing for this tutorial.", "A simple way of installing any package in Julia is using the command Pkg.add(\u201c..\u201d). Like Python or R, Julia too has a long list of packages for data science. I thought instead of installing all the packages together it would be better if we install them as and when needed, that\u2019d give you a good sense of what each package does. So we will be following that process for this article.", "Julia is a language that derives a lot of syntax from other data analysis tools like R, Python, and MATLAB. If you are from one of these backgrounds, it would take you no time to get started with it. Let\u2019s learn some of the basic syntaxes. If you are in a hurry here\u2019s a cheat sheet comparing syntax of all the three languages:", "There, you created your first Julia notebook! Just like you use jupyter notebook for R or Python, you can write Julia code here, train your models, make plots and so much more all while being in the familiar environment of jupyter.", "Go ahead and play around a bit with the notebook to get familiar.", "The following are some of the most common data structures we end up using when performing data analysis on Julia:", "Note that in Julia the indexing starts from 1, so if you want to access the first element of an array you\u2019ll do A[1].", "Notice that \u201c=>\u201d operator is used to link key with their respective values. You access the values of the dictionary using its key.", "Like most languages, Julia also has a FOR-loop which is the most widely used method for iteration. It has a simple syntax:", "Here \u201cJulia Iterable\u201d can be a vector, string or other advanced data structures which we will explore in later sections.

Yes, I mean making a predictive model! In the process, we use some powerful libraries and also come across the next level of data structures. We will take you through the 3 key phases:", "The first step in any kind of data analysis is exploring the dataset at hand. There are two ways to do that, the first is exploring the data tables and applying statistical methods to find patterns in numbers and the second is plotting the data to find patterns visually.", "The former requires an advanced data structure that is capable of handling multiple operations and at the same time is fast and scalable. Like many other data analysis tools, Julia provides one such structure called DataFrame. You need to install the following package for using it:", "A dataframe is similar to Excel workbook \u2013 you have column names referring to columns and you have rows, which can be accessed with the use of row numbers. The essential difference is that column names and row numbers are known as column and row index, in case of dataframes .

The frequency table can be printed by the following command:", "Similarly, we can look at unique values of credit history. Note that dataframe_name[:column_name] is a basic indexing technique to access a particular column of the dataframe. A column can also be accessed by its index.

In order to use this functionality you need to install the following package:", "The package \u201cPlots.jl\u201d provides a single frontend(interface) for any plotting library(matplotlib, plotly, etc.) you want to use in Julia. \u201cStatPlots.jl\u201d is a supporting package used for Plots.jl. \u201cPyPlot.jl\u201d is used to work with matplotlib of Python in Julia.", "Now that we are familiar with basic data characteristics, let us study the distribution of various variables. Let us start with numeric variables \u2013 namely ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount", "Let\u2019s start by plotting the histogram of ApplicantIncome using the following commands:", "Here we observe that there are few extreme values. This is also the reason why 50 bins are required to depict the distribution clearly.", "Next, we look at box plots to understand the distributions. Box plot for fare can be plotted by:", "This confirms the presence of a lot of outliers/extreme values. This can be attributed to the income disparity in the society. Part of this can be driven by the fact that we are looking at people with different education levels. Let us segregate them by Education:", "We can see that there is no substantial difference between the mean income of graduate and non-graduates. But there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, which are appearing to be the outliers.", "Now, Let\u2019s look at the histogram and boxplot of LoanAmount using the following command:", "Again, there are some extreme values. Clearly, both ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount require some amount of data munging. LoanAmount has missing and well as extreme values, while ApplicantIncome has a few extreme values, which demand deeper understanding. We will take this up in coming sections.", "That was a lot of useful visualizations, to learn more about creating visualizations in Julia using Plots.jl Plots.jl Documentation", "Now\u2019s the time where awesomeness of Plots.jl comes into play. The visualizations we created till now were all good but while exploration it is useful if the plot is interactive. We can create interactive plots in Julia using Plotly as a backend.

Read Plots.jl Documentation \ud83d\ude42", "For those, who have been following, here you must wear your shoes to start running.", "While our exploration of the data, we found a few problems in the data set, which needs to be solved before the data is ready for a good model. This exercise is typically referred as \u201cData Munging\u201d. Here are the problems, we are already aware of:", "In addition to these problems with numerical fields, we should also look at the non-numerical fields i.e. Gender, Property_Area, Married, Education and Dependents to see, if they contain any useful information.", "Let us look at missing values in all the variables because most of the models don\u2019t work with missing data and even if they do, imputing them helps more often than not. So, let us check the number of nulls / NaNs in the dataset", "Though the missing values are not very high in number, many variables have them and each one of these should be estimated and added to the data.", "Note: Remember that missing values may not always be NaNs. For instance, if the Loan_Amount_Term is 0, does it makes sense or would you consider that missing? I suppose your answer is missing and you\u2019re right. So we should check for values which are unpractical.", "There are multiple ways of fixing missing values in a dataset. Take LoanAmount for example, there are numerous ways to fill the missing values \u2013 the simplest being replacement by the mean.", "The other extreme would be to build a supervised learning model to predict loan amount on the basis of other variables and then use age along with other variables to predict survival.", "We would be taking the simpler approach to fix missing values in this article:", "I have basically replaced all missing values in numerical columns with their means and with the mode in categorical columns. Let\u2019s understand the code little closely,", "I hope this gives you a better understanding of the code part that is used to fix missing values.", "As discussed earlier, there are better ways to perform data imputation and I encourage you to learn as many as you can. Get a detailed view of different imputation techniques through  this article  .", "Now that we have fixed all missing values, we will be building a predictive machine learning model. We will also be cross-validating it and saving it to the disk for future use. The following packages are required for doing so:", "This package is an interface to Python\u2019s scikit-learn package so python users are in for a treat. The interesting thing about using this package is you get to use the same models and functionality as you used in Python.", "Sklearn requires all data to be of numeric type so let\u2019s label encode our data,", "Those who have used sklearn before will find this code to be familiar, we are using LabelEncoder to encode the categories. I have used the index of columns with categorical data.", "Next, we will import the required modules. Then we will define a generic classification function, which takes a model as input and determines the Accuracy and Cross-Validation scores. Since this is an introductory article and julia code is very similar to python, I will not go into the details of coding. Please refer to  this article  for getting details of the algorithms with R and Python codes. Also, it\u2019ll be good to get a refresher on cross-validation through  this article  , as it is a very important measure of power performance.", "Let\u2019s make our first Logistic Regression model. One way would be to take all the variables into the model but this might result in overfitting (don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re unaware of this terminology yet). In simple words, taking all variables might result in the model understanding complex relations specific to the data and will not generalize well.

The chances of getting a loan will be higher for:", "So let\u2019s make our first model with \u2018Credit_History\u2019.", "Generally, we expect the accuracy to increase by adding variables. But this is a more challenging case. The accuracy and cross-validation score are not getting impacted by less important variables. Credit_History is dominating the mode. We have two options now:", "A decision tree is another method for making a predictive model. It is known to provide higher accuracy than logistic regression model. Read more about\u00a0Decision Trees.", "Here the model based on categorical variables is unable to have an impact because Credit History is dominating over them. Let\u2019s try a few numerical variables:", "Here we observed that although the accuracy went up on adding variables, the cross-validation error went down. This is the result of model over-fitting the data. Let\u2019s try an even more sophisticated algorithm and see if it helps:", "Random forest is another algorithm for solving the classification problem.\u00a0Read more about\u00a0Random Forest.", "An advantage with Random Forest is that we can make it work with all the features and it returns a feature importance matrix which can be used to select features.", "Here we see that the accuracy is 100% for the training set. This is the ultimate case of overfitting and can be resolved in two ways:", "The updated code would now be", "Notice that although accuracy reduced, the cross-validation score is improving showing that the model is generalizing well. Remember that random forest models are not exactly repeatable. Different runs will result in slight variations because of randomization. But the output should stay in the ballpark.", "You would have noticed that even after some basic parameter tuning on the random forest, we have reached a cross-validation accuracy only slightly better than the original logistic regression model. This exercise gives us some very interesting and unique learning:", "So are you ready to take on the challenge? Start your data science journey with\u00a0Loan Prediction Problem.", "Julia is a powerful language with interesting libraries but it may so happen that you want to use library of your own from outside Julia. One such reason can be lack of functionality in existing Julia libraries(it is still very young). For situations like this, Julia provides ways to call libraries from R and Python. Let\u2019s see how can we do that?", "There is something interesting about using a Python library as smoothly in another language.", "Pandas is a very mature and performant library, it is certainly a bliss that we can use it wherever the native DataFrames.jl falls short.", "I hope this tutorial will help\u00a0you maximize your efficiency when starting with data science in Julia. I am sure this not only gave you an idea about\u00a0basic data analysis methods but it also showed you how to implement some of the more sophisticated techniques available today.", "Julia is really a great tool and is becoming an increasingly popular language among the data scientists. The reason being, it\u2019s easy to learn, integrates well with other tools, gives C like speed and also allows using libraries of existing tools like R and Python.", "So, learn Julia to perform the full life-cycle of any data science project.
