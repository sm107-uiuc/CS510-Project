This article explains in detail about how Gradient Descent works, the problems in the original Gradient Descent and the variants of Gradient Descent for overcoming the problem along with the implementation.", "An operations manager working at a Supermarket chain in India knows about the amount of preparation the store chain needs to do before the Indian festive season (Diwali) kicks in. It is for them to estimate/predict which product will sell like hotcakes and which would not prior to the purchase. A bad decision can leave your customers to look for offers and products in the competitor stores. The challenge does not finish there \u2013 he also needs to estimate the sales of products across a range of different categories for stores in varied locations and with consumers having different consumption techniques. This article tells you everything you need to know about regression models and how they can be used to solve prediction problems like the one mentioned above.", "There are many libraries out in the industry which provides methods for exploiting the text data to make sense out of it. Some of the examples being like Stanford CoreNLP, NLTK etc. and Python has been the go-to choice for working with text data.", "But these libraries lacking in the sense that they are bulky and with too much overhead like NLTK which downloads thousands and thousands of files for performing any NLP task.", "This is where SpaCy comes in \u2013 an industrial grade superfast NLP library which can perform almost all the NLP tasks with the breeze.
