Machine Learning models are increasing in popularity and are now being used to solve a wide variety of business problems using data. Having said that, it is also true that there is always a trade-off between accuracy of models & its interpretability.", "In general, if accuracy has to be improved, data scientists have to resort to using complicated algorithms like Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests etc. which are \u201cBlackbox\u201d methods. It is no wonder that many of the winning entries in Kaggle or Analytics Vidhya competitions tend to use algorithms like XGBoost, where there is no requirement to explain the process of generating the predictions to a business user. \u00a0On the other hand, in a business setting, simpler models that are more interpretable like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc. are used even if the predictions are less accurate.", "This situation has got to change \u2013 the trade-off between accuracy & interpretability is not acceptable. We need to find ways to use powerful black-box algorithms even in a business setting and still be able to explain the logic behind the predictions intuitively to a business user. With increased trust in predictions, organisations will deploy machine learning models more extensively within the enterprise. The question is \u2013 \u201cHow do we build trust in Machine Learning Models\u201d?", "It is in this context, I find the paper titled \u201cWhy Should I Trust You?\u201d- Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier [1] intriguing & interesting. In this paper [1] , the authors explain a framework called LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), which is an algorithm that can explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor in a faithful way, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. \u00a0In the paper, there are many examples of problems where the predictions from black-box algorithms (even as extreme as Deep Learning) can be formulated in an interpretable fashion. I am not going to explain the paper in this blog but rather show how it can be implemented in our own classification problems.", "Sigma Cab\u2019s Surge Pricing Type Classification", "In February this year, Analytics Vidhya ran a machine learning competition in which the objective was to predict the \u201cSurge Pricing Type\u201d for Sigma Cab \u2013 a taxi aggregation service. This was a multiclass classification problem. In this blog, we will see how to make predictions for this dataset and use LIME to make the predictions interpretable.

Both Logistic Regression & XGBoost predicts that type 2 has a higher probability. Also, when you look at the NOT 2 | 2 table, you can see the weights assigned by different algorithms to each feature. For example, Trip Distance > 0.35 is assigned a weight of 0.01 in the case of Logistic Regression, a weight of 0.02 in the case of Random Forest and 0.01 in the case of Xgboost. Each feature is then color-coded to indicate whether it is contributing to the prediction of 2 (Orange) or NOT 2 (Grey) in the feature-value-table. The Feature-Value table by itself shows the actual values of the features for that particular record (in this case Id = 45)", "(Note: The visualisation is not powerful enough to show the feature weights for all classes in a multi-class scenario but the same process is applicable to differentiate between class 1 & 3 also)", "The probability values for each class is different for each algorithm as the feature weights computed by each algorithm are different. Depending on the actual value of the features for a particular record and the weights assigned to those features, the algorithm computes the class probability and then predicts the class having the highest probability. These results can be interpreted by a subject matter expert to see which algorithm is picking up the right signals / features to make the prediction. Essentially, the black box algorithms have become white box in the sense that now we know what drives the algorithms to make its predictions.", "Here\u2019s the whole code for your reference", "I hope you are as excited as me after looking at these results. The output of LIME provides an intuition into the inner workings of machine learning algorithms as to the features that are being used to arrive at a prediction. If LIME or similar algorithms can help in providing interpretable output for any type of blackbox algorithm, it will go a long way in getting the buy-in from business users to trust the output of machine learning algorithms. By building such trust, powerful methods can be deployed in a business context achieving the twin benefits of higher accuracy and interpretability.
