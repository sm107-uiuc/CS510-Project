People don\u2019t realize the wide variety of machine learning problems which can exist.", "I, on the other hand, love exploring different variety of problems and sharing my learning with the community here.", "Previously, I\u00a0shared my learnings on Genetic algorithms with the community. Continuing on with my search, I intend to cover a topic which has much less widespread but a nagging problem in the data science community \u2013 which is multi-label classification.", "In this article, I will give you an intuitive explanation of what multi-label classification entails, along with illustration of how to solve the problem. I hope it will show you the horizon of what data science encompasses. So lets get on with it!", "Let us take a look at the image below.", "What if I ask you that does this image contains a house? The option will be YES or NO. ", "Consider another case, like what all things (or labels) are relevant to this picture? ", "These types of problems, where we have a set of target variables, are known as\u00a0multi-label classification problems. So, is there any difference between these two cases? Clearly, yes because in the second case any image may contain a different set of these multiple labels for different images.", "But before going deep into multi-label, I just wanted to clear one thing as many of you might be confused that how this is different from the multi-class problem. ", "So, let\u2019s us try to understand the difference between these two sets of problems. ", "Consider an example to understand the difference between these two. For this, I hope that below image makes things quite clear. Let\u2019s try to understand it. ", "For any movie, Central Board of Film Certification, issue a certificate depending on the contents of the movie. \u00a0", "For example, if you look above, this movie has been rated as \u2018U/A\u2019 (meaning \u2018Parental Guidance for children below the age of 12 years\u2019) certificate. There are other types of certificates classes like \u2018A\u2019 (Restricted to adults) or \u2018U\u2019 (Unrestricted Public Exhibition), but it is sure that each movie can only be categorized with only one out of those three type of certificates. \u00a0", "In short, there are multiple categories but each instance is assigned only one, therefore such problems are known as multi-class classification problem. ", "Again, if you look back at the image, this movie has been categorized into comedy and romance genre. But there is a difference that this time each movie could fall into one or more different sets of categories. \u00a0", "Therefore, each instance can be assigned with multiple categories, so these types of problems are known as multi-label classification problem, where we have a set of target labels. ", "Great! Now you can distinguish between a multi-label and multi-class problem. So, let\u2019s start how to deal with these types of problems. ", "Scikit-learn has provided a separate library scikit-multilearn for multi label classification. ", "For better understanding, let us start practicing on a multi-label dataset. You can find a real-world data set from the repository provided by MULAN package. These datasets are present in ARFF format. ", "So, for getting started with any of these datasets, look at the python code below for loading it onto your jupyter notebook. Here I have downloaded the yeast data set from the repository.", "There is how the data set looks like.", "Here, Att represents the attributes or the independent variables and Class represents the target variables.", "For practice purpose, we have another option to generate an artificial multi-label dataset. \u00a0", "Let us understand the parameters used above. ", "sparse: If True, returns a sparse matrix, where sparse matrix means a matrix having a large number of zero elements. ", "n_labels: \u00a0The average number of labels for each instance. ", "return_indicator: If \u2018sparse\u2019 return Y in the sparse binary indicator format.", "allow_unlabeled: If True, some instances might not belong to any class.", "You must have noticed that we have used sparse matrix everywhere, and scikit-multilearn also recommends to use data in the sparse form because it is very rare for a real-world data set to be dense. Generally, the number of labels assigned to each instance is very less.", "Okay, now we have our datasets ready so let us quickly learn the techniques to solve a multi-label problem.", "Basically, there are three methods to solve a multi-label classification problem, namely: ", "In this method, we will try to transform our multi-label problem into single-label problem(s). ", "This method can be carried out in three different ways as: ", "This is the simplest technique, which basically treats each label as a separate single class classification problem. ", "For example, let us consider a case as shown below. We have the data set like this, where X is the independent feature and Y\u2019s are the target variable.\n", "In binary relevance, this problem is broken into 4 different single class classification problems as shown in the figure below.", "We don\u2019t have to do this manually, the multi-learn library provides its implementation in python. So, let\u2019s us quickly look at its implementation on the randomly generated data.", "NOTE: Here, we have used Naive Bayes algorithm but you can use any other classification algorithm.", "Now, in a multi-label classification problem, we can\u2019t simply use our normal metrics to calculate the accuracy of our predictions. For that purpose, we will use accuracy score metric. This function calculates subset accuracy meaning the predicted set of labels should exactly match with the true set of labels.", "So, let us calculate the accuracy of the predictions.", "It is most simple and efficient method but the only drawback of this method is that it doesn\u2019t consider labels correlation because it treats every target variable independently.", "In this, the first classifier is trained just on the input data and then each next classifier is trained on the input space and all the previous classifiers in the chain. \u00a0", "Let\u2019s try to this understand this by an example. In the dataset given below, we have X as the input space and Y\u2019s as the labels.", "In classifier chains, this problem would be transformed into 4 different single label problems, just like shown below. Here yellow colored is the input space and the white part represent the target variable.", "This is quite similar to binary relevance, the only difference being it forms chains in order to preserve label correlation. So, let\u2019s try to implement this using multi-learn library.", "We can see that using this we obtained an accuracy of about 21%, which is very less than binary relevance. This is maybe due to the absence of label correlation since we have randomly generated the data. ", "In this, we transform the problem into a multi-class problem with one multi-class classifier is trained on all unique label combinations found in the training data. ", "Let\u2019s understand it by an example.", "In this, we find that x1 and x4 have the same labels, similarly, x3 and x6 have the same set of labels. So, label powerset transforms this problem into a single multi-class problem as shown below. ", "So, label powerset has given a unique class to every possible label combination that is present in the training set. ", "Let\u2019s us look at its implementation in python. ", "This gives us the highest accuracy among all the three we have discussed till now. The only disadvantage of this is that as the training data increases, number of classes become more. Thus, increasing the model complexity, and would result in a lower accuracy. ", "Now, let us look at the second method to solve multi-label classification problem. ", "Adapted algorithm, as the name suggests, adapting the algorithm to directly perform multi-label classification, rather than transforming the problem into different subsets of problems. ", "For example, multi-label version of kNN is represented by MLkNN. So, let us quickly implement this on our randomly generated data set. ", "Great! You have achieved an accuracy score of 69% on your test data. ", "Sci-kit learn provides inbuilt support of multi-label classification in some of the algorithm like Random Forest and Ridge regression. So, you can directly call them and predict the output. ", "You can check the multi-learn library if you wish to learn more about other types of adapted algorithm. ", "Ensemble always produces better results. Scikit-Multilearn library provides different ensembling classification functions, which you can use for obtaining better results. ", "For the direct implementation, you can check out here. ", "Multi-label classification problems are very common in the real world. So, let us look at some of the areas where we can find the use of them.", "We have already seen songs being classified into different genres. They are also been classified on the basis of emotions or moods like \u201crelaxing-calm\u201d, or \u201csad-lonely\u201d etc. ", "Multi-label classification using image has also a wide range of applications. Images can be labeled to indicate different objects, people or concepts.", "Multi-Label classification has a lot of use in the field of bioinformatics, for example, classification of genes in the yeast data set.", "It is also used to predict multiple functions of proteins using several unlabeled proteins. You can check this paper for more information.", "You all must once check out google news. So, what google news does is, it labels every news to one or more categories such that it is displayed under different categories. For example, take a look at the image below.", "That same news is present under the categories of India, Technology, Latest etc. because it has been classified into these different labels. Thus making it a multi label classification problem.", "There are plenty of other areas, so explore and comment down below if you wish to share it with the community. ", "In this article, I introduced you to the concept of multi-label classification problems.
