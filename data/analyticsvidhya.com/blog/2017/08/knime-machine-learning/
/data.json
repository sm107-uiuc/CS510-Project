Especially so, if you do not know how to code. You need to quickly get used to Linear Algebra, Statistics, other mathematical concepts and learn how to code them! It might end up being a bit overwhelming for the new users.", "If you have no background in coding and find it difficult to cope with, you can start learning data science with a tool which is GUI driven. This enables you to focus your efforts on learning the subject in initial days. Once you are comfortable with basic concepts, you can always learn how to code later on.", "In today\u2019s article, I will get you started with one such GUI based tool \u2013 KNIME. By end of this article, you will be able to predict sales for a retail store without writing a piece of code!", "KNIME is a platform built for powerful analytics on a GUI based workflow.

It can do a number of actions based on what you choose in your workflow.", "Workflow: A workflow is the sequence of steps or actions you take in your platform to accomplish a particular task.", "The workflow coach on the left top corner will show you what percentage of the community of KNIME recommends a particular node for usage. The node repository will display all nodes that a particular workflow can have, depending on your needs.

[I chose 3000]\nClick execute, and then View: Scatter Plot.\n\nI have selected the X axis to be Item_Type and the Y axis to be Item_Outlet_Sales.\nThe plot above represents the sales of each item type individually, and shows us that fruits and vegetables are sold in the highest numbers.\n\nPie Chart\n\nTo understand an average sales estimate of all product types in our database, we will use a pie chart.\n\nClick on the Pie Chart node under Views and connect it to your File Reader. Choose the columns you need for segregation and choose your preferred aggregation methods, then apply.\nThis chart shows us that sales were averagely divided over all kinds of products. \u201cStarchy Foods\u201d amassed the highest average sales of 7.7%.\nI have used only two types of visuals although you can explore the data in numerous forms while you browse through the \u201cViews\u201d tab. You can use histograms, line plots etc. to better visualize your data.\n\u00a0\n3. How do you clean your Data?\nThe other things you can include in your approach before training your model are Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction. Here I will cover an overview of data cleaning steps in KNIME. For further understanding, follow this article on Data Exploration and Feature Engineering.\n\u00a0\n3.1 Finding Missing Values\nBefore we impute values, we need to know which ones are missing.\nGo to the node repository again, and find the node \u201cMissing Values\u201d. Drag and drop it, and connect the output of our File Reader to the node.\n\n\u00a0\n3.2 Imputations\nTo impute values, select the node Missing Value and click configure. Select the appropriate imputations you want for your data depending on the type of data it is, and \u201cApply\u201d.\n\nNow when we execute it, our complete dataset with imputed values is ready in the output port of the node \u201cMissing Value\u201d. For my analysis, I have chosen the imputation methods as:\nString: Most Frequent Value\nNumber (Double): Median\nNumber (Integer): Median\nYou can choose from a variety of imputation techniques such as:\nString: \n\nNext Value\nPrevious Value\nCustom Value\nRemove Row\n\nNumber (Double and Integer):\n\nMean\nMedian\nPrevious Value\nNext Value\nCustom Value\nLinear Interpolation\nMoving Average\n\n\u00a0\n4. Training your First Model\nLet us take a look at how we would build a machine learning model in KNIME.\n\u00a0\n4.1 Implementing a Linear Model\nTo start with the basics, we will first train a Linear Model encompassing all the features of the dataset just to understand how to select features and build a model.\nGo to your node repository and drag the \u201cLinear Regression Learner\u201d to your workflow. Then connect the clean data that you gathered in the \u201cOutput Port\u201d of the \u201cMissing Value\u201d node.\n\nThis should be your screen visual as of now. In the configuration tab, exclude the Item_Identifier and select the target variable on top. After you complete this task, you need to import your Test data to run your model.\nDrag and drop another file reader to your workflow and select the test data from your system.\n\nAs we can see, the Test data contains missing values as well. We will run it through the \u201cMissing Value\u201d node in the same way we did for the Training data.\nAfter we\u2019ve cleaned our Test data as well, we will now introduce a new node \u201cRegression Predictor\u201d.\n\nLoad your Model into the predictor by connecting the learner\u2019s output to the predictor\u2019s input. In the predictor\u2019s second input, load your test data. The predictor will automatically adjust the prediction column based on your learner, but you can alter it manually as well.\nKNIME has the capability to train some very specialised models as well under the \u201cAnalytics\u201d tab. Here is an in-exhaustive list\n\nClustering\nNeural Networks\nEnsemble Learners\nNa\u00efve Bayes\n\n\u00a0\n5. Submitting your Solution\nAfter you execute your predictor now, the output is almost ready for submission.\nFind the node \u201cColumn Filter\u201d in your node repository and drag it to your workflow. Connect the output of your predictor to the column filter and configure it to filter out the columns you need. In this case, you need Item_Identifier, Outlet_Identifier and the Prediction of Outlet_Sales.\n\nExecute the \u201cColumn Filter\u201d and finally, search for the node \u201cCSV Writer\u201d and document your predictions on your hard drive.\n\nAdjust the path to set it where you want the .csv file stored, and execute this node. Finally, open the .csv file to correct the column names as according to our solution. Compress the .csv file into a .zip file and submit your solution!\n\nThis is the final workflow diagram that was obtained.\nKNIME workflows are very handy when it comes to portability. They can be sent to your friends or colleagues to build on together, adding to the functionality of your product!\nTo export a KNIME workflow, you can simply click on File -> Export KNIME Workflow\n\nAfter that, select the suitable workflow that you need to export and click finish!\n\nThis will create a .knwf file that you can send across to anyone and they will be able to access it with one click!\n\u00a0\n6. Limitations\nKNIME being a very powerful open source tool, has its own set of limitations. The primary ones being:\n\nThe visualisations are not as neat and polished as some other open source softwares. (Ex: RStudio)\nVersion updates are not supported well, you will have to reinstall the software. (Ex: For updating KNIME from version 2 to version 3, you will need a fresh installation and updating won\u2019t work. )\nThe contributing community is not as large as Python or CRAN communities, so it takes a long time for new additions to KNIME.\n\n\u00a0\nEnd Notes\nKNIME is a platform that can be used for almost any kind of analysis. In this article, we explored how to visualise a dataset and extract important features from it. Predictive modelling was undertaken as well, using a linear regression predictor to estimate sales for each item accordingly. Finally, we filtered out the required columns and exported it to a .csv file.\nHope this tutorial has helped you uncover aspects of the problem that you might have overlooked before. It is very important to understand the data science pipeline and the steps we take to train a model, and this should surely help you build better predictive models soon.
