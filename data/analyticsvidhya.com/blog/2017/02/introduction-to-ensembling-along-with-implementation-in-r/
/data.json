After the competition, I always make sure to go through the winner\u2019s solution. The winner\u2019s solution usually provide me critical insights, which have helped me immensely in future competitions.", "Most of the winners rely on an ensemble of well-tuned individual models along with feature engineering. If you are starting with machine learning, I would advise you to lay emphasis on these two areas as\u00a0I have found them equally important to\u00a0do well in a machine learning.", "Most of the time, I was able to crack the feature engineering part but probably didn\u2019t use the ensemble of multiple models.\u00a0If you are a beginner, it\u2019s even better to get familiar with ensembling as early as possible. Chances are that you are already applying it without knowing!", "In this article, I\u2019ll take you through the basics of ensemble modeling. Then I will walk you through the advantages of ensembling. Also, to provide you\u00a0hands-on experience on ensemble modeling, we will use ensembling on a hackathon problem using R.", "P.S. For this article, we will assume that you can build individual models in R / Python. If not, you can start your journey with our learning path.", "In general, ensembling is a technique of combining two or more algorithms of similar or dissimilar types called base learners. This is done to make a more robust system which incorporates the predictions from all the base learners. It can be understood as conference room meeting between multiple traders to make a decision on whether the price of a stock will go up or not.", "Since all of them have a different understanding of the stock market and thus a different mapping function from the problem statement to the desired outcome. Therefore, they are supposed to make varied predictions on the stock price based on their own understandings of the market.", "Now we can take all of these predictions into account while making the final decision. This will make our final decision more robust, accurate and less likely to be biased. The final decision would have been opposite if one of these traders would have made this decision alone.", "You can consider another example of\u00a0a candidate going through multiple rounds of job interviews. The final decision of candidate\u2019s ability is generally\u00a0taken based on the feedback of all the\u00a0interviewers. Although a single interviewer might not\u00a0be able to test the candidate\u00a0for each required skill\u00a0and trait. But the combined feedback of multiple interviewers\u00a0usually helps in better assessment of the candidate.", "Some of the basic concepts which you should be aware of before we go into further detail are:", "Practically speaking, there can be a countless number of ways in which you can ensemble different models. But these are some techniques that are mostly used:", "For bootstrapped sample, we choose one out of these three randomly. Say we chose Row 2.", "You see that even though Row 2 is chosen from the data to the bootstrap sample, it\u2019s still present in the data. Now, each of the three:", "Rows have the same probability of being selected again. Let\u2019s say we choose Row 1 this time.", "Again, each row in the data has the same probability to be chosen for Bootstrapped sample. Let\u2019s say we randomly choose Row 1 again.", "Thus, we can have multiple bootstrapped samples from the same data. Once we have these multiple bootstrapped samples, we can grow trees for each of these bootstrapped samples and use the majority vote or averaging concepts to get the final prediction. This is how bagging works.", "One important thing to note here is that it\u2019s done mainly to reduce the variance. Now, random forest actually uses this concept but it goes a step ahead to further reduce the variance by randomly choosing a subset of features as well for each bootstrapped sample to make the splits while training.", "It relies on creating a series of weak learners each of which might not be good for the entire dataset but is good for some part of the dataset. Thus, each model actually boosts the performance of the ensemble.", "It\u2019s really important to note that boosting is focused on reducing the bias. This makes the boosting algorithms prone to overfitting. Thus, parameter tuning becomes a crucial part of boosting algorithms to make them avoid overfitting.", "Some examples of boosting are XGBoost, GBM, ADABOOST, etc.", "Let\u2019s understand it with an example:", "Here, we have two layers of machine learning models:", "Here, we have used only two layers but it can be any number of layers and any number of models in each layer. Two of the key principles for selecting the models:", "One thing that you might have realized is that we have used the top layer model which takes as input the predictions of the bottom layer models. This top layer model can also be replaced by many other simpler formulas like:", "I believe you would have a good grasp on ensembling concepts by now. Well, enough of theory now, let\u2019s get down to implementing ensembling and see whether it can help us improve our accuracy for a real machine learning challenge. If you wish to read more about the basics of ensembling, then you can refer to this resource.", "For the purpose of implementing ensembling, I have chosen Loan Prediction problem. We have to predict whether the bank should approve the loan based on the applicant profile or not. It\u2019s a binary classification problem. You can read more about the problem here.", "I\u2019ll be using caret package in R for training various individual models. It\u2019s the goto package for modeling in R. Don\u2019t worry if you are not familiar with the caret package, you can get through this article to get the comprehensive knowledge of caret package. Let\u2019s get done with getting the data and data cleaning part.", "I have divided the data into two parts which I\u2019ll be using to simulate the training and testing operations. We now define the training controls and the predictor and outcome variables:", "Now let\u2019s get started with training a random forest and test its accuracy on the test set that we have created:", "Well, as you can see, we got 0.81 accuracy with the individual random forest model. Let\u2019s see the performance of KNN:", "It\u2019s great since we are able to get 0.86 accuracy with the individual KNN model. Let\u2019s see the performance of Logistic regression as well before we go on to create ensemble of these three.", "And the logistic regression also gives us the accuracy of 0.86.", "Now, let\u2019s try out different ways of forming an ensemble with these models as we have discussed:", "Before proceeding further, I would like you to recall about two important criteria that we previously discussed on individual model accuracy and inter-model prediction correlation which must be fulfilled. In the above ensembles, I have skipped checking for the correlation between the predictions of the three models. I have randomly chosen these three models for a demonstration of the concepts. If the predictions are highly correlated, then using these three might not give better results than individual models. But you got the point. Right?", "So far, we have used simple formulas at the top layer. Instead, we can use another machine learning model which is essentially what stacking is. We can use linear regression for making a linear formula for making the predictions in regression problem for mapping bottom layer model predictions to the outcome or logistic regression similarly in case of classification problem.", "Moreover, we don\u2019t need to restrict ourselves here, we can also use more complex models like GBM, neural nets to develop a non-linear mapping from the predictions of bottom layer models to the outcome.", "On the same example let\u2019s try applying logistic regression and GBM as top layer models. Remember, the following steps that we\u2019ll take:", "One extremely important thing to note in step 2 is that you should always make out of bag predictions for the training data, otherwise the importance of the base layer models will only be a function of how well a base layer model can recall the training data.", "Even, most of the steps have been already done previously, but I\u2019ll walk you through the steps one by one again.", "First, let\u2019s start with the GBM model as the top layer model.", "Similarly, we can create an ensemble with logistic regression as the top layer model as well.", "Great! You made your first ensemble.", "Note it\u2019s really important to choose the models for the ensemble wisely to get the best out of the ensemble. The two thumb rules that we discussed will greatly help you in that.", "By now, you might have developed an in-depth conceptual as well as practical knowledge of ensembling. I would like to encourage you to practice this on machine learning hackathons on Analytics Vidhya, which you can find here.", "You\u2019ll probably find this article on top five questions related to ensembling helpful.", "Also, if you missed out on the skilltest on ensembling, you can check your understanding of ensembling concepts here.", "Ensembling is a very popular and effective technique that is very frequently used by data scientists for beating the accuracy benchmark of even the best of individual algorithms. More often than not it\u2019s the winning recipe in hackathons. The more you\u2019ll use ensembling, the more you\u2019ll admire its beauty.", "Did you enjoy reading this article?\u00a0 Do share your views in the comment section below.
