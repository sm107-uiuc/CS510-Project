The desire to understand the answer is obvious \u2013 if we can understand this, we can enable human species to do things we might not have thought before. Alternately, we can train machines using reinforcement learning to do more \u201chuman\u201d tasks and create true artificial intelligence.", "While we don\u2019t have a complete answer to the above question yet, there are a few things which are clear. Irrespective of the skill, we first learn by interacting with the environment. Whether we are learning to drive a car or whether it an infant learning to walk, the learning is based on the interaction with\u00a0the environment. Learning from interaction is the foundational underlying concept for all theories of learning and intelligence.", "Today, we will explore Reinforcement Learning \u2013 a goal-oriented learning based on\u00a0interaction with environment.\u00a0Reinforcement Learning is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so, because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense.", "Reinforcement Learning is growing rapidly, producing wide variety of learning algorithms for different applications. Hence it is important to be familiar with the techniques of reinforcement learning. If you are not familiar\u00a0with reinforcement learning, I will suggest you to go through my previous article on introduction to reinforcement learning and the open source RL platforms.", "Once you have an understanding of underlying fundamentals, proceed with this article. By the end of this article you will have a thorough understanding of Reinforcement Learning and its practical implementation.", "P.S. For implementation, we assume that you have basic knowledge of Python. If you don\u2019t know Python, you should first go through this tutorial", "Reinforcement Learning is learning what to do and how to map situations to actions. The end result is to maximize the numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which action to take, but instead must discover which action will yield the maximum reward. Let\u2019s understand this with a simple example below.", "Consider an example of a child learning to walk.", "Here are the steps a child will take while learning \u00a0to walk:", "Sounds like a difficult task right? It actually is a bit challenging to get up and start walking, but you have become so use\u00a0to it that you are not fazed by the task. But now you can get the gist of how difficult it is for a child.", "Let\u2019s formalize the above example, the \u201cproblem statement\u201d of the example is to walk, where the child is an agent trying to manipulate the environment (which is the surface on which it walks) by taking actions (viz walking) and he/she tries to go from one state (viz each step\u00a0he/she takes) to another. The child gets a reward (let\u2019s say chocolate) when he/she accomplishes a submodule of the task (viz taking couple of steps) and will not receive any chocolate\u00a0(a.k.a negative reward) when he/she is not able to walk. This is a\u00a0simplified description of a reinforcement learning problem.", "Here\u2019s a good introductory video on Reinforcement Learning.", "Reinforcement Learning belongs to a bigger class of machine learning algorithm. Below is the description of types of machine learning methodologies.", "Let\u2019s see a comparison between RL and others:", "There is also a fourth type of machine learning methodology called semi-supervised learning, which is essentially a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It differs from reinforcement learning as similar to supervised and semi-supervised learning has direct mapping whereas reinforcement does not.", "To understand how to solve a reinforcement learning problem, let\u2019s go through a classic example of reinforcement learning problem \u2013 Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. First, we would understand the fundamental problem of exploration vs exploitation and then go on to define the framework to solve RL problems.", "Suppose you have many slot machines with random payouts. A slot machine would look something like this.", "Now you want to do is get the maximum bonus from the slot machines as fast as possible. What would you do?", "One naive approach might be to select only one slot machine and keep pulling the lever all day long. Sounds boring, but it may give you \u201csome\u201d payouts.\u00a0With this approach, you might hit the jackpot (with a probability close to 0.00000\u2026.1) but most of the time you may just be sitting in front of the slot machine losing money. Formally, this can be defined as a pure exploitation approach. Is this the optimal choice? The answer is NO.", "Let\u2019s look at another approach. We could pull a\u00a0lever of each & every slot machine and pray to God that at least one of them would hit the jackpot. This is another naive approach which would keep you pulling levers all day long, but give you sub-optimal payouts. Formally this approach is a pure exploration approach.", "Both of these approaches are not optimal, and we have to find a proper balance between them to get maximum reward. This is said to be exploration vs exploitation dilemma of reinforcement learning.", "First, we formally define the framework for reinforcement learning problem and then list down the probable approaches to solve the problem.", "The mathematical framework for defining a solution in reinforcement learning scenario is called Markov Decision Process. This can be designed as:", "We have to take an action (A) to transition from our start state to our end state (S). In return getting rewards (R) for each action we take. Our actions can lead to\u00a0a positive reward or negative reward.", "The set of actions we took define our policy (\u03c0) and the rewards we get in return defines our value (V). Our task here is to maximize our rewards by choosing the correct policy. So we have to maximize for all possible values of S for a time t.", "Let me take you through another example to make it\u00a0clear.", "This is a representation of a shortest path problem. The task is to go from place A to place F, with as low cost as possible. The numbers at each edge between two places represent the cost taken to traverse the distance. The negative cost are actually some earnings on the way. We define Value is the total cumulative reward when you do a policy.", "Now suppose you are at place A, the only visible path is your next destination and anything beyond that is not known at this stage (a.k.a observable space).", "You can take a greedy approach\u00a0and take the best possible next step, which is going from {A -> D} from a subset of {A -> (B, C, D, E)}. Similarly now you are at place D and want to go to place F, you can choose from {D -> (B, C, F)}. We see that {D -> F} has the lowest cost and hence we take that path.", "Congratulations! You have just implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm is known as epsilon greedy, which is literally a greedy approach to solving the problem. Now if you (the salesman) want to go from place A to place F again, you would always choose the same policy.", "Can you guess which category does our policy belong to\u00a0 i.e. (pure exploration vs pure exploitation)?", "Notice that the policy we took is not an optimal policy. We would have to \u201cexplore\u201d a little bit to find the optimal policy. The approach which we took here is policy based learning, and our task is to find the optimal policy among all the possible policies. There are different ways to solve this problem, I\u2019ll briefly list down the major categories", "I would try to cover in-depth reinforcement learning algorithms in future articles.", "We will be using Deep Q-learning algorithm. Q-learning is a policy based learning algorithm with the function approximator as a neural network. This algorithm was used by Google to beat humans at Atari games!", "Let\u2019s see a pseudocode of\u00a0 Q-learning:", "A simple description of Q-learning can be summarized as follows:", "We will first see what Cartpole problem is then go on to coding up a solution", "When I was a kid, I remember that I would pick a stick and try to balance it on one hand.

We set our policy as Epsilon Greedy and\u00a0we also set our memory as Sequential Memory because we want to store the result of actions we performed and the rewards we get for each action.", "Now we test our reinforcement learning model", "This will be the output of our model:", "And Voila! You have just built a reinforcement learning bot!", "Now that you have seen a basic implementation of Re-inforcement learning, let us start moving towards a few more problems, increasing the complexity little bit every time.", "For those, who don\u2019t know the game \u2013 it was invented in 1883 and\u00a0consists of 3 rods along with\u00a0a number of sequentially-sized disks (3 in the figure above) starting at\u00a0the leftmost rod. The objective is to move all the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod\u00a0with the least number of moves. (You can read more on\u00a0wikipedia)", "If we have to map this problem, let us start with states:", "Here are our 27 possible states:", "Where (12)3* represents disks 1 and 2 in leftmost rod (top to bottom) 3 in middle rod and * denotes an empty rightmost rod", "Since we want to solve the problem in least number of steps, we can attach a reward of -1 to each step.", "Now, without going in any technical details, we can map possible transitions between above states. For example (123)** -> (23)1* with reward -1. It can also go to (23)*1", "If you can now see a parallel, each of these 27 states mentioned above can represent a graph similar to that of shortest path algorithm above and we can find the most optimal solutions by experimenting various states and paths.", "While I can solve this for you as well, I would want you to do this by yourself. Follow the same line of thought I used above and you should be good.", "Start by defining the Starting state and the end state. Next, define all possible states and their transitions along with reward and policy. Finally, you should be able to create a solution for solving a rubix cube using the same approach.", "As you would realize that the complexity of this Rubix Cube is many folds higher than the Towers of Hanoi. You can also understand how the possible number of options have increased in number. Now, think of number of states and options in a game of Chess and then in Go! Google DeepMind recently created a deep reinforcement learning algorithm which defeated Lee Sedol!", "With the recent success in Deep Learning, now the focus is slowly shifting to applying deep learning to solve reinforcement learning problems. The news recently has been flooded with the defeat of Lee Sedol by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm developed by Google DeepMind. Similar breakthroughs are being seen in video games, where the algorithms developed are achieving human-level accuracy and beyond. Research is still at par, with both industrial and academic masterminds working together to accomplish the goal of building better self-learning robots", "Some major domains where RL has been applied are as follows:", "There are so many things unexplored and with the current craze of deep learning applied to reinforcement learning, there certainly are breakthroughs incoming!", "Here is one of the recent news:", "Excited to share an update on #AlphaGo! pic.twitter.com/IT5HGBmYDr", "I hope now you have in-depth understanding of how reinforcement learning works.
