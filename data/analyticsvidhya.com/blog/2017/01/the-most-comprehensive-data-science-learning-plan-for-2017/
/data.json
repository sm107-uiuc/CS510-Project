I had no clue what was in store for me. I had been following the blog for some time and liked the community, but did not know what to expect as an intern.", "The initial few days were good \u2013 all the interns were smart, motivated and fun to be around. We played cricket in office, did internal hackathons over weekends and learnt a lot of data science. But, if there was one defining moment for me in the internship \u2013 it was when I realized the impact Analytics Vidhya was having in data science community.", "I saw thousands of people following Analytics Vidhya religiously. I saw people looking up for guidance in our meetups and hackathons. I saw people transitioning their careers because of the resources we provide them. That is when this good internship transformed into a mind blowing experience.", "That is the day I decided that this is my calling. It just felt that this is what I would want to do daily.", "Among various resources on Analytics Vidhya, learning paths are special. The amount of effort and thinking they need is tremendous. The number of drafts they undergo is mind-boggling. But, the kind of impact they create for our audience is HUGE. That is why I decided that I will create a learning plan for 2017 for all our followers.", "We created a similar plan for 2016 and we saw transitions happening by people following this learning plan. This time we have created a much granular and a more detailed learning plan. The sole aim behind creating this comprehensive plan is to create a much bigger impact for our followers this year.", "This learning path would be extremely useful for any one who wants to learn machine learning, deep learning or data science in this year. If you plan to wait for a year, we will publish something similar in 2018 as well \ud83d\ude42", "But, for the people looking for action this year, this framework and plan of action should be extremely useful. Whether you are a complete fresher or a transitioner or you are looking to up-skill yourself, this plan should give you the necessary direction.", "We published a similar plan in\u00a02016 and we saw followers making\u00a0transition by simply following the plan. This year\u2019s plan is more nuanced than last year\u2019s one \u2013 so if you plan to pick up / improve data science skills \u2013 this plan will guide you through the journey.", "In creating this plan, we have removed the confusion from the process of learning. The biggest challenge which people face while learning is not dearth of learning material \u2013 but too much of it. You are not sure where to start learning, what to practice, how much time to spend on a concept, where to get the useful resources etc. For most of the beginners, this becomes overwhelming and they simply drop out before even learning a single skill.", "This plan takes this confusion out. This path contains both theoretical resources as well practical examples. We have also provided you with resources / tests to apply\u00a0your learning and benchmark yourself. As part of this plan, you will apply the concepts you learn on real-world problems and gain hands-on experience.", "The first thing you need to do is identify which kind of learner are you. Have a look at the definitions / descriptions below and identify which category you belong to.", "We have created these guides with the following target in mind:", "At this stage, it is important to understand why you want to become a data scientist? What are your strengths and weaknesses?\u00a0Do you know what it takes to be a Data Scientist? You must answers these questions before jumping on the boat of Data Science journey.", "Watch this excellent video where Tetiana Ivanova describes how she became a Data Scientist without going through a Masters or doctorate program in data science and with help of Meetups.", "Here\u00a0are some additional\u00a0resources you can use to answer these questions:", "Go ahead and think through these\u00a0aspects of choosing a career in data science. This decision is going to decide the next 11 months of your life.", "It is very important for a Data Scientist to have a GitHub profile to host all the codes of the project he/she has undertaken. Potential employers not only see what you have done, how you have coded and how frequently / how long you have been practicing data science.", "Also, codes on GitHub open up avenues for open source projects which can highly boost your learning. If you don\u2019t know how to use Git,\u00a0you can learn from\u00a0Git and GitHub\u00a0on Udacity. This is one of the best and easy to learn course to manage the repositories through terminal.", "Time and again, I have stressed on the fact that practice beats theory. Moreover coding in hackathons brings you closer to developing data products in real life for solving real world problems. Below are most popular platforms to participate in Data Science/ Machine Learning Competitions.", "Discussions are a great way to learn in a peer-to-peer setup from finding an answer to a question you stuck to providing answers to someone else\u2019s questions. Below are some of the discussion rich platforms which you should keep a tab on to clear your doubts.", "Topics to be covered: Jobs / Internships", "If you are here after diligently following the above steps, then you can be sure that you are ready for a Job / Internship position at any Data Science / Analytics or Machine Learning firms. But it becomes quite difficult to identify the right jobs. So, for the purpose of saving the trouble, I have created a list of portals which lists down Data Science/ Machine Learning jobs and Internships.", "In order to prepare for these interviews, you should go through this Damn Good Hiring Guide", "Let me start by giving you the bad news \u2013 it is not going to be easy to transition in data science. Also, the more your work experience, the more difficult your transition would typically be. You would need a strong resolve \u2013 there will be times when you might question, whether this is the right domain for you.", "The good news is that once you get your first break in the industry, there is no looking back. Also, because of the salary differential from other industry, you may not need to compromise on your earnings during transition.", "To achieve your goal all you have to do is follow this learning path diligently. We have covered all the skills, techniques you need to gain to take your first steps in data science.", "Simply put, if you are looking for a transition under a year, you will need to learn everything we\u00a0laid out for the beginner above. Additionally, you will need to carve out additional time to showcase your skills. You will need to overcome the doubts of your potential employers through your projects and work.", "I am sure you are beginning to understand why transition is not an easy thing.", "The structure of the path is similar, but you will need to accelerate your learning in the first half of the plan. Start by\u00a0going through this article\u00a0and go through a few success stories to understand what a transition would entail. Once you are set for the journey, follow the plan by sticking to these timelines.\n", "If you can build predictive models, but don\u2019t necessary know deep learning and some recent development in the domain, this learning path can help you out. Depending on your skills and learning plan for the year, you can pick and choose the areas you want to learn.", "Structure of intermediate path for 2017:", "The first step in creating your learning plan is to benchmark yourself on various\u00a0skills \u2013 both technical and structured thinking. You can go through the skill tests on Analytics Vidhya to judge whether you need to review the old material. If you do well, go ahead with acquiring new skills. Else, go back to practice for some more time.", "If you feel the need to go through the old material once again, refer to beginner\u2019s path which contains various useful\u00a0resources.", "There are a few specific machine learning algorithms, which come in handy while solving specific problems. For example, try solving online click prediction on large data sets with out applying online learning algorithms and you would know what I am talking about. Here are a few advanced ML algorithms you should learn this month:", "\nExercise: Practice on one of the old Kaggle competitions or open click through rate data sets as provided by Criteo.", "Ideally you should pick up D3.js for sure and either one of QlikView and Tableau. While D3.js provides the most flexibility, QlikView and Tableau are both handy for creating dashboards or less complex story creation and narration.", "The reason d3.js is not so much popular among Data Scientist is because it requires an entire different skill test like HTML, CSS, Javascript which is not typical of a Data Scientist.", "But knowing D3.js can take your story telling capabilities to a different level. You can create non-static Interactive graphs embedded right in a browser for a much richer experience. Below are the list of resources to master d3.js", "Topics to be covered: Reinforcement Learning (Theory)", "Now that you\u00a0know machine learning well, you might want to apply it to web products. What you need to learn is a working knowledge about web frameworks. Web frameworks allow you to quickly build and prototype web based products, with out getting into\u00a0the complications of coding.", "Given that you would already have working knowledge of Python, you can choose any of the Python based web frameworks. I would recommend Flask for its simplicity. Flask is a simple and light web framework, which should serve your needs well. If you are looking to build a complex web product, you might want to consider Django as well.", "Additionally, you should do a side project to merry your machine learning skills and web development skills. You can build a simple web application where users can upload pictures and find which make and model the car is. Or may be tells people about their age.\n", "Now that you know how to build web applications, you should also get your hands dirty on cloud computing. A few popular platforms are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure.", "Each of these platform provide extensive documentation for their offering. If you have to pick only one \u2013 AWS is the way to go because of its popularity, wide spread use and comprehensive offerings.", "I hope you found this learning path\u00a0helpful. I have made it as specific and comprehensive as possible. If you think I have missed out on any specific areas or resources, do let me know.", "If you want to progress in your data science journey all you have to do is choose your category and follow the learning diligently.", "If you have any questions, doubts or suggestions drop in your comment below and I will be happy to answer them.", "If you want to make your own learning path share it with me how are you planning to follow your journey of becoming a data scientist.", "I am a perpetual, quick learner and keen to explore the realm of Data analytics and science. I am deeply excited about the times we live in and the rate at which data is being generated and being transformed as an asset.
