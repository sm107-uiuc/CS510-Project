SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a query language used to access data from relational databases and is widely used in data science. It is especially powerful for querying datasets for data analysis. SQL can be used with various relational database systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc., for executing complex queries. Positions like data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist require you to have good expertise in SQL, python programming language, and machine learning. In this article, we will be looking at questions that can test a data science professional on SQL for data analytics or data engineering.", "This test focuses on practical aspects and challenges people encounter while using SQL. In this article, we provide answers to these test questions. If you took the test, check out all the SQL questions and identify which areas need improvement. If you did not take the test, here is your opportunity to look at the questions and check your skill level independently.", "We conducted a skill test to test our community on SQL and it gave 2017 a rocking start. A total of 1,666 participants registered for the skill test. Below is the\u00a0distribution of scores; this will help you evaluate your performance:", "You can assess your performance here. More than 700 people participated in the skill test\u00a0and the highest score was 41.\u00a0Here are a few statistics about the distribution.", "This is an interesting distribution. I think we are seeing 3 different profiles of people here:", "To learn SQL or to improve your SQL skills, you can have a look at these resources.", "A. select, group by, where, having", "B. select, where, group by, having", "C. select, where, having, group by", "D. select, having, where, group by", "Explanation: Where clause always comes before group by clause and having clause always comes after group by. The select statement always comes first.", "Query: SELECT cid FROM ENROLLED WHERE grade = 'C'", "A. Extract the course ids(cid) where the student received the grade C in the course", "B. Extract the unique course ids(cid) where the student received the grade C in the course", "Explanation: The query will extract the course ids where students receive the grade \u201cC\u201d in the course.", "Query: SELECT DISTINCT cid FROM ENROLLED WHERE grade = 'C'", "A. Extract the course ids where the student receive the grade C in the course", "B. Extract the Distinct course ids where the student receive the grade of C in the course", "Explanation: By using the DISTINCT keyword, you can extract the distinct course ids where students received a grade of C in the course.", "Query: SELECT name, cid FROM student, enrolled WHERE student.sid = enrolled.sid AND enrolled.grade = 'C'", "A. Returns the name of all students and their corresponding course ids", "B. Returns the name of students and their corresponding course id where they have received grade C", "Explanation: In the above query, we perform an inner join on the ENROLLED and STUDENT tables. Then, it will evaluate the WHERE condition, and then it will return the name of the students and the corresponding course id where they received the grade of C.", "A. Returns the name and grade of the students who took the course \u201915-415\u2032 and got a grade \u2019A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in that course", "B.

So Option C is the\u00a0right answer.", "Explanation: All are related to transaction control in SQL.", "A. It can take a value more than once", "B. It can take null values", "C. It can\u2019t take null values", "Explanation: In a relational schema, there exists only one primary key, and it can\u2019t take null values. So option C is the correct answer.", "A. Primary key cannot be a date variable, whereas a unique key can be", "B. You can have only one primary key, whereas you can have multiple unique keys", "C. Primary key can take null values, but the unique key cannot be null values", "Explanation: You can create a date variable as a primary key in a table. In a relational schema, you can have only one primary key and there may be multiple unique keys present in the table. A unique key can take null values.", "A. It is usually slower than the DELETE command", "B. It is usually faster than the DELETE command", "C. There is no comparison between DELETE & TRUNCATE", "D. Truncate command can be rolled back", "Explanation: TRUNCATE is faster than delete bcoz truncate is a DDL command. So it does not produce any rollback information, and the storage space is released while the delete command is a DML command. Also, it produces rollback information, and space is not deallocated using the delete command.", "A. We need to assign a datatype to each column", "B. We have flexibility in SQL. We can assign a data type to a column even after creating a table", "C. It is mandatory to insert at least a single row while creating a table", "Explanation: Each column must possess behavioral attributes like data types and precision to build the structure of the table.", "Explanation: In DBMS records are also known as tuples and rows. And columns are known as attributes and fields.", "Explanation: In SQL, if you want to compare a null value\u00a0you need to use IS statement.", "Explanation: HAVING is performed after GROUP BY. If you have to apply some conditions to get results. you need to use WHERE before group by.

Based on the above table, we cannot tell which column is \u2018Primary Key\u2019 and which is \u2018Foreign Key\u2019", "Explanation: Column A is taking unique values, and column A doesn\u2019t have null values. So it can be considered the Primary key of this table. Whereas B is the example of a foreign key because all values present in this column are already present in column A.", "Suppose you are using \u2018ON DELETE CASCADE\u2019.Note: We have defined \u2018Foreign Key\u2019 and \u2018Primary Key\u2019 in a single table", "Explanation: When (2,4) is deleted. Since C is a foreign key referring to A with delete on cascade, all entries with value 2 in C must be deleted. So (5, 2) and (7, 2) are deleted. As a result of this, 5 and 7 are deleted from A, which causes (9, 5) to be deleted.", "You are given a table/relation, \u201cEMPLOYEE,\u201d which has two columns (\u2018Name\u2019 and \u2018Salary\u2019).

Query 2 will give the first row as output (only record containing null value)", "C. Query 1 and Query 2 both will give the same result", "Explanation: If we compare(<>, =) Salary, it will give 0 records. Below are the following reasons:", "Tables A and B have three columns (namely: \u2018id\u2019, \u2018age\u2019, and \u2018name\u2019). These tables have no \u2018null\u2019 values, and there are 100 records in each table.Here are two queries based on these two tables, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019:Query1: SELECT A.id FROM A WHERE A.age > ALL (SELECT B.age FROM B WHERE B.name = 'Ankit')Query2: SELECT A.id FROM A WHERE A.age > ANY (SELECT B.age FROM B WHERE B.name = 'Ankit')", "A.

The number of tuples in the output of Query 1 will be less than or equal to the output of Query 2", "Explanation: ANY and ALL operate on subqueries that return multiple values. ANY returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition. But in the case of ALL, it will return the records if all conditions are true. So option C is correct.", "Explanation: If a relation satisfies higher normal forms, it automatically satisfies lower normal forms also. For example, if a relation is satisfying kNF it will automatically satisfy gNF where g<=k.", "{AB->C, BC->AD, D->E, CF->B}Which of the following will be the output of DA+?Note: For any X, X+ is the closure of X.", "Suppose you have a table \u201cLoan_Records\u201d.SELECT Count(*)\u00a0 FROM\u00a0 ( (SELECT Borrower, Bank_Manager FROM\u00a0\u00a0 Loan_Records) AS S NATURAL JOIN (SELECT Bank_Manager, Loan_Amount FROM\u00a0\u00a0 Loan_Records) AS T );", "Explanation: Temporary table S is given below", "Temporary table T is given below", "If you apply natural join on both tables (S and T) and evaluate the condition on \u2018Bank_Manager\u2019. You will get the following intermediate table after applying natural join", "\u201cSunderjan\u201d appears two times in the Bank_Manager column, so there will be four entries with Bank_Manager as \u201cSunderjan\u201d. So count(*) will give the 5 output in the outer query.", "A. Yes, both are equivalent in all the cases", "B. No, both are not equivalent", "Explanation: In relational algebra \u2018PROJECT\u2019 operation gives the unique record, but in the case of the \u2018SELECT\u2019 operation in SQL, you need to use a distinct keyword for get unique records.", "Questions 32-36 are based on the above table.", "Query 1: Select name from AV1 where name like '%a%'", "Query: SELECT Name from AV1 where Name LIKE '%______%';Note: The above operation contains 6 underscores (\u2018_\u2019) used with the LIKE operator.", "A.

It will return names where the number of characters in names is less than or equal to 6", "D. It will give an error", "Explanation: The query will search for records in column \u2018Name\u2019 where the number of characters in names is greater than or equal to 6.", "Explanation: This query will give the error because \u2018WHERE\u2019 is always evaluated before \u2018GROUP BY\u2019 and \u2018Having\u2019 is always evaluated after \u2018GROUP BY\u2019", "Query 1: SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM AV1 WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) from AV1);Query 2: WITH S AS (SELECT Salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum FROM AV1) SELECT Salary FROM S WHERE RowNum = 2;", "Explanation: Both queries will generate the second-highest salary in AV1, which is 1200.
