Yes, to install MySQL! Quite an anti-climatic start, right? At times, you stumble upon jewels while going through StackOverflow and Docker was one of them. What started with a one-off use case, ended up becoming a useful tool in my daily workflow.", "I got a taste of docker when I tried to install TensorFlow in my system. Just to give you the context, TensorFlow is a deep learning library which requires a series of steps that you ought to do for system setup. Especially it is extremely complex to install Nvidia Graphics drivers. I literally had to reinstall my Operating system countless number of times. That loop stopped only when I shifted to docker, thankfully!", "Docker provides you with an easy way to share your working environments including libraries and drivers. This enables us to create reproducible data science workflows.", "This article aims to provide the perfect starting point to nudge you to use Docker for your Data Science workflows! I will cover both the useful aspects of Docker \u2013 namely, setting up your system without installing the tools and creating your own data science environment.", "Docker is a software technology providing containers, promoted by the company Docker, Inc. Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows and Linux.", "The underlying concept that Docker promotes is usage of containers, which are essentially \u201cboxes\u201d of self-contained softwares. Containers have been in existence before Docker & quite successful, but 2015 saw a huge adoption by the software community in terms of containerization to solve the day-to-day issues.", "When you walk into a cubicle of Data Science folks, they are either doing data processing or struggling to setup something on their work-stations/laptops. Okay, that might be an exaggeration but you get the sense of helplessness. To give a small example, for someone to setup a\u00a0Caffe\u00a0environment there are more than\u00a030 unique ways. And trust me, you\u2019ll end up creating a new blogpost just for showing all the steps!", "You get the idea.\u00a0Anaconda distribution\u00a0has made virtual environments and replicating environments using a standardized method a reality\u2026yet things do get muddled and sometimes we miss the bullet points in the\u00a0README file, carefully created to replicate those.", "To solve the above problem,\u00a0bash scripts\u00a0and\u00a0makefiles\u00a0are added which adds to more confusion. It becomes as simple as\u00a0untangling earphones, phew!", "Docker\u2019s learning curve\u00a0might be a bit steep, but it helps to solve:", "The\u00a0Caffe\u00a0example we discussed is one of the pain points that everyone experiences in their Data Science journey. Not only\u00a0Docker\u00a0helps to set a consistent platform via which these tools can be shared, the time wasted in searching for\u00a0operating system\u00a0specific installers/libraries is eliminated.", "Along with sharing the tools (docker images as installers), we can share\u00a0Jupyter notebooks\u00a0or\u00a0scripts\u00a0along with their results baked inside a\u00a0Docker image. All the other person/colleague needs to do is run the\u00a0Docker image\u00a0to find out what\u2019s there!", "In\u00a0my last article, we looked at how wrapping ML model in an API helps to make it available to your consumers.

Let\u2019s understand the\u00a0Docker terminologies\u00a0first.", "For starters,\u00a0containers\u00a0can be thought of as mini-VMs that are light-weight, disposable. Technically though, they are just processes (threads if you might say) that are created when you fire Docker commands in your terminal via their Command Line Interface (CLI).", "Docker also provides:\u00a0images\u00a0that are essentially snapshots of the\u00a0containers\u00a0whose running state is saved using Docker CLI or generated using\u00a0Dockerfile.", "A\u00a0Dockerfile\u00a0can be considered as an automated setup file. This small file helps to create/modify Docker images. All the talk makes no sense, until there\u2019s some proof. Let\u2019s dive in and fire up your terminals.", "Think of the process of creating a\u00a0Docker image\u00a0as creating a\u00a0layered cake.\u00a0Dockerfile\u00a0being your\u00a0recipe,\u00a0Docker image\u00a0created out of various layers.", "In the next few sections, we\u2019ll try to get a feel of\u00a0Docker\u00a0and work with its command line commands.

Those that will help more, next section is all about that:\u00a0Data Science tools without installation, our first use case.", "You have a clean laptop and you need to install\u00a0TensorFlow\u00a0in your system, but you are lazy (yes we all are sometimes). You want to procrastinate and not install things on your laptop, but you have\u00a0Docker\u00a0installed already as a standard company practice. Hmm, interesting times, you ponder!", "You go to\u00a0Dockerhub\u00a0and search for the official\u00a0Docker\u00a0image for\u00a0TensorFlow. All you need to run on your terminal is:\u00a0docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow", "As discussed above (in\u00a0Docker Terminology\u00a0section), the\u00a0tensorflow\u00a0docker image is also a layered object that forms images. Once all the intermediate layers are downloaded, run:\u00a0docker images\u00a0to check whether our\u00a0docker pull\u00a0was successful.", "Now the above\u00a0docker run\u00a0command packs in a few more command line argurments. A few which you need to know better are as follows:", "Now since a docker container is created, you can visit:\u00a0http://localhost:8889\u00a0where you can try out\u00a0tensorflow.", "Wasn\u2019t that easy? Now as a exercise, replace\u00a0-it\u00a0in the\u00a0docker run\u00a0command by\u00a0-d.

Personally, I\u2019d whine about the above TensorFlow image. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s there in it (unless I look at the source code i.e. the\u00a0Dockerfile\u00a0aka\u00a0recipe). Tensorflow isn\u2019t enough on it\u2019s own, suppose you want to use\u00a0OpenCV\u00a0too and maybe\u00a0scikit-learn\u00a0&\u00a0matplotlib.", "Let\u2019s see how to create your own custom\u00a0TensorFlow\u00a0image!", "Docker provides a good support to build up from a prototype level scale to production levels. Purely from a deployments perspective:\u00a0docker-machine,\u00a0docker-compose\u00a0&\u00a0docker-swarm\u00a0are components that help achieve that.", "Starting off with a new habit is a difficult task. But once the learning curve smoothens out, things start to work out and new ideas open up with the usage.
