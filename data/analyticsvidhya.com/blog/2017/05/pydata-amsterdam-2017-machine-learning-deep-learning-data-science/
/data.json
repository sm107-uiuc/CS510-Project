Keep in mind that this video is a bit demanding, and you should have prior knowledge of basics of data science.", "I was living in another state for almost 6 years and didn\u2019t know the native language of the place. I always used to wonder if they hear my words similar to what I think of theirs.\u00a0John Paten has answered my question here. He tries to demonstrate how our language looks to people who actually don\u2019t speak it. He makes simple Markov Models for simulating any language in python. He shows various visualisations to understand the similarity and differences between various languages. There are very simple yet interesting insights about different languages regarding the most commonly used letters or whether a language uses long words or shorter ones to express the feelings. After this video you shall be able to understand the working of Markov models and would be able to understand and analyse languages using your models.", "Just watching these videos wouldn\u2019t make you a better analyst.
