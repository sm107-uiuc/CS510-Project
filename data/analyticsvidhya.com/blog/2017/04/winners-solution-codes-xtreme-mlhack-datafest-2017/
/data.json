We did that by creating our most unique hackathon \u2013 Xtreme ML Hack as part of DataFest 2017. We were looking for an exciting real life problem and would want to thanks\u00a0our sponsor \u2013\u00a0Aigues de Barcelona\u00a0for providing us with an opportunity to host this wonderful competition.", "Xtreme ML Hack\u00a0started\u00a0on 20 April 2017 and went on for 4 days. We saw more than\u00a02400 participants from across the globe. There were multiple things which were unique for this competition. This was the first time we were working for a Spainish company. This was also an unique hackathon because the participants were allowed to use any available open data. Also, this was the fist time we were working with an utility company.", "I think this was probably the most challenging hackathon we have released till now \u2013 this is as close as you can get to a real life project. Like always, the winners of the competition have generously shared their detailed approach and the codes they used in the competition.", "If you missed out the fun, make sure you participate in the upcoming MiniHack \u2013 The QuickSolver.", "The problem statement revolved around\u00a0public-private company Aig\u00fces de Barcelona. It manages the integral cycle of water, from the uptake to the drinking process, transport and distribution, besides the sanitation and the purification of waste water for its return to the natural environment or its re-use. It offers service to about 3 million people in the municipalities of the metropolitan area of Barcelona. It also manages a customer service to ensure excellence in their services.", "Customer Service is one of the top priorities of the company. They want to redesign the customer service using machine learning.", "To respond to their customers efficiently they want to predict the volume and typologies of contacts to the call center. They also want to forecast the number of contacts on daily basis. The task was to forecast the number of contacts & resolutions the company should open on daily basis.", "The winners used different approaches and rose up on the leaderboard. Below are the top 3 winners on the leaderboard:", "Rank 1: Rohan Rao & Mark Landry", "Here are the final rankings of all the participants at the\u00a0leaderboard.", "All the Top 3 winners have shared their detailed approach & code from the competition. I am sure you are eager to know their secrets, go ahead.", "Here\u2019s what Aanish\u00a0shared with us.", "Aanish says \u201cI started out by building an understanding of how autonomous communities, provinces, municipalities and districts are related to each other in Spain. Then I looked at the data dictionary and what all was provided and what was expected, followed by exploratory data analysis.\u201d", "I also figured out that there was a close correlation between new contracts, ended contracts and number of contacts. I had 2 choices.", "I used top down approach as the there was only 1 level involved. I predicted the contacts at day level using Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components (tbats) using weekly, quarterly and yearly seasonality. To accommodate the trends at type level, I found the average contribution by type for 2016 and for all years (some types had different trends in recent years). Using separate contribution percentages by types and for weekdays and weekends, I split the overall forecast into detailed forecast.", "Resolutions had 2 levels (category and subject), hence top down approach was not suitable. Also, breaking the high-level forecast into 2 levels would be quite error prone so I selected hierarchical time series modeling for this. I used tbats() for each subject to account for multiple seasonality on the data. Most of the effort was in preparing data in the format accepted by hierarchical time series modeling function, hts(). I used only last 3 years of data (optimized after first submission) as that was having lesser missing values and avoided the spiked 2013 data. Combining of low level forecast with top level was done using LU decomposition algorithm.", "Prediction from this resulted in some negative values, especially for the weekend. I replaced them with respective mean from 2016 weekend data.", "On submission, I had a score of 104.6 but decided not to change the model too much as it was very generic.", "Here\u2019s what Sonny shared with us.", "He says \u201cThis was one of the best competitions till now on Analytics Vidhya. Moreover, the introduction of submission limits made it even more interesting. This competition was definitely not a good place to start from if you had just started learning ML. My first thought on looking at the problem made me think that it had to be solved as a time-series problem which later seemed to be wrong.\u201d", "It was a no-brainer to find that the only data in the Test Set were \u201cfuture\u201d dates. Did that look odd? Come to reality! The variable to predict was # of contacts/resolutions. After some initial analysis, I decided that this has to be treated as two different problems.", "For the modeling purpose, I created day wise-medium wise-department wise aggregated # of contacts and resolutions from 2010 onwards (since we had data on contacts/resolutions only after 2010). For cross-validation, I decided to use the last four months. So my first model was built on few \u201cDate\u201d features and it scored 101.X which was a very good score on Day1.", "The next thing that struck me was that holidays should have an impact on these contacts and resolutions. Hence I created a list of holidays in Spain since 2010. Just adding holidays to the above list improved the score to 93.X. I was feeling good but it didn\u2019t last longer since I saw Mark jumping to 78.X.", "Later, I decided to add \u201clag\u201d features of # of contacts/resolutions from the past. After a few iterations, I decided to keep lag features of 75, 90 and 120 days. With this, the score improved to 64.X (ahead of Mark J). Rohan was around 114.X so I knew that he was either asleep or solving Soduku. This was on Saturday morning and I was unable to find any additional features that could help me move ahead. So I decided to take a break.\u00a0 By evening, I noticed that Rohan had woken up and was also at around 78.X (That\u2019s when I guess Mark and Rohan decided to team up).", "On Sunday, I added a feature on number of days (percentile) elapsed since last holiday and that added few points. My final 10-bags XGboost ensemble scored 61.47081 on the public leaderboard which I selected for \u201cfinal submission\u201d. I had around 8 submissions left which I wish I could donate to few folks who were not aware that they could not mark their final submissions if they didn\u2019t upload code L.", "It might sound that the journey of adding features and improving scores was a very smooth line something like this.", "But it was not. I tried many things which didn\u2019t work.", "Below are few approaches that I tried but didn\u2019t seem to add value:", "Overall, this was a different problem and really enjoyed solving it. Thanks to Mark and Rohan for a tough fight.", "Here\u2019s what Mark & Rohan shared with us.", "I kept the feature space fairly small.", "Calendar Features:\nday of the week, week of the year, the day of the year & year.", "average Contacts per day of week and Contact type", "average Resolution per day of week, category, and subject", "Other modeling: used all the data", "separate models for Contacts and Resolution", "validation: started with Leave-One-Year-Out, finished measuring January \u2013 March 2016 (prior year from test predictions)", "I started modeling with simple averages, as shown above, where the entire data set was used, and those results were applied to the entire dataset. But soon I moved to a more sound version of the calculation where the impact of each record is removed from the calculation so that it is not leaked. And toward the end, I used an entire validation set to where no records of that set were used in the average calculations (similar to the actual prediction environment).", "I started exploring the data to get a sense of basic movement of values across the years. I decided to go with granularity and build a model for each type / category in Contacts and Resolution. I ultimately ended up plotting over 2000 graphs and summaries, which really helped identify various patterns.", "After trying a bunch of features and models, I found historic averages out-performing all ML-based models. So, I decided to focus and tune the average values so as to capture seasonality and trend in the right way. In some ways, this was like a manually-customized time series model.", "1. There were two highly seasonal components. Weekly and yearly. The following lag features: same week year and weekday in the previous year, previous/next week year and same weekday in the previous year, helped capture seasonality.", "Besides these core features, other things that worked were:", "2. Using estimates for holiday dates. Most holidays had 0 volume and highly noisy values. Aligning these correctly across the years helped.", "3. My non-ML historic averages approach blended extremely well with Mark\u2019s ML-model which didn\u2019t use lag-features. Our simple ensemble gave a lift of almost 10 on RMSE.", "4. Throw away all data prior to 2015, so as to focus only on the most recent trends.", "It was great fun interacting with these winners and to know their approach during the\u00a0competition. Hopefully, you will be able to evaluate where you missed out.", "I am a Business Analytics and Intelligence professional with deep experience in the Indian Insurance industry.
