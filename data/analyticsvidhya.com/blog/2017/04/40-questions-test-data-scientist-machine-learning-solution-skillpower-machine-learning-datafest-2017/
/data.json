If you are a data scientist, you need to be good at python, SQL, and machine learning \u2013 no two ways about it. As part of DataFest 2017, we organized various skill tests so that data scientists could assess themselves on these critical skills. These tests included Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Time Series problems, and Probability.
