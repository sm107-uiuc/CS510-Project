In one of my last article, I discussed various tools and components that are used in the implementation of NLP. Most of the components discussed in the article were described using venerated library \u2013 NLTK  (Natural Language Toolkit).", "In this article, I will share my notes on one of the powerful and advanced libraries used to implement nlp \u2013 spaCy.", "Spacy is written in cython language, (C extension of Python designed to give C like performance to the python program). Hence is a quite fast library. spaCy provides a concise API to access its methods and properties governed by trained machine (and deep) learning models.", "Spacy, its data, and its models can be easily installed using python package index and setup tools.

Let\u2019s create a document by loading a text data in our pipeline. I am using reviews of a hotel obtained from tripadvisor\u2019s website. The data file can be downloaded here.", "The document is now part of spacy.english model\u2019s class and is associated with a number of properties. The properties of a document (or tokens) can listed by using following command:", "This outputs a wide range of document properties such as \u2013 tokens, token\u2019s reference index, part of speech tags, entities, vectors, sentiment, vocabulary etc. Let\u2019s explore some of these properties.", "Every spaCy document is tokenized into sentences and further into tokens which can be accessed by iterating the document:", "Part-of-speech tags are the properties of the word that are defined by the usage of the word in the grammatically correct sentence. These tags can be used as the text features in information filtering, statistical models, and rule based parsing.", "Lets check all the pos tags of our document", "Let\u2019s explore some top unigrams of the document. I have created a basic preprocessing and text cleaning function.", "Spacy consists of a fast entity recognition model which is capable of identifying entitiy phrases from the document.

It uses GloVe  vectors to generate vectors. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.", "Let\u2019s create some word vectors and perform some interesting operations.", "Integrating spacy in machine learning model is pretty easy and straightforward. Let\u2019s build a custom text classifier using sklearn. We will create a sklearn pipeline with following components: cleaner, tokenizer, vectorizer, classifier. For tokenizer and vectorizer we will built our own custom modules using spacy.", "Let\u2019s now create a custom tokenizer function using spacy parser and some basic cleaning. One thing to note here is that, the text features can be replaced with word vectors (especially beneficial in deep learning models)", "We are now ready to create the pipeline, load the data (sample here), and run the classifier model.", "Spacy is very powerful and industrial strength package for almost all natural language processing tasks.
