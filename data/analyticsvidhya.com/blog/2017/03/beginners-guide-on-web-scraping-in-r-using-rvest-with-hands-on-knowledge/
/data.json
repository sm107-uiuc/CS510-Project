I strongly believe web scraping is a must have skill for any data scientist. In today\u2019s world, all the data that you need is already available on the\u00a0internet \u2013 the only thing limiting you from using it is the ability to access it. With the help of this article, you will be able to overcome that barrier as well.", "Most of the data available over the web\u00a0is not readily available.
