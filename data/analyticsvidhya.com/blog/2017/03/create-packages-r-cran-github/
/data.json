Open source is a decentralised development model which is based on community participation. The community members contribute to\u00a0the development of the programming language and these contributions are publicly available to be accessed by anyone.", "Community participation is the prime reason for continuous development and innovation in these open source languages like R, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. For data science, R is one of the most popular language. The main reason for its popularity is continuous contribution and support from R practitioners in the data science community. These packages form the backbone of R programming language.", "While a lot of tutorials are being shared across on solving problems using R, the open source development gets lesser attention. \u00a0For me, creating a package and giving it back to the community meant a huge thing. It was my way to starting to give back and I know this is just the start.", "In order to help expand the community further, I decided to write an article about the process of package creation and how to contribute a package to open source R community. Also,\u00a0we are going to create a package and contribute it to the open source community.", "A package in R is simply a reusable R function(s) with standard and self-explanatory documentation on how to use it. Sometimes, packages come with sample data as well.", "There are 10,000+ packages on CRAN until today and majority of these packages have dependency\u00a0on some other R package(s). This signifies that most of the packages are built over the functionality of some other package(s).", "For example, a package I authored named ensembleR has main dependency on caret package along with some other packages: e1071, ipred, knitr, rmarkdown which are used for running the examples and creating vignettes.", "You can realise the importance of packages in R by this handy infographic with the most commonly used libraries in R:", "Sometime back in one of the competition on Analytics Vidhya, I was trying to ensemble varioud models. I realized that there is no easy to use open source package for ensembling in R.", "That\u2019s when I decided to take this opportunity to create a simple package that will enable people to perform ensembling (stacking) using a few lines of code.\u00a0Hence, I have created a package named ensembleR, which can be accessed on CRAN. This package enables people to create ensemble of several models in R. To know more about ensembling in R,\u00a0read here.", "This package can create millions of unique ensembles (Stacked models) and give predictions using all of them within a single line of code. The current version on CRAN is the initial release of the package. You can find more details on how this package works here.", "The process of creating a package in R is both challenging as well as exciting, especially for the first time. I started off with learning the basic structure and process of creating a package.", "Once I coded the package, I learnt how to submit it on CRAN to make it available to other community members. Getting it on CRAN was the toughest part because of extensive and rigorous testing of the package, which is also responsible for maintaining the quality and consistency of packages that go on CRAN.", "In this article, I\u2019ll take you through the complete process of creating a package from scratch and getting it on CRAN and/ or GitHub to be made available publicly.", "The advantages for creating a R package are:", "Also, there are certain challenges also in creating a package:", "Before, beginning to write a package, there are few prerequisites you should be familiar with. These prerequisites are:", "Now let\u2019s get started with creating a simple package of our own. Within this package, we\u2019ll create a function to offer the functionality of predicting the stock price movement for tomorrow using simple logistic regression given the stock symbol. Simple enough. Let\u2019s begin!", "Now check the \u201cGenerate documentation with Roxygen\u201d option and put \u201c\u2013as-cran\u201d under Check Package space to simulate the CRAN package checking and testing.", "As you have successfully created a package in R, you\u2019ll like to share it with others to let them use the functions in your package. For the process of publishing a package, there are two popular platforms: CRAN and GitHub.", "Getting your package on CRAN is a difficult task due to the extensive and rigorous testing carried out on the packages before they can be published on CRAN. Along with passing these tests, you need to have comprehensive vignettes describing the working of your package. These vignettes will be stored in vignettes folder that you can create in the main project directory.", "Once you\u2019re sure that your package is doing well against the local simulation tests and is well documented, you need to create the source package by going to Build > Build Source Package.", "After the source package is created, you can then submit an application to publish it on CRAN here.", "Generally, a much easier way to make your package public is to publish it on GitHub. The simplest way to publish your package on GitHub is to create a new repository and upload the contents of the main folder (StockPredictor in our case) to that repository. I have done the same here.", "Now, anyone can install and use this package using the following command:", "I can\u2019t express how I feel after putting a package on CRAN. The usability of the package probably means very little to the outside world, but that is irrelevant. For me, I know that I have started the journey to make my favourite tool even stronger.", "After making the CRAN contribution, I have realised that it has helped me in number of ways:", "Hopefully, you would have found this\u00a0article helpful in creating your first open source package in R. Based on my experience, I\u2019ll like to make a few\u00a0useful suggestions:", "I believe this article would have given you a good understanding of the process involved in creating your own packages in R from scratch.
