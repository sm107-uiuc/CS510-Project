Please note that the examples shown could have alternate ways of getting same results, especially by using meta characters such as \u201c/d\u201d for \u201c[0-9]\u201d representing digits. In most of the examples, expressive and simplistic patterns are used here just for clarity and understandability.", "A sample code for more elaborate phone number is as follows:", "The date pattern used above are only numeric. There are other usages such as \u201927-Mar-1973\u2032 or \u201927 March 1973\u2032. I would leave this as an open quiz and would want the panelist to think about their RegEx patterns!!", "Citations in search papers or judgments have pre-defined formats and they refer to an external document.

After good enough practice one can directly code the search patterns in the program itself.", "All the RegEx patterns used here, with some minor modifications, can be used in programming language like Python, Perl, Java, etc. It can also be used in some of the popular text editors for Find-Replace functionality, like Microsoft Word (keep \u201cUse Wildcard\u201d option ON), OpenOffice and in IDEs like PyCharm.
