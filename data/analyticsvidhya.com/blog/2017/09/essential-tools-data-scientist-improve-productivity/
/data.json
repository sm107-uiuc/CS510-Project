There people are inquisitive about what kind of \u201cstack\u201d people currently working on? Their intention here is to find which tools are trending and what are the pros and cons while using it. Its because each and everyday new tools come out which try to eliminate the nagging problems people face everyday.", "In data science, I can probably say that there is more inclination on what kinds of techniques you use to solve a problem rather than the tools to use. Still, its wise to get to know what kind of tools are available to you. A survey was done keeping this in mind. Below image summarizes these findings.", "Instead of blatantly saying which the tools to be used, I will give you a rundown of these tools with a practical example. We will do this exercise on \u201cIdentify the Digits\u201d practice problem.", "Let us first get to know what the problem entails. The home page mentions \u201cHere, we need to identify the digit in given images. We have total 70,000 images, out of which 49,000 are part of train images with the label of digit and rest 21,000 images are unlabeled (known as test images). Now, we need to identify the digit for test images.\u201d", "This essentially means that the problem is an image recognition problem.The first step here would be to setup your system for the problem. I usually create a specific folder structure for each problem I start (yes I\u2019m a windows user \ud83d\ude10 ) and start working from there.", "For this kind of problems, I have a tendency to use the kit mentioned below:", "Fortunately, most of the things above can be accessed using a single software called Anaconda. I\u2019m accustomed to using Anaconda because of its comprehensiveness of data science packages and ease of use.", "To setup anaconda in your system, you have to simply download the appropriate version for your platform. More specifically, I have the python 3.6 version of anaconda 4.4.0.", "Now to use the newly install python ecosystem, open the anaconda command prompt and type \u201cpython\u201d", "As I said earlier,most of the things come pre-installed in anaconda. The only libraries left are tensorflow and keras. A smart thing to do here which anaconda provides a feature for is creating an environment. You do this because even if you do something wrong when setting up, it won\u2019t affect your original system. This is like creating a sandbox for all your experiments. To do this, go to the anaconda command prompt and type", "Now not install , the remaining packages by typing", "Now you can start writing your codes in your favorite text editor and run the python scripts!", "The problem in working with a plain text editor is that each time you update something, you have to run the code from the start again. Suppose you have a small code for reading data and processing. The code for data reading is functioning correctly but takes an hour to run. Now if you try to change the code for processing, you have to wait for the code for data reading to run and then see if your update works. This is tiresome and it wastes your time a lot.", "To get over this issue, you can use jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks essentially save your progress and let you continue from where you left off. Here you can write your code in a structured way so that you can resume the code and update it whenever you want to.", "In the section above, you had setup your system with anaconda software. As I mentioned, anaconda has jupyter preinstalled in it. To open jupyter notebook,\u00a0 open the anaconda prompt, go to the directory that you created and type", "This opens up jupyter notebook in you web browser (Mozilla Firefox for me). Now to create a notebook, click on \u201cNew\u201d-> \u201cPython 3\u201d", "Now what i usually do is divide the code into small blocks of code, so that it would be easier for me to debug. I always keep these in mind when I write code:", "Here is a sample of code I wrote to solve the deep learning problem mentioned. You can follow along if you like!", "A data science project requires multiple iterations of experimentation and testing. It is very difficult to remember all the things you tried out, which one of those worked and which did not.", "One method to control this issue is to take notes of all the experiments that you did and summarize them. But this too is a bit tedious and manual work. A workaround for this (and my personal choice) is to use GitHub. Originally GitHub was used as a code sharing platform for software engineers, but now it is gradually being accepted by the data science community. What GitHub does is provides you with a framework for saving all the changes you did in the code and reverting back to it anytime you want. This gives you the flexibility that you need to do a data science project efficiently.", "I will give you an example of how to use GitHub. But first, let us install it in our system. Go to the download link and click on the version as per your system. Let it download and then install it.", "This will install git in your system, along with command prompt for it called git bash. The next step is to configure the system with your git account. Once you have signed up for GitHub, you can use this to setup your system. Open up you git bash and type the following commands.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "Now there\u2019s two tasks you have to do.", "To accomplish the tasks, follow on to the steps mentioned below", "Step 1: Add a new repository on GitHub", "Step 2: Give proper descriptions to setup the repository.", "Step 3: Get link to the repository", "Step 4: Connect you local repository with the repository on GitHub with the commands below.", "Now if you want GitHub to ignore the changes in the files you can mention them in .gitignore file. Open it and add the file or folder you want to ignore.", "Now each time you want to save your progress, run these commands again", "This will ensure that you can go back to where you left off!", "Jupyter notebooks are very helpful for our experimentations. But what if you wanted to multiple experiments at the same time? You would have to wait for the previous command to finish before you can run another one.", "I usual have many ideas that I want to test out. And there are times I want to scale up. I use the company\u2019s deep learning box we built a few months back. So I prefer to use tmux for it. tmux or Terminal Multiplexer lets you switch easily between several programs in the same terminal. Here is my command center right now \ud83d\ude42", "We setup Ubuntu in the monster because it seemed like a good idea at that time. Setting up tmux in your system is pretty easy, you just have to install it using the command below", "To open tmux, type \u201ctmux\u201d in your command line.", "To make a new window, just press control + B and then shift + 5", "Now if you want to let this experiment continue and do something else, just type", "and it will give you the terminal again. And if you want to come back to the experiment again, type", "As simple as that! Note that setting up tmux in windows is a bit different. You can refer this article to set it up in your system.", "Now after all the implementations are done, we still have to deploy the solutions so that the end user such as a developer can access it. But the issue we always face is that the system we have might not be the same as that of the user. There will always be installation and setting up issues in their system.", "This is a very big problem when it comes to deployment of products in market. So to curb this issue, you can rely on a tool called docker. Docker is works on the idea that you can package code along with its dependencies into a self-contained unit. This unit can then be distributed to the end user.", "I usually do toy problems on my local machine, but when it comes to final solutions, I rely on the monster. I had setup docker in that system using these commands", "Integrating GPU on docker has some additional steps:", "Now comes the main part, installing DL libraries on docker. We built the docker from scratch, following this excellent guide (https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker/blob/master/README.md)", "To run your code on docker, open your docker\u2019s command prompt using the command", "Now whenever I have a complete working model, I throw it in the docker system to try it out on scale. You can use the dockerfile in a different system to install the same softwares and libraries in their system. This ensures that there isn\u2019t any installation problem.", "To conclude these are the tools I use and their usages", "Hope these tools will help you in your experiments too!", "In this article, I have covered what I feel are the necessarily tools for doing a data science project. To summarize, I use Python environment in anaconda stack, Jupyter notebooks for experimentations, Github for saving the crucial experiments, Tmux for running multiple experiments at once, and docker for deployment.", "If you have any more tools to suggest or if you use a completely different stack, do let me know in the comments below!", "Faizan is a Data Science enthusiast and a Deep learning rookie.
