It is their focus on application of data science. The best data scientists I know of, see data science and its application every where they look. They look at this world as an outcome of flow of data and information.", "On the other hand, most beginners often ask the question \u2013 how do we apply our learning on real life problems?", "In this post (and another one following this), I have picked up a real life dataset (Stock Markets in India) and showed how I would use this data to come out with useful insights.", "I hope that you will find this useful. The idea is show the vast opportunities present in data science in a simple yet powerful manner. If you can think of more examples like this \u2013 let me know in comments below!", "For the best results, I would strongly recommend to build the application yourself as you follow the tutorial.", "In this article, we will analyze stock market in banking segment based on the bank stocks which are listed in NSE India. Our objective is to find the trends (Seasonal or cyclic) in banking stocks.", "In our comparative analysis we will use several packages and the primary focus will be on tidy verse package. The emphasis will be given on grouping with the help of tibble dataframe from tidy verse package. This will help to perform similar operation on multiple groups at a time, hence reducing the code length and computational time.", "This article also focuses on API Key, database code search using quandl, and finally how to directly download the data from R Console.", "Note: The code that has been mentioned below is to be run on the R command line for best results.", "There are a few things you should take care of before you go on further. Below mentioned are the packages you need to install in the system", "If you don\u2019t have any of the packages, then use the below code to install the packages. Modify the packages variable if any of the above packages are already installed.", "You can then call the necessary packages using the code below", "We will be using Quandl is online repository for the core financial, macroeconomic statistics and forex. Quandl has a vast collection of free and open data collected from a variety of organizations: central banks, governments, multinational organizations and more. You can use it without payment and with few restrictions.", "Both Free and Premium data are available.

We will use the following codes to get the data into R console.", "The parameters we use are as follows:", "Now we will download the data, add a column \u201cStock\u201d for the stock identifier, and then we paste the respective stock name in the downloaded dataset. We will then consolidate all stock data into one Master Data frame for analysis", "Let us look at Monthly and Daily price pattern for Stocks using ggplot package. For this we will need to group the master dataframe according by Stock.", "We have heavily manipulated the theme section of ggplot to get the desired plot. More information on plot is provided here.", "Usually, traded quantity increases if the stock price increases or decreases too rapidly on a given day. This parameter is important for our model for prediction. So we should take some time out to identify the relation between them in our data.", "We have an idea of trend of the stock price, but not much is clear from the Monthly prices. Axis Bank share price improved in september and stayed at Rs750 for a month. whereas all other Banks were consistent and did not show much of volatility.", "Now we will see the density distribution of High Price from Open Price in order to get an understanding that how much price is deviating in either direction (North or South) on weekly basis. This gives us an idea of price range for any stock in intraday trading.", "We will use the transmute_tq() function from tidyquant package to compute the weekly prices. Please click here to get more information.", "For this add a new column with the difference of high and open price using mutate function. Add another new column with the difference of low and open price using mutate function. Calculate the weekly average of differences using \u201ctq_transmute()\u201d function from tidyverse package. Visualize both density plots with dot distribution on ggplot", "The lag operator (also known as backshift operator) is a function that shifts (offsets) a time series such that the \u201clagged\u201d values are aligned with the actual time series. The lags can be shifted any number of units, which simply controls the length of the backshift.", "Here, \u201ck\u201d is denoted as lag. We will see the lag of 180 days period and see how stocks behave.", "These are the steps for Computation", "Its apparent from the ACF plot, that there is no weekly or monthly pattern.", "This article contains descriptive analysis of stocks in terms of Daily/Weekly Price fluctuations. It also includes analysis on deviation from High and Low Price. The focus is also given on the relationship between the daily traded quantity of shares & close price and to check for the relationship. In the later part, the main focus is on xts package for the computation of Auto-correaltion. In the article, the focus is provided on finding lag and acf plot using ggplot rather than using the conventional time series package.
