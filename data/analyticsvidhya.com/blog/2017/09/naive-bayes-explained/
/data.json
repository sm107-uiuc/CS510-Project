Within an hour, stakeholders want to see the first cut of the model.", "What will you do? You have hundreds of thousands of data points and several variables in your training data set. In such a situation, if I were in your place, I would have used \u2018Naive Bayes,\u2018 which can be extremely fast relative to other\u00a0classification algorithms. It works on Bayes\u2019 theorem of probability to predict the class of unknown data sets.", "In this article, I\u2019ll explain the basics of Naive Bayes (NB) in machine learning (ML), so that the next time you come across large data sets, you can bring this classification algorithm in ML (which is a part of AI) to action. In addition, if you are a newbie in\u00a0Python or R, you should not be overwhelmed by the presence of available codes in this article.", "If you prefer to learn the Naive Bayes\u2019 theorem from the basics concepts to the implementation in a structured manner, you can enroll in this free course:", "Are you a beginner in Machine Learning?

Human resources have been using analytics for years.", "However, the collection, processing, and analysis of data have been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game. Here is an opportunity to try predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.", "It is a classification technique based on\u00a0Bayes\u2019 Theorem with an independence assumption among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.", "For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as \u2018Naive\u2019.", "An NB model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets.
