That also means that we need a lot of data to build our image classifiers or sales forecasters. The algorithms search patterns through the data again and again.", "But, that is not how human mind learns. A human brain does not require millions of data for training with multiple iterations of going through the same image for understanding a topic. All it needs is a few guiding points to train itself on the underlying patterns. Clearly, we are missing something in current machine learning approaches.", "Thankfully, there is a line of research which specifically caters to this question. Can we build a system capable of requiring minimal amount of supervision which can learn majority of the tasks on its own. In this article, I would like to cover one such technique called pseudo-labelling. I will give an intuitive explanation of what pseudo-labelling is and then provide a hands-on implementation of it.", "Note: I assume you have clarity on the basic topics of machine learning. If not, I would suggest you to go through\u00a0a basic machine learning article first and then come back to this one.", "Let\u2019s say, we have a simple image classification problem. So, our training data consists of two labelled images as shown below.", "So, we need to classify images of eclipse from the non-eclipse images. But, the problem is that we need to build our model on just a training set of just two images.", "Therefore, in order to apply any supervised learning algorithm we need more data to build a robust model. To solve this purpose, we find a simple solution that we download some images from the web to increase our training data.", "But, for the supervised approach we also need labels for these images. So, we manually classify each image into a category as shown below.", "After running supervised algorithm on this data, our model will definitely out-perform the model just containing two images in the training data.", "But this approach is only valid for small purposes because human annotation to a large dataset can be very hard and expensive.", "So, to solve these type of problems, we define a different type of learning known as semi-supervised learning, which is used both labelled data (supervised learning) and unlabelled data (unsupervised learning).", "Therefore, let us understand how unlabelled data can help to improve our model.", "Consider a situation as shown below.", "\nYou have only two data points belonging to two different categories, and the line drawn is the decision boundary of any supervised model.", "Now, let\u2019s say we add some unlabelled data to this data as shown in the image below.", "If we notice the difference between the above two images, you can say that after adding unlabelled data, the decision boundary of our model has become more accurate.", "So, the advantage of using unlabelled data are:", "Now, we have a basic understanding that what is semi-supervised learning. There are different techniques of applying SSL, in this article we will try to understand one such technique known as Pseudo Labeling.", "In this technique, instead of manually labeling the unlabelled data, we give approximate labels on the basis of the labelled data. Let\u2019s make it simpler by breaking into steps as shown in the image below.", "I suppose, you understood the steps mentioned in the above image. So, the final model trained in the third step is used for the final predictions on the test data.", "For better understanding, I always prefer understanding a concept by its implementation on a real world problem.", "Here, we will be using Big Mart Sales problem from AV data hack platform. So, let\u2019s get start by downloading the train and test file present in the data section.", "So, let\u2019s get start by importing the basic libraries.", "Now, let\u2019s read train and test file that we have downloaded and do some basic preprocessing in order to form modelling.", "Starting with different supervised learning algorithm, let us check which algorithm gives us the best results.", "We can see XGB gives us the best model performance. Note here, I have not tuned parameter of any algorithm for the simplicity of this article.", "Now, let\u2019s us implement Pseudo-labelling, for this purpose I will be using test data as the unlabelled data. ", "This look quite complex, but you need not to worry about this as it is the same implementation of the method we learned above. So, copy the same code every time you need to perform pseudo labeling.", "So, now let\u2019s us now check the results of pseudo labeling on the dataset.", "In this case, we a get rmse value which comes out to lesser than any of the supervised learning algorithm.", "If you have notice sample_rate was one of the parameter, which denotes the percentage of unlabelled data to be used as the pseudo labelled for the modelling purpose.", "Therefore, let\u2019s us check the dependance of sample_rate on the performance of the pseudo labelling.", "In order to find out the dependence of sample_rate on the performance of the pseudo labelling, let us plot a graph between those two.", "Here, I am using only two algorithm to show you the dependence because of the time constraint, but you can try for other algorithms too.", "So, we can see that the rmse is minimum for a particular value of sample_rate, which is different for both the algorithm.", "Therefore, it is important to tune sample_rate in order to achieve better results while using pseudo labeling.", "In past, there are limited number of applications of semi-supervised learning, but currently there is lot of working going on in this field.", "Some applications which I found interesting are listed below.", "Generally, in image categorisation, the goal is to classify an image whether it belongs to the category or not. In this paper, not only images are used for modelling but the keywords associated with labelled and unlabelled images are also used to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning.", "Human trafficking is one of the most atrocious crimes and among the challenging problems facing law enforcement which demands attention of global magnitude. Semi-supervised learning is to applied to use both labelled and unlabelled data in order to produce better results than the normal approaches.", "I hope that now you have a understanding what semi-supervised learning is and how to implement it in any real world problem.
