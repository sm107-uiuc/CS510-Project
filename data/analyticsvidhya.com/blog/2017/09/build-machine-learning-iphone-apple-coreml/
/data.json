The hacker in me wanted to get my hands dirty and figure out what it takes to build a system like that? ", "When probed further, the answer was CoreML which is Apple\u2019s official machine learning kit for developers. It works with iPhone, Macbook, Apple TV, Apple watch, in short, every Apple device.", "Another interesting announcement was that Apple has designed a custom GPU and an advanced processing chip A11 Bionic with a neural engine optimised for Machine Learning in the latest iPhones. ", "With a powerful computing engine at its core, the iPhone will now be open to new avenues of machine learning and the significance of CoreML will only rise in the coming days.", "By end of this article, you will see what Apple CoreML is and why it is gaining the momentum. We will also look into implementation details of CoreML by building a message spam classification app for iPhone. ", "We will finish off the article by objectively looking at pros and cons of the same. ", "Apple launched CoreML this year in their annual developer conference WWDC(which is equivalent of Google I/O conference) with a lot of hype. In order to better understand CoreML\u2019s role, we have to know a bit of context.", "Interestingly this is not the first time that Apple has come out with a framework for machine learning on its devices. Last year it launched a bunch of libraries for the same:", "The point of difference was, one was optimized for CPU while the other was optimized for the GPU. The reason for this is sometimes during inference the CPU can be faster than the GPU. While during training almost every time GPU is faster.", "These multiple frameworks created a lot of confusion among developers and since they were quite close to the hardware(for high performance), they were difficult to program in.", "CoreML provides another layer of abstraction over the previous two libraries and gives an easy interface to achieve the same level of efficiency. Another benefit is that CoreML takes care of context switching between the CPU and GPU itself while your app is running. ", "That is to say, for example, you have a memory heavy task that involves dealing with text (natural language processing), CoreML will automatically run it on the CPU whereas if you have compute heavy tasks like image classification, it will use the GPU. If you have both the functionalities in your app, it will also take care of that automatically so that you can get best of both the worlds.", "CoreML also comes with three libraries built on top of it :", "All of the above libraries, again are very easy to use and provide a simple interface to do a bunch of tasks. With the above libraries, the final structure of CoreML would look something like this", "Notice that the above design gives a nice modular structure to your iOS application. You have different layers for different tasks and you can make use of them in a variety of ways (for example, using NLP with image classification in your app). You can read more about these libraries here : Vision, Foundation and GameplayKit. Well, that was enough theory for now, it is time to get our hands dirty!", "To make full use of the CoreML , you need the following requirements set up:", "Once you log in, you will have to verify your apple ID. You will receive the notification regarding the same on the device that is registered with your apple ID.", "Select \u201cAllow\u201d and type the given 6 digit passcode in the website ", "Once you do this step, you will be shown a download option and you can download Xcode from there.\u00a0Now that we have set up our system and all ready let\u2019s move on to the implementation part!", "We will be looking at two important ways to utilize the power of CoreML by building them. Let\u2019s start then!", "Now, one of the strengths of CoreML or rather should I say wise decision of its creators was to support conversion of trained machine learning models built in other popular frameworks like sklearn, caffe, xgboost etc. ", "This didn\u2019t alienate the data science community from trying out CoreML because they can experiment, train their models in their favourite environment and then simply import it to use in their iOS/MacOS app.", " The following are the frameworks that CoreML supports right out of the box:", "In order to make the conversion process simple, Apple designed its own open format for representing cross framework machine learning models called mlmodel. This model file contains a description of the layers in your model, the inputs and outputs, the class labels, and any preprocessing that needs to be done on the data. It also contains all the learned parameters (the weights and biases).", "The conversion flow looks like this :", "For this example, we will be building a spam message classifier in sklearn and then port the same model to CoreML.", "The SMS Spam Collection v.1 is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research. It has one collection composed by 5,574 English, real and non-encoded messages, tagged according to being legitimate (ham) or spam. ", "You can download the dataset from here.", "We will be building a basic model using LinearSVC in sklearn. Also, I have used TF-IDF on the text of the message as a feature for the model. TF-IDF is a technique used in natural language processing that helps classify documents based on words that uniquely identify a document over other. If you would like to learn more about NLP and tf-idf, you can read this article. This would be the code for that: ", "That builds our model. Let\u2019s test it with a spam message,", "Interesting, our model works well! let\u2019s add some cross-validation too,", "Now that we have built our model, we need to port it to .mlmodel format in order to make it compatible with CoreML. We will use the coremltools package that we installed earlier for that. The following code would convert our model into .mlmodel format", "We first import the coremltools package in python. Then we use one of the converters to convert our model, in this case, we used converters.sklearn because we have to convert a model built in sklearn. We then pass the model object, input variable name, and the output variable name in .convert(). We then set the parameters of the model to add more info about the inputs, outputs and finally call .save() to save our model file.", "When you double click on the model file, it should open in a Xcode window. ", "As you can see, the model file shows details about the type of model, its inputs, and outputs, their types etc. I have highlighted all this information in the above figure. You can match the description with the ones we provided while converting to .mlmodel. ", "That is how easy it is to import your model into CoreML. Now your model is into Apple ecosystem, that\u2019s when the real fun starts!", "Note: The complete code file for this step can be found here. Read more about coremltools here and different types of converters available here.", "Now that we have trained our model and ported it to CoreML, let us use that model and build a spam classifier app for iPhone!", "We would be running our app on a simulator. A simulator is a software that shows how an app will look and work as if it was really running on the phone. This saves a lot of time because we can experiment with our code and fix all bugs before trying the app on an actual phone. Have a look at what the end product would be like:", "I have already built a basic UI for our app and it is available on GitHub. Use the following commands to get it up and running:", "This will open our project using Xcode. ", "I have highlighted three main regions in the Xcode window :", "Let\u2019s first run our app and see what happens. Click on the play button on the top left that will run our app in the simulator. Try typing some text in the box and clicking on the Predict button. What happens?", "For now, our app doesn\u2019t do much it just prints whatever has been typed in the box. \u00a0", "Here is the whole process for reference :", "Before we can start making inferences from our model, we need to tell Xcode to compile the model during the build stage. For that follow the following steps:", "Now every time we run our app, Xcode will compile our machine learning model so that it can be used for making predictions.", "Any application that is to be developed for an Apple device is programmed in swift. For following this tutorial you don\u2019t need to learn swift but if afterward it interests you and you want to go deeper, you can follow this tutorial.", "The above code checks whether the user has entered any message in the text box. If he has, it calculates the tfidf of the text by calling a function tfidf(). It then creates an object of our SpamMessageClassifier and then calls the .prediction() function. This is equivalent of .predict() in sklearn. It then displays an appropriate message based on the prediction.", "Remember that we trained our model based on tf-idf representation of text so our model expects the input in the same format. Once we get the message entered in the text box we are calling tfidf() function on it to do the same. Let\u2019s write code for it, copy the following code just below the predictSpam() function:", "The above code finds the tfidf representation of the message entered in the text box for that it reads the original dataset file SMSSpamCollection.txt and returns the same. Once you save the program and re-run the simulator, your app should be working fine now.", "Like every library in development, it has its pros and cons. Let us state them explicitly.", "In this article, we learned more about CoreML and its application in building a machine learning app for iPhone. CoreML is a relatively new library and hence has its own share of pros and cons. A very useful feature provided here is it runs on the device locally thus giving more speed and providing data privacy. At the same time, it can\u2019t be thought of as a full-fledged data scientist friendly library yet. We will have to wait and see how does it evolve in the coming releases.", "For those of you who got stuck at some step, all of the code for this article is available on GitHub.", "Also, if you want to explore CoreML in more depth these are some of the resources:", "A computer science graduate, I have previously worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Southern California(USC-ICT) where I employed NLP and ML to make better virtual STEM mentors.
