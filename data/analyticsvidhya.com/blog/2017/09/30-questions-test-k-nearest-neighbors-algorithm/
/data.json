Both are simple to explain and demonstrate, making them perfect for those who are new to the field. For beginners, it is crucial to test their knowledge of these algorithms as they are simplistic yet immensely powerful. These are commonly asked in interviews as well. Searching for kNN interview questions and practicing them can help one gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its practical applications. In this article we are explaining top 30 kNN interview questions!", "The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples.In the testing phase, a test point is classified by assigning the label which are most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that query point \u2013 hence higher computation.", "Validation error is the least when the value of k is 10. So it is best to use this value of k", "A) ManhattanB) MinkowskiC) TanimotoD) JaccardE) MahalanobisF) All can be used", "All of these distance metric can be used as a distance metric for k-NN.", "A) It can be used for classificationB) It can be used for regressionC) It can be used in both classification and regression", "We can also use k-NN for regression problems. In this case the prediction can be based on the mean or the median of the k-most similar instances.", "The above mentioned statements are assumptions of kNN algorithm", "A) K-NNB) Linear RegressionC) Logistic Regression", "k-NN algorithm can be used for imputing missing value of both categorical and continuous variables.", "A) It can be used for continuous variablesB) It can be used for categorical variablesC) It can be used for categorical as well as continuousD) None of these", "Manhattan Distance is designed for calculating the distance between real valued features.", "Both Euclidean and Manhattan distances are used in case of continuous variables, whereas hamming distance is used in case of categorical variable.", "Suppose, you have given the following data where x and y are the 2 input variables and Class is the dependent variable.", "All three nearest point are of +class so this point will be classified as +class.", "Now this point will be classified as \u2013 class because there are 4 \u2013 class and 3 +class point are in nearest circle.", "Suppose you have given the following 2-class data where \u201c+\u201d represent a postive class and \u201c\u201d is represent negative class.", "5-NN will have least leave one out cross validation error.", "In 5-NN we will have\u00a0 10/14 leave one out cross validation accuracy.", "large K means simple model, simple model always condider as high bias", "Simple model will be consider as less variance model", "Left is the graphical depiction of how euclidean distance works, whereas right one is of Manhattan distance.", "To be more sure of which classifications you make, you can try increasing the value of k.", "In such case you can use either dimensionality reduction algorithm or the feature selection algorithm", "Both are true and self explanatory", "If you keep the value of k as 2, it gives the lowest cross validation accuracy. You can try this out yourself.", "In an overfitted module, it seems to be performing well on training data, but it is not generalized enough to give the same results on a new data.", "Both the options are true and are self explanatory.", "Option A: This is not always true. You have to ensure that the value of k is not too high or not too low.", "Option B: This statement is not true. The decision boundary can be a bit jagged", "Option C: Same as option B", "Option D: This statement is true", "You can implement a 2-NN classifier by ensembling 1-NN classifiers", "The value of N is very large, so option A is correct", "The training time for any value of k in  kNN algorithm  is the same.", "Here are some resources to get in depth knowledge in the subject.", "If you are just getting started with Machine Learning and Data Science, here is a course to assist you in your journey to Master Data Science and Machine Learning. Check out the detailed course structure in the link below:", "Being prepared for kNN interview questions is crucial for anyone looking to enter the field of data science or machine learning. Understanding the basics of the kNN algorithm, its practical applications, and how to handle technical questions can help you demonstrate your knowledge and problem-solving skills. By practicing kNN interview questions and working through example problems, you can improve your understanding and feel more confident during the interview process. With these tips in mind, you can approach kNN interviews with confidence and set yourself up for success in your data science career.", "I am a Business Analytics and Intelligence professional with deep experience in the Indian Insurance industry.
