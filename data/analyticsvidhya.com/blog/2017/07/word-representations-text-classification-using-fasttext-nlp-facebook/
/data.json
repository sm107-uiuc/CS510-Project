It is all the more important to capture the context in which the word has been used. This is a common problem in Natural Processing Language (NLP) tasks.", "A single word with the same spelling and pronunciation (homonyms) can be used in multiple contexts and a potential solution to the above problem is computing word representations.", "Now, imagine the challenge for Facebook.\u00a0Facebook deals with enormous amount of text data on a daily basis in the form of status updates, comments etc. And it is all the more important for Facebook to utilise this text data to serve its users better. And using this text data generated by billions of users to compute word representations was a very time expensive task until Facebook developed their own library FastText, for Word Representations and Text Classification.", "In this article, we will see how we can calculate Word Representations and perform Text Classification, all in a matter of seconds in comparison to the existing methods which took days to achieve the same performance.", "FastText is a library created by the Facebook Research Team for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification.", "This library has gained a lot of traction in the NLP community and is a possible substitution\u00a0to the gensim package which provides the functionality of Word Vectors etc. If you are new to the Word Vectors and word representations in general then, I suggest you read this article first.", "But the question that we should be really asking is \u2013 How is FastText different from gensim Word Vectors?", "FastText differs in the sense that word vectors a.k.a word2vec treats every single word as the smallest unit whose vector representation is to be found but FastText assumes a word to be formed by a n-grams of character, for example, sunny is composed of [sun, sunn,sunny],[sunny,unny,nny] \u00a0etc, where n could range from 1 to the length of the word.

We will see each of these steps in detail. Let us get started with learning word representations.", "Words in their natural form cannot be used for any Machine Learning task in general. One way to use the words is to transform these words into some representations that capture some attributes of the word. It is analogous to describing a person as \u2013 [\u2018height\u2019:5.10 ,\u2019weight\u2019:75, \u2018colour\u2019:\u2019dusky\u2019, etc.] where height, weight etc are the attributes of the person. Similarly, word representations capture some abstract attributes of words in the manner that similar words tend to have similar word representations.

Sentiment analysis and email classification are classic examples of text classification. In this era of technology, millions of digital documents are being generated each day. It would cost a huge amount of time as well as human efforts to categorise them in reasonable categories like spam and non-spam, important and unimportant and so on.
