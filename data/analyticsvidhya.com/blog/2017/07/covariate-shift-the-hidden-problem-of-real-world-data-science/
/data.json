This poses a problem in solving real life problems."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/submissions?sortBy=date&group=all&page=1", "anchor_text": "Sberbank Russian Housing Market", "paragraph_index": 25}], "all_paragraphs": ["You may have heard from various people that data science competitions are a good way to learn data science, but they are not as useful in solving real\u00a0world data science problems. Why do you think this is the case?", "One of the differences lies in the quality of data that has been provided. In Data Science Competitions, the datasets are carefully curated. Usually, a single large dataset is split into train and test file. So, most of the times the train and test have been generated from the same distribution.", "But this is not the case when dealing with real world problems, especially when the data has been collected over a long period of time. In such cases, there may be multiple variables / environment changes might have happened during that period. If proper care is not taken then, the training dataset cannot be used to predict anything about the test dataset in a usable manner.", "In this article, we will see the different types of problems or Dataset Shift that we might encounter in the real world. Specifically, we will be talking in detail about one particular kind of shift in the Dataset (Covariate shift), the existing methods to deal with this kind of shift and an in depth demonstration of a particular method to correct this shift.", "Every\u00a0time you\u00a0participate in a competition, your journey will\u00a0look\u00a0quite\u00a0similar to the one shown in the figure below.", "Let me explain this with the help of a scenario depicted in the picture below. You are given a train and a test file in a competition. You complete the preprocessing, the feature engineering and the cross validation part on the model created but you do not get the same result as the one you get on the cross-validation. No matter what validation strategy you try, it seems like you are bound to get different results in comparison to the cross validation.", "What can be a possible reason for this failure? So, if you carefully notice the first picture, you will find that you did all the manipulation by just\u00a0looking\u00a0at the train file. Therefore, you completely ignored\u00a0the information contained in the test file.", "Now take a look back on the second picture, you will notice that the training file contains information about male and females of fairly younger age while the test file contains information about people of older age. Therefore it means that the distribution of data contained in the train and test file is significantly different.", "So, if you\u00a0build\u00a0your model based\u00a0on the data set containing information about people having lower age and predict on a data set containing\u00a0higher values of age, that will definitely give you a low score. The reason is that\u00a0there will a wide gap in the interest and the activities\u00a0between these two groups.\u00a0So your model will fail in these conditions.", "This change in the distribution of data contained in train and test file is called dataset shift\u00a0(or drifting).", "Try to think some of the examples, where you can encounter the problem of dataset shift.", "Basically, in the real world, dataset shift mainly occurs because of the change of environments\u00a0(popularly called as non-stationary environment), where the environment can be referred as location, time, etc.", "Let us consider\u00a0an example. We collected the sales of\u00a0various\u00a0item\u00a0during the period of July-September. Now your job is to predict the sales during the period of Diwali.\u00a0The visual representation of sales in the train (blue line) and test (black line) file would be similar to the image\u00a0shown below.", "Clearly, the sales during the time of\u00a0Diwali\u00a0would be much higher as compared to routine days.\u00a0Therefore\u00a0we can say that\u00a0it is the situation of dataset shift, which occurred due to change of time period between our train and test file.", "But our machine learning algorithms work by ignoring these changes. They presume that the train and test environments match and even if they don\u2019t, it assumes that it makes no difference\u00a0if the environment changes.", "Now take a look back at both of the examples that we discussed above. Is there any difference between\u00a0them?", "Yes, in the first\u00a0scenario, there was a shift in the\u00a0age\u00a0(independent variable or predictor)\u00a0of the population due to which we were getting wrong predictions. While in the latter one, there was a shift in the\u00a0sales\u00a0(target variable)\u00a0of the items. This brings the next topic to the table \u2013 Different types of Dataset shifts.", "Dataset shift could be divided into\u00a0three types:", "In this article, we will discuss only covariate shift in this article since the other two topics are still an active research area and there has not been any substantial work to mitigate these problems.", "We will also see the methods to identify Covariate shift and the proper measures that can be taken in order to improve the predictions.", "Covariate\u00a0shift\u00a0refers to the change in the distribution of the input variables present in the training and the test data. It is the most common type of shift and it is now gaining more attention as nearly every real-world dataset suffers from this problem.", "First, let us try to understand how does the\u00a0change in distribution creates a problem for us. Take a look at the image shown below.", "If you carefully notice the image given above, our learning function tries to fit the training data. But here, we can see that the distribution of training and test is different, so predicting using this learned function will definitely\u00a0give us wrong predictions.", "So our first step should be to\u00a0identify this shift in the distribution. Let\u2019s try and understand it.", "Here, I have used a quick and dirty machine learning technique to check whether there is a shift\u00a0between the training data and the test data.", "For this purpose, I will use\u00a0Sberbank Russian Housing Market\u00a0dataset from Kaggle.", "The basic idea to identify shift \u2013\u00a0If there exists a shift in the dataset, then on mixing the train and test file, you should still be able to classify an instance of the mixed dataset as train or test with reasonable accuracy. Why?", "Because, if the features in both the dataset belong to different distributions then, they should be able to separate the dataset into train and test file significantly.", "Let\u2019s try to make it simple. Take a look at the distribution of the feature \u2018id\u2019 in both the\u00a0dataset.", "By looking at their\u00a0distribution, we can clearly see that after a certain value (=30,473), all the instances will belong to test dataset.", "So if we create a dataset which is a mixture of training and test instances, where we have\u00a0labelled each instance of training data as \u2018training\u2019 and test as \u2018test\u2019 before mixing.", "In this new dataset,\u00a0if we\u00a0just look\u00a0at the\u00a0feature \u2018id\u2019, we can clearly classify\u00a0any\u00a0instance\u00a0that\u00a0whether it belongs\u00a0to training data or test data. Therefore,\u00a0we can\u00a0conclude\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018id\u2019 is a drifting feature for this dataset.", "So this was\u00a0fairly easy.\u00a0But we can\u2019t visualise every variable and check whether it is drifting or not. For that purpose,\u00a0let us try to code this in Python as a simple classification problem\u00a0and identify the drifting features.", "The basic steps that we will follow are:", "Note that\u00a0we generally take 0.80 as the threshold value, but the value can be altered based on the situation.", "So that is enough of theory, now let\u2019s code this and find which\u00a0of the\u00a0features are drifting in this problem.", "Here we have classified\u00a0seven\u00a0features as drifting.\u00a0You can also manually check their difference in\u00a0distribution\u00a0through some visualisation or by using 1-way\u00a0ANOVA\u00a0test.", "So, now the\u00a0important\u00a0question is how to treat them effectively such that we can improve our predictions.", "There are different techniques by which we can treat these features in order to improve our model. Let us\u00a0discuss some of them.", "So let\u2019s try to understand them.", "This method is quite simple, as in this, we basically drop the features which are being classified as drifting. But just give it a thought, that simply dropping features might result in some loss of information.", "To deal with this, we have defined a simple rule.", "Features having a drift value greater than 0.8 and are\u00a0not important\u00a0in our model, we drop them.", "So, let\u2019s try this in our problem.", "Here, I have used a basic random forest model just to check which features are important.", "# using a basic model with all the features\ntraining = train.drop('origin',axis=1)\ntesting = test.drop('origin',axis=1)", "On submitting this file on Kaggle, we are getting a\u00a0rmse\u00a0score of\u00a00.40116\u00a0on private leaderboard.", "So, let\u2019s check first 20\u00a0important features\u00a0for this model.", "Now, if we compare our drop list and feature importance, we will find that the features \u2018life_sq\u2019 and \u2018kitch_sq\u2019 are common.", "So, we will keep these two features in our model, while\u00a0dropping the\u00a0rest of the\u00a0drifting features.", "NOTE: Before dropping any feature, just make sure you\u00a0if there any possibility to create\u00a0a new feature from it.", "Let\u2019s try this and check whether it improves our prediction or not.", "On submission of this file on Kaggle, we got a\u00a0rmse\u00a0score of\u00a00.39759\u00a0on the private leaderboard.", "Congratulations,\u00a0we have successfully improved our performance\u00a0using this technique.", "In this method, the approach to\u00a0importance estimation would be to first estimate the training and test densities separately and then estimate the importance by taking the ratio of the estimated densities of test and train.", "Then these densities act as weights for each instance in the training data.", "But giving weights to each instance based on the density ratio could be a rigorous task in higher dimensional data sets. I tried this method on an i7 processor with 128 GB RAM and it took around 3 minutes to calculate the ratio density for a single feature. Also, I could not find any improvement in the score on applying the weights to the training data.", "Also scaling this feature for 200 features would be a very time-consuming task.", "Therefore, this method is only good up to research papers but the application of this in the real world is still questionable. Also, this is an active area of research.", "I hope that now you have a better understanding about drift, how you can identify it and treat it effectively. It\u00a0has now become a common problem in real world dataset. So you should develop a habit to check this every time while solving problems, and surely it will give you positive results.", "Did you find this article helpful?
