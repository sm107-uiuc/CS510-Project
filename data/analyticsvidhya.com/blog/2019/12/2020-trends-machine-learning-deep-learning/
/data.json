It\u2019s time to welcome the new year with a splash of machine learning sprinkled into our brand new resolutions. Machine learning will continue to be at the heart of what we do and how we do it.", "And what about 2019? What a year it has been! The sheer amount of developments we saw in Natural Language Processing (NLP) blew us away. It was the year of fine-tuning language models and frameworks like Google\u2019s BERT and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 (more of all of this later!).", "What we loved about 2019 was the community\u2019s embrace of open source releases. They have further lowered the access barriers into machine learning as more and more folks from the community aim to break into this field in 2020. Here\u2019s to all your ambitions and this wonderful career choice!", "So, as we get set for the new year, we wanted to take some time and pen down this wide-ranging and thought-provoking article. We will look at the top machine learning developments in 2019 in a technical review manner. We will also look at what we can expect from the different machine learning domains in 2020.", "And the cherry on top \u2013 hear from top machine learning experts and practitioners like Sudalai Rajkumar (SRK), Dat Tran, Sebastian Ruder and Xander Steenbrugge as they pick out their top trends in 2020!", "The rise of machine learning has disrupted multiple and diverse industries across the globe. In fact, our job roles and functions are getting impacted to a large extent right now (we\u2019re sure you can relate to this!).", "Executives, leaders, and CxOs are lining up to integrate machine learning solutions in their organizations. This was almost impossible a few years ago when businesses had to do a lot of things manually infrastructure wise. It\u2019s no coincidence that machine learning projects had a higher chance of failure in 2015 than in 2019.", "This uptick in machine learning investment (and board-level buy-in) has happened thanks in large part to the rise of cloud-based platforms. Yes, we\u2019re talking about Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, etc.", "These platforms have made adopting machine learning far easier than ever before thanks to their out-of-the-box solutions.", "Let\u2019s look at a few hardcore numbers by Forrester (taken from their report here):", "So, how do we see 2020 planning out for machine learning? The current level of investment and interest in this field will only intensify! That\u2019s great news for all you machine learning enthusiasts and freshers hoping to make a career in this field.", "As we\u2019ll see later in this article, the effort to integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) based applications will multiply in 2020. So far, we have seen a lot of research in this field \u2013 2020 should see that research become reality in the real-world.", "Picking the top trends from the Forrester report we mentioned above:", "Natural Language Processing took a giant leap in 2019. This is one domain that REALLY took off this year. The sheer amount of breakthroughs and developments that happened \u2013 unparalleled.", "2018 was a watershed year for NLP. 2019 was essentially about building on that and taking the field forward by leaps and bounds.", "If you\u2019re a newcomer to NLP and want to get started with this burgeoning field, I recommend checking out the below comprehensive course:", "And with that, let\u2019s check out the top NLP highlights from 2019!", "We got the Transformer architecture in 2017 from the \u201cAttention is all you Need\u201d paper. This eventually led to Google open-sourcing BERT, the State-of-Art NLP model. And ever since then, the Transformer has time and again ruled the latest SOTA results in the NLP space.", "Google\u2019s Transformer-XL, which was another Transformer based model, outperformed BERT in Language Modeling. This was followed by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 \u2013 a model that became famous for generating very realistic human-like text by itself:", "2019 saw many innovations on BERT itself, like CMU\u2019s XLNet, Facebook AI\u2019s RoBERTa and mBERT (multilingual BERT) in the latter part of the year.", "Transfer learning in NLP is another trend that picked up in 2019. We started seeing multiple language models that were pre-trained on large unlabelled text corpora thereby enabling them to learn the underlying nuances of language itself.", "These models can then be fine-tuned for almost any NLP task and would work well with comparatively fewer data. Major flag bearers for this trend were GPT-2, Transformer-XL, etc.", "There was good progress in the method of pre-training itself with models like Baidu\u2019s ERNIE 2.0 that introduced the concept of Continual pre-training. In this framework, different customized tasks can be incrementally introduced at any time:", "Another cool development in 2019 \u2013 the StanfordNLP library! This was open-sourced by Christopher Manning\u2019s StanfordNLP group. This library provides neural network-based models for common text processing tasks like POS tagging, NER, etc.", "This was aided by the launch of HuggingFace\u2019s Transformers library. This made huge waves in the community by providing pre-trained models for all the major SOTA models like BERT, XLNet, GPT-2 etc. in a simple Pythonic way.", "One of the major positive impacts it had was evident from the fact that spaCy utilized this library to create spacy-transformers, an industry-grade library for text processing that provides SOTA models like BERT, GPT-2, etc. for these tasks.", "The Stanford NLP library made it easier to deploy Transformer-based models into production.", "Going hand in hand with the large language models that we trained in 2019, there was also a focus towards optimizing these models.", "The issue with larger models like BERT, Transformer-XL, GPT-2 is that they are so compute-intensive, it\u2019s almost impractical to use them in a real-life product.", "DistilBERT by HuggingFace showed that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40% while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. This was a welcome surprise for the NLP community which was starting to believe that the only way to perform well in NLP is to train larger models:", "Another successful and intriguing approach to decrease the size of BERT models came in the form of ALBERT by Google and Toyota Research. ALBERT achieved SOTA on 3 NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SQuAD, RACE):", "The NLP community rekindled its interest in working with audio data with developments like NVIDIA\u2019s NeMo framework which makes it blazingly easy to train models for an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.", "These models are called end-to-end because they take speech samples (audio) as input and produce transcripts (text) without any additional information.", "Apart from NeMo, NVIDIA also open-sourced QuartzNet, another new end-to-end ASR model architecture based on Jasper, a small, highly efficient model for speech recognition:", "How can NLP be truly useful until it\u2019s able to work with multilingual data?", "This year saw a renewed interest in exploring multilingual avenues of NLP libraries like StanfordNLP that came with pre-trained models for processing text in 50+ human languages. This, as you can imagine, made a huge impact on the community.", "Then, there were successful attempts to make large language models like BERT multilingual by projects like Facebook AI\u2019s XLM mBERT (100+ languages) and CamemBERT which is BERT variant fine-tuned for French:", "So what can we expect from NLP in 2020? This will still be THE field to work in next year.", "Here are the key trends Sudalai Rajkumar (SRK), NLP expert and Kaggle Grandmaster, sees happening in NLP:", "And this is what Sebastian Ruder, co-creator of ULMFiT and an NLP maestro, has to say about NLP in 2020:", "This is an interesting section. Have deep learning and computer vision peaked? Have we hit the ceiling when it comes to making breakthroughs in this space?", "This is a slight concern right now in the deep learning community. This came out during NeurIPS 2019 as well. 2019, in terms of progress in deep learning and computer vision, was all about fine tuning previous approaches.", "But it\u2019s not all concerning news! There were still some amazing open-source deep learning projects that came out this year.", "Remember the DeOldify project that sparked a lot of interest from the deep learning community? Its author, Jason Antic, implemented techniques from a number of papers in the generative modeling field, including self-attention GANs,\u00a0progressively growing GANs\u00a0and a\u00a0two time-scale update rule.", "Let\u2019s see two more powerful computer vision frameworks that came out in 2019!", "Humans can pick out objects in our line of vision in a matter of milliseconds. In fact \u2013 just look around you right now. That is real-time object detection. How cool would be it if we could get machines to do that?", "Now we can! Thanks primarily to the recent surge of breakthroughs in deep learning and computer vision, we can lean on object detection algorithms to not only detect objects in an image \u2013 but to do that with the speed and accuracy of humans.", "Real-time object detection models should be able to sense the environment, parse the scene and finally react accordingly. The model should be able to identify what all types of objects are present in the scene. Once the types of objects have been identified, the model should locate the position of these objects by defining a bounding box around each object.", "There are multiple components or connections in the model. Some of these connections, after a few iterations, become redundant and hence we can remove these connections from the model. Removing these connections is referred to as pruning.", "Pruning will not significantly impact the performance of the model and the computation power will reduce significantly. Hence, in SlimYOLOv3, pruning is performed on convolutional layers. After pruning, we fine-tune the model to compensate for the degradation in the model\u2019s performance.", "A pruned model results in fewer trainable parameters and lower computation requirements in comparison to the original YOLOv3 and hence it is more convenient for real-time object detection.", "SlimYOLOv3 is the modified version of YOLOv3. The convolutional layers of YOLOv3 are pruned to achieve a slim and faster version.", "Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research\u2019s next-generation software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and it originates from the maskrcnn-benchmark.", "Here\u2019s Dat Tran, Head of AI at Axel Springer and a Speaker at DataHack Summit 2019, with his thoughts on what we can expect in deep learning and computer vision in 2020:", "No surprise to see that the focus will remain on GANs next year as well.", "For all those of you who are interested in Reinforcement learning \u2013 here are the star-studded trends in the area of RL in 2020 as stated by \u00a0Xander Steenbrugge.", "Data is driving every business and enterprise in today\u2019s world. Beneath this lies the potential to constructively channelize its direction to achieve harmonious growth.", "On the flip side, there is also a high potential for its direction to become a mode of destruction for masses. It\u2019s all in our hands, so let\u2019s constructively use the power of machine learning for good.", "Ethics is not much talked about in the machine learning realm because people often assume that a computer can\u2019t be biased, prejudiced or harbor stereotypes \u2013 right?", "Not true! The machine learning techniques themselves might be unbiased, but once we feed in the data, assumptions, etc., there\u2019s a high chance of bias appearing in the model. The reason? These are conditions set by us humans, who may project their biases into the results, even if they weren\u2019t intending to do so (unconscious bias).", "Our machine learning community is In the process of realizing the massive potential of this field. And as the saying goes \u2013 Those that work with data have a lot of power; and with that power, comes great responsibility! This sentence is a hard-hitting one.", "There is a dire need for us to set goals to design ethical evidence-based decision-making frameworks. We believe this can only be achieved by understanding the morality, law, and politics of data and artificial intelligence, drawing on world-class research in data science, law, philosophy and beyond.", "One way we can measure ethical practices in machine learning is by using a moral compass. This compass diverges around 4 C\u2019s \u2013 clarity, consistency, control, and consequences. In each of these C\u2019s, if you can put in foreseeable thoughts, the impact of any implementation going in the wrong direction can potentially be stopped. Here is a very interesting solution to how do we can reduce bias in machine learning by Ideo. Check it out!", "Yoshua Bengio, the co-recipient of the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award for his work in deep learning, shares his valuable thoughts on Ethics in machine learning:", "We are sure you must have heard about Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) \u2013 Its the largest conference in AI. A very interesting paper on ethics in AI which I suggest you should read:", "An Overview of AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices", "We\u2019ve covered a lot of trends in this article! From the expected growth areas (such as NLP) to the slight concern around deep learning, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to in 2020.
