The world was harping about it but the cricket associations were looking at it with caution \u2013 the commercial breaks were reduced from 99 seconds to 39 seconds. Ouch! That\u2019s quite a bit of a reduction in revenue.", "But this decision was the most rewarding one in the long run, and now its the highest revenue grossing format in the history of cricket!", "The world will be taken by storm by the Indian Cricket Team at the T-20 World Cup in 2020! Our captain Virat Kohli will once again be in the spotlight for taking critical decisions. Isn\u2019t that a very stressful job? Especially when the hopes of millions of people dwell upon you?", "Wait \u2013 what does all of this have to do with machine learning interpretability, Shapley values, and Game Theory? Here\u2019s a thought to put things into context:", "What if we can build an interesting decision theory to support all the key decisions with utmost accuracy? That would be wonderful, right? It could simply solve all the confusion, like \u2013 the first batsmen to send for batting, the bowler to be chosen, the field placement, etc.", "We can do this with the application of Game Theory! So in this article, we will further explore an alternative method of interpreting Machine Learning models which stems out of the game theory discipline. We will introduce and talk about Shapley Values for machine learning interpretability.", "Well, it is alright if you do not have even basic level exposure to Game Theory. I will cover the basics required and without digressing will focus on a concept called Shapley values and how that can help to interpret machine learning models with an implementation in Python using the SHAP library.", "Let\u2019s define Game Theory first before we get into the crux of this article. This will hold us in good stead as we dive into the way Game Theory is used for interpreting machine learning models.", "Game theory is a theoretical framework for social situations among competing players. It is the science of optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.", "The key pioneers of game theory were mathematicians John von Neumann and John Nash, as well as economist Oskar Morgenstern.", "Now, you might be asking \u2013 what is a game? Is it like chess? Video Games?", "A \u201cGame\u201d is any situation in which there are several decision-makers, and each of them wants to optimize their results. The optimizing decision will depend on the decisions of others. The game identifies the players\u2019 identities, preferences, and available strategies and how these strategies affect the outcome.", "Game Theory attempts to define these situations in mathematical terms and determine what would happen if every player acts rationally.", "In essence, Game Theory is a way to mathematically model complex human behavior, to try to understand it, and predict it. You can read more about game theory and it\u2019s fit in the AI world in this excellent and detailed walkthrough. It\u2019s a fascinating concept!", "Cooperative game theory assumes that groups of players, called coalitions, are the primary units of decision-making, and may enforce cooperative behavior.", "Consequently, cooperative games can be seen as a competition between coalitions of players, rather than between individual players.", "Let\u2019s try to understand cooperative game theory using the concept of Shapley values.", "I love learning any new concept using illustrations and examples so that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll do here.", "Let\u2019s first design a cooperative game. Three friends \u2013 Ram, Abhiraj, and Pranav \u2013 go out for a meal. They order and share fries, wine, and pi. It is hard to figure out who should pay how much since they did not eat an equal share. So, we have the following information:", "So, it turns out the actual amount all 3 of them pay when they eat together is 900. Now, the task at hand is to figure out how much each of them should pay individually.", "The method we will adapt here is:", "We take all permutations of the 3 participants in sequence and see the incremental payout that each of them has to make.", "So here, the sequence is Ram, Abhiraj and then Pranav in turn. As described above, Ram comes and pays 800. Now, Ram and Abhiraj pay 800 only so there is no additional payout for Abhiraj. Hence, we get 0. And finally, all 3 eat together and pay 900 so the additional payout for Pranav is 100.", "We repeat the same exercise for each possible order for the 3 friends and get the following marginal payout values:", "So, what is the Shapley value for Ram, Abhiraj, and Pranav each? It is just the average of the marginal payout for each!", "So now we have reached to the final amount that each of them should pay if all 3 go out together. In the next section, we will see how we can use the concept of Shapley values to interpret machine learning models.", "You have an intuition behind what Shapley values are \u2013 so take a moment to think about how they could help in interpreting a black-box machine learning model.", "We know that each value of an independent variable or a feature for a given sample is a part of a cooperative game where we assume that prediction is actually the payout. So, let us dive into another example to understand this in detail.", "We have trained a machine learning model to predict house prices in Delhi. For a certain house, our model predicts INR 51,00,000 and we need to explain this prediction. The apartment has a size of 50 yards, has a private pool and also a garage:", "The average prediction for all apartments is INR 50,00,000. How much has each feature value contributed to the prediction compared to the average prediction?", "Now, if we talk in terms of Game Theory, the \u201cgame\u201d here is the prediction task for a single instance of the dataset. The \u201cplayers\u201d are the feature values of the instance that collaborate to play the game (predict a value) similar to the meal example where Pranav, Ram, and Abhiraj went for a meal together.", "A possible explanation could be has_pool contributed INR 30,000, garage contributed INR 50,000, and area of 50 yards contributed INR 20,000. The contributions add up to INR 1,00,000 \u2013 the final prediction minus the average predicted house price.", "To summarise, the Shapley value for each variable (payout) is basically trying to find the correct weight such that the sum of all Shapley values is the difference between the predictions and average value of the model. In other words, Shapley values correspond to the contribution of each feature towards pushing the prediction away from the expected value.", "Now that we have understood the underlying intuition for Shapley values and how useful they can be in interpreting machine learning models, let us look at its implementation in Python.", "The SHAP library in Python has inbuilt functions to use Shapley values for interpreting machine learning models. It has optimized functions for interpreting tree-based models and a model agnostic explainer function for interpreting any black-box model for which the predictions are known.", "In the model agnostic explainer, SHAP leverages Shapley values in the below manner. To get the importance of feature X{i}:", "Now, for these subsets, SHAP does not go on and retrain the model for each subset. Instead, for the removed or left out feature, it just replaces it with the average value of the feature and generates the predictions.", "It\u2019s now time to work on a real dataset! As we did in the previous article, we will use the Big Mart Sales problem\u00a0hosted on\u00a0our Datahack Platform.", "The problem statement is about predicting sales for different items being sold at different outlets. You can download the dataset from the above link. We will use Shapley values and also go through some visualizations to look at both local and global interpretations.", "Note: You can go through\u00a0this course to fully understand how to build models using this data. Our focus here is to narrow down on the Shapley value interpretability part.", "You can install the SHAP library using the terminal command:", "Now, let\u2019s begin with building a model for predicting sales. First, we will import the necessary libraries:", "Local Interpretation using SHAP (for prediction at id number 4776)", "In blue, we have negative Shap values that show everything that pushes the sales value in the negative direction. While the Shap value in red represents everything that pushes it towards a positive direction. Note that this is only for observation number 4776.", "Next, let us look at a function that can generate a neat summary for us.", "Now that we can calculate Shap values for each feature of every observation, we can get a global interpretation using Shapley values by looking at it in a combined form. Let\u2019s see how we can do that:", "We get the above plot by putting everything together under one roof. This shows the Shap values on the x-axis. Here, all the values on the left represent the observations that shift the predicted value in the negative direction while the points on the right contribute to shifting the prediction in a positive direction. All the features are on the left y-axis.", "So here, high MRP values are on the right side primarily because they contribute positively to the sales value for each item. Similarly, for outlets with outlet type 0, they have a high impact on pushing the item sales in the negative direction.", "Interpretability remains a very important aspect of machine learning and data science as more complex models are brought into production. LIME and Shapley are two such methods that have started seeing some adoption in the industry.", "With the advent of deep learning, there is more research being done on how to interpret Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision models. The interpretability aspect of computer vision has been covered to some extent", "I hope this was a helpful read for you.
