This eternal question prompts all sorts of different answers from data scientists. Some prefer RStudio, others have a special affinity towards Jupyter Notebooks. I\u2019m definitely in the latter category.", "So, when I first came across TensorFlow.js (previously deeplearn.js), my mind was blown. Building a machine learning model in my browser? And using JavaScript? Sounded too good to be true!", "More than 4.3 billion people use a web browser \u2013 around 55% of the world\u2019s population. \u2013 Wikipedia (March 2019)", "Not only has Google\u2019s TensorFlow.js democratized machine learning for the masses by bringing it to the browser, But it is also the perfect gateway to machine learning for developers who work regularly with JavaScript.", "Our web browsers are one of the most easily accessible platforms. And that\u2019s why it makes sense to be able to build applications that are able to not only train machine learning models but are also able to \u201clearn\u201d or \u201ctransfer learn\u201d in the browser itself.", "In this article, we\u2019ll first understand the importance of using TensorFlow.js and it\u2019s different components.

I won\u2019t delve into the theoretical aspect of TensorFlow.js and list down pointers on why it\u2019s such an incredible tool.", "Instead, I will simply show you what you will miss out on if you do not use TensorFlow.js. So, let\u2019s build an application to classify images using your webcam in under 5 minutes. That\u2019s right \u2013 we will jump right into the code!", "And here\u2019s the best part \u2013 you do not need to install anything to do this! Just a text editor and a web browser is enough. The below video shows the application we\u2019ll be building:", "How cool is that? I literally built that in a matter of minutes in my browser.

We\u2019ll discuss transfer learning and deploying our model in Python in the second part of this series (coming soon!).", "TensorFlow.js provides two ways to train models (quite similar to what TensorFlow does):", "Let\u2019s understand both the approaches through the lens of a few examples. After all, the best way to learn a concept is by putting it into practice!", "First, set up your HTML file:", "Create a new\u00a0index.html\u00a0file in your computer and write the following code in it:", "We have created a basic HTML page and loaded Tensorflow.js (line 7) from a cloud URL.", "A note about installing TensorFlow.js (deeplearn.js)", "Since TensorFlow.js is made for the browser, the easiest method to install and use TensorFlow.js is to not install it at all. You can simply load it from a URL in your HTML.", "What if you want to work locally? Well, you can actually use TensorFlow.js inside Jupyter Notebook like you normally do in case of Python or R. There\u2019s a solution in this for everyone!", "This local approach is slightly longer and takes time so we won\u2019t be using it in this article. If you do want to learn how to do it, you can start by installing ijavascript kernel for Jupyter. Here is a screenshot of how it looks in my Jupyter notebook:", "Now, the recommended approach to use TensorFlow.js is to load it directly by using the official URL of the library. You just have to add the following line to your HTML file:", "And done! It really is that straightforward.", "The Core API is very similar to the TensorFlow Core where we can define models using low-level tensor operations and linear algebra.", "This is very useful if we want to build custom models or want to build neural networks from scratch. Let\u2019s take up an example of working with tensors in the browser.", "Start by adding the below code between the <script></script>\u00a0tags in your index.html file:", "The\u00a0<script> tags basically denote JavaScript.

This should work on both Chrome and Firefox. We get the output of the above operations in the console:", "If you want to read more about Core API in depth, then I recommend going through the official CoreAPI documentation.", "The Layers API is very similar to Keras in Python. Just like Keras, you can create a model using both sequential\u00a0and\u00a0functional\u00a0approaches.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the sequential approach through an example. We will train a regression model on these data points:", "Here, X and Y have a linear relationship \u2013 each Y is corresponding to X + i (where i is 0, 1, 2, 3\u2026n+1). Let\u2019s train a basic regression model on this dataset. You can write the following code between the <script></script>\u00a0tags in your index.html file:", "The keen-eyed among you must have noticed how the above syntax is very similar to the Keras syntax for building a sequential model in Python. We\u2019ll get the prediction when we go back to our browser console.", "Our simple regression model predicts\u00a07.556, which is very close to the expected value of\u00a08. This was a basic example but we can clearly see how easy and useful it is to build machine learning models straight in our browser itself.", "TensorFlow.js is capable of building both machine learning and deep learning models in the browser. It also automatically takes advantage of the power of GPU(s), if available in your system during model training.", "Here are a few examples of deep learning models trained using TensorFlow.js on some standard datasets:", "You can explore these examples in the tfjs-examples repository.", "TensorFlow.js provides tons of pretrained models from Google for many useful tasks like object detection, voice recognition, image segmentation etc. The advantage of pre-trained models is that we can use them without any major dependencies or installation and right out of the box.", "Google is widely expected to add even more models in the coming months. You can take a look at the available pre-trained models here:", "Tensorflow.js comes with a lot of pre-trained models from Google", "We will work with\u00a0PoseNet in this article. PoseNet is a vision model that can be used to estimate the pose of a person in an image or video by estimating where key body joints are located.", "This is a fascinating concept. Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos. This helps us determine, for example, where someone\u2019s elbow shows up in an image.", "Just to be clear \u2013 pose estimation is not about recognizing who is in an image. The algorithm is simply estimating where key body joints are located.", "The key points detected are indexed by \u201cPart\u201d and \u201cID\u201d, with a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 being the highest.", "Here is an example of the kind of output PoseNet gives:", "Incredible, right?! We will be using the ml5.js library in order to work with PoseNet. ml5.js is a library built on top of TensorFlow.js along with p5.js, another library that makes it easier to access the webcam in the browser.", "ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser with a simple syntax, building on top of TensorFlow.js.", "For example, you can create an image classification model with MobileNet using ml5.js in under 5 lines of code like this:", "It\u2019s this simplicity of Ml5.js that makes it so good for quick prototyping in the browser and that is why we are also using it for our project.", "Let\u2019s get back to PoseNet. Create a new file index.html and add the below code:", "This will create a basic HTML web page and load the necessary files:", "Now, we will write JavaScript code for working with PoseNet.

Here are the steps needed to make this work:", "Step 1:\u00a0Load the PoseNet model and capture video from your webcam", "We will load PoseNet using ml5.js. At the same time, p5.js enables us to capture video from webcam using just a few lines of code:", "The most important things to note in the above code block are:", "Step 2: Detect key points in body joints", "The next step is to detect the poses. You might have noticed in the previous step that we are saving every detected pose in the poses\u00a0variable by calling poseNet.on(). This function runs in the background continuously. Whenever a new pose is found, it gives the location of body joints in the following format:", "We do not have to write code for this part since it is automatically generated.", "Step 3:\u00a0Display the detected body joints", "We know the detected body joints and their x and y location. Now, we just need to draw them over the video to display the detected body joints. We\u2019ve seen that PoseNet gives us a list of body joints detected with a confidence score for each joint and its x and y locations.", "We will use a threshold value of 20% (keypoint.score > 0.2) confidence score in order to draw a key point. Here is the code to do this:", "Step 4: Draw the estimated skeleton of the body", "Along with the key points or body joints, PoseNet also detects the estimated skeleton of the body. We can use the poses\u00a0variable to draw the skeleton:", "Here, we looped over the detected skeleton and created lines joining the key points. The code is fairly straightforward again.", "Now, the last step is to call the drawSkeleton()\u00a0and\u00a0drawKeypoints()\u00a0functions repeatedly along with the video feed that we are capturing from the webcam. We can do that using the draw()\u00a0function of p5.js which is called directly after\u00a0setup()\u00a0and executes repeatedly:", "Next, go to your terminal window, into your project folder, and start a Python server:", "Then go to your browser and open the following address:", "Voila! Your PoseNet should be nicely detecting your body pose (if you have followed all the steps correctly). Here is how my model looks:", "You can see why I love TensorFlow.js. It is incredibly effective and doesn\u2019t even require you to worry about complex installation steps while building your models.", "TensorFlow.js shows a lot of promise for making machine learning more accessible by bringing it to the browser. And at the same time, it has advantages like data privacy, interactivity etc. This combination makes it a very powerful tool to keep in a data scientist\u2019s toolbox, especially if you want to deploy your machine learning applications.", "In the next article, we will explore how to apply transfer learning in the browser and deploy your machine learning or deep learning models using TensorFlow.js.", "The project that we did with PoseNet can be taken even further to build a pose recognition application by just training another classifier over it.
