One such conference, which I am an avid follower of, is the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).", "Folks from top machine learning research companies, like Google AI, Facebook, Uber, etc. come together and present their latest research. It\u2019s a conference any data scientist would not want to miss.", "ICML 2019, held last week in Southern California, USA, saw records tumble in astounding fashion. The number of papers received and the number of papers accepted at the conference \u2013 both broke all previous records. Check out the numbers:", "A panel of hand-picked judges is charged with picking out the best papers from this list. Receiving this best paper award is quite a prestigious achievement \u2013 everyone in the research community strives for it!", "And decrypting these best papers from ICML 2019 has been an eye-opener for me. I love going through these papers and breaking them down so our community can also partake in the hottest happenings in machine learning.", "In this article, we\u2019ll look at Google AI\u2019s best paper from the ICML 2019 conference. There is a heavy focus on unsupervised learning so there\u2019s a lot to unpack. Let\u2019s dive right in.", "You can also check out my articles on the best papers from ICLR 2019 here.", "Our main focus is on the first paper from the Google AI team. So let\u2019s check out what Google has put forward for our community.", "Note: There are certain unsupervised deep learning concepts you should be aware of before diving into this article. I suggest going through the below guides first in case you need a quick refresher:", "Let\u2019s first understand what disentangled representations are. Here is Google AI\u2019s succinct and simple definition of the concept:", "The ability to understand high-dimensional data, and to distill that knowledge into useful representations in an unsupervised manner, remains a key challenge in deep learning. One approach to solving these challenges is through disentangled representations, models that capture the independent features of a given scene in such a way that if one feature changes, the others remain unaffected. \u2013 Google AI", "As the paper says, in representation learning, it is often assumed that real-world observations x, like images or videos, are generated by a two-step generative process:", "In other words, a lower dimensional entity, which is mapped to the higher-dimensional space of observation, could be used to explain a high-dimension observation.", "The objective of this research is to point out the areas of improvement for future work to make unsupervised disentangled methods better.", "The authors have released a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different datasets, including 12,000 models that were trained covering the most prominent methods and evaluation metrics.", "There is currently no single formalized notion of disentanglement which is widely accepted. So, the key intuition is that a disentangled representation should separate the distinct, informative factors of variations in the data.", "The current state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised disentanglement learning are largely based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). A specific distribution P(z) is assumed on a latent space and then a deep neural network is used to parameterize the conditional probability P(x|z).", "Similarly, the distribution P(z|x) is approximated using a variational distribution Q(z|x). The model is then trained by minimizing a suitable approximation to the negative log-likelihood.", "Google AI researchers have challenged the commonly held assumptions in this field.
