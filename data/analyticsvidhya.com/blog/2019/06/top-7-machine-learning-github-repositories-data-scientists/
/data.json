Microsoft put it best when they explained why interpretability is essential:", "Interpreting the inner working of a machine learning model becomes tougher as the complexity increases. Have you ever tried to take apart and understand a multiple model ensemble? It takes a lot of time and effort to do it.", "We can\u2019t simply go to our client or leadership with a complex model without being able to explain how it produced a good score/accuracy. That\u2019s a one-way ticket back to the drawing board for us.", "The folks at Microsoft Research have developed the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) algorithm to help with interpretability. This EBM technique has both high accuracy and intelligibility \u2013 the holy grail.", "Interpret ML isn\u2019t limited to just using EBM.

The problem with 3D shapes is that they are inherently irregular. This makes operations like convolutions difficult an challenging.", "This is where MeshCNN comes into play. From the repository:", "Meshes are a list of vertices, edges and faces, which together define the shape of the 3D object. The problem is that every vertex has a different # of neighbors, and there is no order.", "If you\u2019re a fan of computer vision and are keen to learn or apply CNNs, this is the perfect repository for you. You can learn more about CNNs through our articles:", "Decision Tree algorithms are among the first advanced techniques we learn in machine learning. Honestly, I truly appreciate this technique after logistic regression. I could use it on bigger datasets, understand how it worked, how the splits happened, etc.", "I personally love this repository. It is a treasure trove for data scientists. The repository contains a collection of papers on tree based algorithms, including decision, regression and classification trees.
