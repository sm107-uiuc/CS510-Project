Can you open up the black-box model and explain how it arrived at the final result?", "These are critical questions we need to answer as data scientists. A wide variety of businesses are relying on machine learning to drive their strategy and spruce up their bottomline. Building a model that we can explain to our clients and stakeholders is key.", "Can you imagine building a facial recognition software that misclassifies a person? Or a credit card fraud detection model that raises an alarm for a perfectly legal transaction? And then not being able to explain why that\u2019s happening \u2013 not ideal.", "So the question is \u2013 how do we build interpretable machine learning models? That\u2019s what we will talk about in this article. We\u2019ll first understand what interpretable machine learning is and why it\u2019s important.

The need to trust these AI-based systems is paramount.", "So, let\u2019s first take a step back and ask the question: What involves a predictive modeling lifecycle?", "All these steps are involved in almost all problems based on structured datasets. However, a key issue that arises especially as model complexity increases is interpretability. Let\u2019s start with the formal definition:", "Interpretation of a machine learning model is the process wherein we try to understand the predictions of a machine learning model.", "The involvement of humans in a predictive modeling lifecycle is at two important stages:", "Before we jump into various kinds of techniques for interpreting machine learning models, let\u2019s look at why this is important.", "Let\u2019s take a simple example to understand this. Suppose we are trying to predict employees\u2019 performance in a big company to expedite the appraisal process and identify the best employees.", "We have data from the last 10 years about the performance reviews of employees. But what if that company tends to promote more men than women?", "In this case, the model might learn the bias and predict that men tend to perform at a higher scale (and this bias has unfortunately happened in certain real-world scenarios). Now, if there is no way to interpret our model at this stage, the model might end up providing false insights at the cost of compromising on fairness.", "Let\u2019s consider another example. Consider that we are building a model for classifying wolves vs dogs. The data that is available is simply labeled images of dogs and wolves.", "Now, what if we have wolves and dogs in entirely different backgrounds? This is entirely possible as wolves are mostly found in the wild (in snow, jungles, etc.) while dogs are in completely different backgrounds (households) generally.", "We built an image classifier and got a really good performance on the validation set.", "But on using one of the interpretability methods, we see that our model is actually ignoring the dog and wolf while using just the background pixels for doing the classification. This model might give a good performance on the validation set as they contain different backgrounds for the wolf and dog respectively.", "Having an interpretable model, in this case, enables us to test the causality of the features, test its reliability and ultimately can help us to debug the model appropriately.", "For example, we can try to alter our data by adding images of the animals in different backgrounds or simply crop the background out of the images to ensure that the right signal is picked up by our machine learning or deep learning model.", "Based on the latest regulations by the EU, GDPR\u2019s article 12 allows individuals to enquire about algorithmic decisions. For example, in the banking and finance industry, questions such as the following can come up and have to be answered by these banks:", "Not everything requires interpretability. It is also important to understand when we do not need to invest in building interpretable machine learning models.", "Now that we have an intuition of what ML interpretability is and why it\u2019s important, let\u2019s look at the different ways to classify interpretability techniques:", "Overall we can think of interpretability under two structures:", " Whether we are looking to interpret globally for all data points, the importance of each variable, or are we looking to explain a particular prediction which is local?", "The second way of looking at this is whether we are talking about a technique that works across all types of models (model agnostic) or is tailor-made for a particular class of algorithms (model specific).", "For linear models such as a linear and logistic regression, we can get the importance from the weights/coefficients of each feature.", "Let\u2019s revisit that quickly. Suppose we are trying to predict an employee\u2019s salary using linear regression. The independent variables are experience in years and a previous rating out of 5.\u00a0", "For normalized data, W1 and W2 can essentially tell us whether the experience is more important towards salary or rating. Here, note that this is a model-specific technique that can be used for both global and local explanations.", "Learn more about linear and logistic regression in the below articles:", "A decision tree is another algorithm that is very interpretable as we have access to all the splits for each feature:", "We can clearly see how the decisions are being taken starting from the root node to the leaf node. We just have to follow the rules on the basis of independent variables and list them down to explain each prediction. Again, this is a model-specific technique that can be used for local explanations.", "For a small decision tree, we can use the above diagram. However, if we have a lot of features and we are training a deep decision tree for, let\u2019s say, a depth of 8 or 9, there will be too many decision rules to present effectively. In this case, we can use feature importance to interpret the importance of each feature at a global level.", "Now, let\u2019s learn how we can calculate feature importance for a decision tree.", "Decision trees make splits to maximize the decrease in impurity. We can use this reduction to measure the contribution of each feature.", "Here, again, this is a model-specific technique that can be used for only global explanations. This is because we are looking at the overall importance and not at each prediction.", "Learn more about decision trees in this superb tutorial.", "Now, let us try to understand this with an example. This will help you visualize what we\u2019ve covered so far (and understand its importance).", "Let\u2019s say we have a decision tree with 4 samples and Gini impurity values as shown in the below figure. Each feature here appears only once so we can directly use the formula to calculate feature importance:", "Since each feature is used once in our case, there is no need to calculate the sum.", "Take a moment to pause here and calculate this on your own. You will have a much better grasp on the concept once you do it by yourself.", "Now, for tree ensembles such as random forest and Gradient Boosting Machines, we can use the same feature importance. But this time, we will take its average across all trees. Let us look at the steps involved:", "The popular sklearn library uses this technique to find feature importance for each feature.", "Here are two intuitive guides to learn about Random Forest and Ensembling:", "So far, we have discussed model-specific techniques for linear and logistic regression, as well as decision trees. We also spoke about the feature importance methods that are used for ensemble methods. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering \u2013 what about other models?", "Now, we know that some models are hard to interpret, such as random forest and gradient boosting.", "We did use feature importance for these techniques. But it does not tell us whether a particular feature affects the target positively or negatively. And that is VERY important in certain cases.", "Some machine learning models are even harder to interpret. For example, a deep neural network model can have millions of learned parameters and it essentially ends up being an extreme version of a black-box model.", "I really like this plot. As the complexity of the machine learning model increases, we get better performance but lose out on interpretability. You should keep this figure handy the next time you\u2019re building your own model.", "So how can we build interpretable machine learning models that don\u2019t compromise on accuracy?", "One idea is to use simpler models. That way you can ensure you have full confidence in the interpretability.\u00a0 However, complex models can provide much better performance. So is there a way we can have some level of interpretability for black-box models as well?", "Yes! Model agnostic techniques allow us to build and use more complex models without losing all interpretability power.", "Let\u2019s take a high-level look at model-agnostic interpretability. We capture the world by collecting data, and abstract it further by learning to predict the data with a machine learning model. Interpretability is just another layer on top that helps humans understand the black box using a simpler, more interpretable model.", "The first model agnostic method we will discuss here is the global surrogate method. A global surrogate model is an interpretable model that is trained to approximate the predictions of a black-box model.", "We can draw conclusions about the black-box model by interpreting the surrogate model. So, we are basically solving machine learning interpretability by using more machine learning!", "For example, we could interpret a random forest classifier using a simple decision tree to explain its predictions:", "This is done by training a decision tree on the predictions of the black-box model (which is a random forest in our case). And once it provides good enough accuracy, we can use it to explain the random forest classifier.", "Overall, we want an interpretable surrogate model that is trained to approximate the predictions of a black-box model and draw conclusions.", "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to understand how a global surrogate model works:", "The global surrogate method is good for looking at an interpretable model that can explain predictions for a black-box approach. However, this will not work well if we want to understand how a single prediction was made for a given observation.", "This is where we use the LIME technique which stands for local interpretable model agnostic explanations. LIME is based on the work presented in this paper. Let us understand how LIME works using an example.", "Suppose we are working on a binary classification problem. As we can see in the above image, we have a decision boundary for a black-box model with two features.", "Let\u2019s say we want to interpret the contributions of x1 and x2 for the observation in yellow (in the below image). We take the data sampled from a normal distribution to generate fake data around the observation:", "Next, we assign higher weights to the points that are closer to our observation:", "We train an interpretable model over the fake data generated from the distribution. Now, we have a new local decision boundary for the locally learned model (in white) that can be used to understand the contributions of x1 and x2 towards the prediction of our observation:", "My favorite part of the article \u2013 building interpretable machine learning models in Python!", "Here, we will work on the implementation of both the methods we covered above. We will use the big mart sales problem hosted on our Datahack Platform. The problem statement includes predicting sales for different items being sold at different outlets. You can download the dataset from the above link.", "Note: You can go through this course to fully understand how to build models using this data. Our focus here is to focus on the interpretability part.", "Let us first look at how to do interpretability for inherently interpretable machine learning models.", "Use the Graphviz library to visualize the decision tree", "This visualization of our decision tree clearly displays the rules it is using to make a prediction. Here, Item_MRP & Outlet_Type are the first features that are affecting the sales of various items at each outlet. If you want to look at the complete decision tree, you can easily do that by changing the max_depth parameter using the export_graphviz function.", "Now, we will have a look at the feature importance for each feature in case of a random forest.", "The random forest model gives a similar interpretation. Item_MRP still remains the most important feature (exactly as the decision tree model above). Relative importance also helps us compare each feature. For example, Outlet_Type_0 is a much more important feature than other outlet types.", "As an exercise try calculating the feature importance for the decision tree we fit earlier and compare:", "Next, we will create a surrogate decision tree model for this random forest model and see what we get.", "This decision tree performs well on the new target and can be used as a surrogate model to explain the predictions of a random forest model. Similarly, we can use it for any other complex model. Just make sure your decision tree fits well, otherwise, you might get wrong interpretations (a nightmare!).", "We can implement the LIME technique in both R & Python using the LIME package. \u00a0Let\u2019s jump into implementation for the same to check the local interpretation of a given prediction using LIME:", "\nThe predicted value for sales is 185.40. Each feature\u2019s contribution to this prediction is shown in the right bar plot. Orange signifies the positive impact and blue signifies the negative impact of that feature on the target. For example, Item_MRP has a positive impact on sales.", "Using the coding window below, try applying LIME to more complex models such as Xgboost & LightGBM. The code for preprocessing and model building is already inserted here:", "For more details on LIME and its implementation, you can go through this article.", "LIME is a powerful technique but has its disadvantages as it relies on locally generated fake data and uses simple linear models to explain predictions.
