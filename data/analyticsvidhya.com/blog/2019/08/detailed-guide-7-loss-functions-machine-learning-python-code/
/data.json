Yes \u2013 and that, in a nutshell, is where loss functions come into play in machine learning.", "In this article, I will discuss 7 common loss functions used in machine learning and explain where each of them is used.\u00a0We have much to cover in this article, so let\u2019s begin!", "Loss functions are one part of the entire machine-learning journey you will take. Here\u2019s the perfect course to help you get started and make you industry-ready:", "Loss functions are at the heart of the machine learning algorithms we love to use. But I\u2019ve seen the majority of beginners and enthusiasts in deep learning and machine learning becoming quite confused regarding how and where to use them. They\u2019re not difficult to understand and will enhance your understanding of machine learning algorithms infinitely. So, what are loss functions, and how can you grasp their meaning?", "Let\u2019s say you are on the top of a hill and need to climb down.

This is exactly what a loss function provides.", "A loss function maps decisions to their associated costs.", "Deciding to go up the slope will cost us energy and time. Deciding to go down will benefit us. Therefore, it has a negative cost.", "In supervised machine learning algorithms, we want to minimize the error for each training example during the learning process, i.e., we want the loss value obtained from the loss function to be as low as possible. This is done using some optimization strategies like gradient descent. And this error comes from the loss function.", "I want to emphasize this: although cost function and loss function are synonymous and used interchangeably, they are different.", "A loss function is for a single training example. It is also sometimes called an error function. A cost function, on the other hand, is the average loss over the entire training dataset. The optimization strategies aim at minimizing the cost function.", "You must be quite familiar with linear regression at this point. It deals with modeling a linear relationship between a dependent variable, Y, and several independent variables, X_i\u2019s.

Since there are no local minima, we will never get stuck in one. Hence, it is always guaranteed that Gradient Descent will converge (if it converges at all) to the global minimum.", "The MSE loss function penalizes the model for making large errors by squaring them. Squaring a large quantity makes it even larger, right? But there\u2019s a caveat. This property makes the MSE cost function less robust to outliers. Therefore, it should not be used if our data is prone to many outliers.", "Absolute Error for each training example is the distance between the predicted and the actual values, irrespective of the sign, i.e., it is the absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. Absolute Error is also known as the L1 loss:", "As I mentioned before, the cost is the Mean of these Absolute Errors, which is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).", "The MAE cost is more robust to outliers as compared to MSE. However, handling the absolute or modulus operator in mathematical equations is not easy. I\u2019m sure a lot of you must agree with this! We can consider this as a disadvantage of MAE.", "Here is the code for the update_weight function with MAE cost:", "We get the below plot after running the code for 500 iterations with different learning rates:", "The Huber loss combines the best properties of MSE and MAE. It is quadratic for smaller errors and is linear otherwise (and similarly for its gradient).

It is used in Robust Regression, M-estimation, and Additive Modelling. A variant of Huber Loss is also used in classification.", "The name is pretty self-explanatory. Binary Classification refers to assigning an object to one of two classes. This classification is based on a rule applied to the input feature vector. These loss functions are used with classification problems. For example, classifying an email as spam or not spam based on, say, its subject line is a binary classification.", "I will illustrate these binary classification loss functions on the Breast Cancer dataset.", "We want to classify a tumor as \u2018Malignant\u2019 or \u2018Benign\u2019 based on features like average radius, area, perimeter, etc. For simplification, we will use only two input features (X_1 and X_2), namely \u2018worst area\u2019 and \u2018mean symmetry,\u2019 for classification.
