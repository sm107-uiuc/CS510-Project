One thing has stood out \u2013 aspiring machine learning professionals don\u2019t focus enough on projects that will make them stand out.", "And no, I don\u2019t mean online competitions and hackathons (though that is always a plus point to showcase). I\u2019m talking about off-the-cuff experiments you should do using libraries and frameworks that have just been released. This shows the interviewer two broad things:", "And guess which platform has the latest machine learning developments and code? That\u2019s right \u2013 GitHub!", "So let\u2019s look at the top seven machine learning GitHub projects that were released last month. These projects span the length and breadth of machine learning, including projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Big Data and more.", "This is part of our monthly Machine Learning GitHub series we have been running since January 2018. Here are the links for this year so you can catch up quickly:\n", "I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) blows my mind. I started working in data science a few years back and the sheer scale at which NLP has grown and transformed the way we work with text \u2013 it almost defies description.", "PyTorch-Transformers is the latest in a long line of state-of-the-art NLP libraries. It has beaten all previous benchmarks in various NLP tasks. What I really like about PyTorch Transformers is that is contains PyTorch implementations, pretrained models weights and other important components to get you started quickly.", "You might have been frustrated previously at the ridiculous amount of computation power required to run state-of-the-art models. I know I was (not everyone has Google\u2019s resources!). PyTorch-Transformers eradicates the issue to a large degree and enables folks like us to build state-of-the-art NLP models.", "Here are a few in-depth articles to get you started with PyTorch-Transformers (and the concept of pre-trained models in NLP):", "Multi-label classification on text data is quite a challenge in the real world. We typically work on single label tasks when we\u2019re dealing with early stage NLP problems. The level goes up several notches on real-world data.", "In a multi-label classification problem, an instance/record can have multiple labels and the number of labels per instance is not fixed.", "NeuralClassifier enables us to quickly implement neural models for hierarchical multi-label classification tasks. What I personally like about NeuralClassifier is that it provides a wide variety of text encoders we are familiar with, such as FastText, RCNN, Transformer encoder and so on.", "We can perform the below classification tasks using NeuralClassifier:", "Here are two excellent articles to read up on what exactly multi-label classification is and how to perform it in Python:", "This TDEngine repository received the most stars of any new project on GitHub last month. Close to 10,000 stars in less than a month. Let that sink in for a second.", "TDEngine is an open-source Big Data platform designed for:", "TDEngine essentially provides a whole suit of tasks that we associate with data engineering. And we get to do all this at super quick speed (10x speed on processing queries and 1/5th computational usage).", "There\u2019s a caveat (for now) \u2013 TDEngine only supports execution on Linux. This GitHub repository includes the full documentation and starter\u2019s guide with code.", "I suggest checking out our comprehensive resource guide for data engineers:", "Have you worked with any image data yet? Computer Vision techniques for manipulating and dealing with images are quite advanced. Object detection for images is considered a basic step to becoming a computer vision expert.", "What about videos, though? The difficult level goes up several notches when we\u2019re asked to simply draw bounding boxes around objects in videos. The dynamic aspect of objects makes the entire concept more complex.", "So, imagine my delight when I came across this GitHub repository. We just need to draw a bounding box around the object in the video to remove it. It really is that easy! Here are a couple of examples of how this project works:", "If you\u2019re new to the world of computer vision, here are a few resources to get you up and running:", "You\u2019ll love this machine learning GitHub project. As data scientists, our entire role revolves around experimenting with algorithms (well, most of us). This project is about how a simple LSTM model can autocomplete Python code.", "The code highlighted in grey below is what the LSTM model filled in (and the results are at the bottom of the image):", "We train and predict on after cleaning comments, strings and blank lines in the python code. The model is trained after tokenizing python code. It seems more efficient than character level prediction with byte-pair encoding.", "If you\u2019ve ever spent (wasted) time on writing out mundane Python lines, this might be exactly what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s still in the very early stages so be open to a few issues.", "And if you\u2019re wondering what in the world LSTM is, you should read this introductory article:", "TensorFlow and PyTorch both have strong user communities. But the incredible adoption rate of PyTorch should see it leapfrog TensorFlow in the next year or two. Note: This isn\u2019t a knock on TensorFlow which is pretty solid.", "So if you have written any code in TensorFlow and a separate one in PyTorch and want to combine the two to train a model \u2013 the tfpyth framework is for you. The best part about tfpyth is that we don\u2019t need to rewrite the earlier code.", "This GitHub repository includes a well structured example of how you can use tfpyth. It\u2019s definitely a refreshing look at the TensorFlow vs. PyTorch debate, isn\u2019t it?", "Here are a couple of in-depth articles to learn how TensorFlow and PyTorch work:", "I associate transfer learning with NLP. That\u2019s my fault \u2013 I am so absorbed with the new developments that I did not imagine where else transfer learning could be applied. So I was thrilled when I came across this wonderful MedicalNet project.", "This GitHub repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the \u2018Med3D: Transfer Learning for 3D Medical Image Analysis\u2018 paper. This machine learning project aggregates the medical dataset with diverse modalities, target organs, and pathologies to build relatively large datasets.", "And as we well know, our deep learning models do (usually) require a large amount of training data. So MedicalNet, released by TenCent, is a brilliant open source project I hope a lot of folks work on.", "The developers behind MedicalNet have released four pretrained models based on 23 datasets. And here is an intuitive introduction to transfer learning if you needed one:", "Quite a mix of machine learning projects we have here. I have provided tutorials, guides and resources after each GitHub project.", "I have one ask \u2013 pick the project that interests you, go through the tutorial, and then apply that particular library to solve the problem. For example, you could take up the NeuralClassifier repository and use that to solve a multi-label classification problem.", "This will help you broaden your understanding of the topic and expand your current skillset.
