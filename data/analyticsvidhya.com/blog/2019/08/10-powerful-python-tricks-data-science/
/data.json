As data scientists, we are accustomed to working with familiar libraries and calling the same functions every time. It\u2019s time to break the old routine!", "Python isn\u2019t just limited to Pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn (though they are absolutely essential in data\u00a0science)! There is a whole world of Python tricks we can use to improve our code, speed up our data science tasks, and become much more efficient in writing code.", "And more importantly \u2013 learning new things we can do in Python is simply a whole lot of fun! I love playing around with different packages and functions. And every once in a while, a new trick will catch my eye and I incorporate that into my daily routine.", "So I decided to collate my favorite Python tricks in one place \u2013 this article! This list ranges from speeding up basic data science tasks like pre-processing to getting R and Python code in the same Jupyter Notebook. There\u2019s a whole lot of learning waiting for us so let\u2019s dive right in!", "New to Python and the world of Data Science? Here is a superb and utterly comprehensive course to get you started with both:", "Quite often we end up writing complex for loops to combine more than one list together. Sounds familiar? Then you\u2019ll love the zip function. The purpose of this zip function is to \u201cmake an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables\u201d.", "Let\u2019s see how to use the zip function via a simple example and combine multiple lists:", "That\u2019s it! See how easy it is to combine multiple lists?", "I love working with Google Maps data. Think about it \u2013 it is one of the most data-rich applications you\u2019ll find anywhere. That\u2019s why I decided to start off with this Python trick.", "Scatterplots are excellent when we want to see the relationship between two variables. But will you use them if the variables are the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location? Probably not. It would be best to plot these points on a real map so that we can easily visualize and solve a particular problem (such as optimizing routes).", "gmplot provides an amazing interface to generate HTML and JavaScript to render all the data we\u2019d like on top of Google Maps. Let\u2019s see how to use gmplot with an example.", "You can download the dataset for this code here. Right, let\u2019s import the libraries and read the data:", "The above code will generate the HTML file and you can see that latitude and longitude coordinates are plotted on Google Maps. The heatmap shows the areas with a high density of points in red color. Pretty cool, right?", "One of the biggest obstacles we face in early-stage data science datasets \u2013 what in the world should we do about categorical variables? Our machines crunch numbers in the blink of an eye but dealing with categories is a whole different problem.", "A few Machine Learning algorithms can handle categorical variables on their own. But we are required to convert them into numerical variables and for this, category_encoders is an amazing library that provides 15 different encoding schemes.", "Let\u2019s see how can we make use of this library.", "category_encoders supports around 15 different encoding methods, such as:", "All the encoders are fully compatible with sklearn-transformers so they can easily be used in your existing scripts. Also, category_encoders supports NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes. You can read more about category_encoders here.", "How much time do you typically spend on cleaning and pre-processing your data? The saying that a data scientist typically spends 60-70% of his/her time just cleaning the data is quite true. And it\u2019s important for us to track this, right?", "We don\u2019t want to spend days and days cleaning the data and neglecting the other data science steps. This is where the progress_apply\u00a0function makes our life so much easier. Let me demonstrate how it works.", "Let\u2019s calculate the distance of all the points from a particular point and see the progress of completion of this task. You can download the dataset for this here.", "https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/final_5d4d759b1e00260014541fc6_53299.mp4\nYou can see how easy is to track the progress of our code. Simple, efficient and a lifesaver.\n\u00a0\n5. pandas_profiling: Generate a Detailed Report of your Dataset\nWe spend a LOT of our time in understanding the data we\u2019ve been given. And that\u2019s fair \u2013 we don\u2019t want to jump straight to model building without understanding what we\u2019re working with. This is an essential step in any data science project.\npandas_profiling is a Python package that reduces a lot of effort in doing the initial data analysis steps. This package generates a detailed report of our data in just one line of code!\nView the code on Gist.\n\u00a0\nhttps://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pandas-profiling_demo1.mp4\nWe can see that with just one line of code, we got a detailed report of the dataset:\n\nWarnings like: Item_Identifier has a high cardinality: 1559 distinct values Warning\nFrequency Count of all categorical variables\nQuantile and Descriptive statistics of numerical variables\nCorrelation Plot\n\n\u00a0\n6. grouper: Grouping Time Series Data\nWho isn\u2019t familiar with Pandas at this point? It is one of the most popular Python libraries around and is widely used for data manipulation and analysis. We know that Pandas has amazing capabilities to manipulate and summarize the data.\nI was recently working on a time series problem and noticed that Pandas had a Grouper function that I had never used before. I became really curious about its use (the data scientist curse!).\nAs it turns out, this Grouper function is quite an important function for time series data analysis. So, let\u2019s try this out and see how it works. You can download the dataset for this code here.\nView the code on Gist.\n\nNow, the first step to deal with any time series data is to convert the date column into a DateTime format:\nView the code on Gist.\n\u00a0\nSuppose our objective is to see the monthly sales for each customer. Most of us try to write something complex here. But this is where Pandas has something more useful for us (got to love Pandas!).\nView the code on Gist.\n\nInstead of having to play around with reindexing, we can use a simple approach via the groupby syntax. We\u2019ll add something extra to this function by providing a little more information on how to group the data in the date column. It looks cleaner and works in exactly the same way:\nView the code on Gist.\n\n\u00a0\n7. unstack: Transform the Index into Columns of your Dataframe\nWe just saw how grouper can be helpful in grouping time series data. Now, here\u2019s a challenge \u2013 what if we want to see the name column (which is the index in the above example) as the column of our dataframe.\nThis is where the unstack function becomes vital. Let\u2019s apply the unstack function on the above code sample and see the results.\nView the code on Gist.\n\u00a0\n\nQuite useful! Note: If the index is not a MultiIndex, the output will be a Series.\n\u00a0\n8. %matplotlib Notebook: Interactive Plots in your Jupyter Notebook\nI\u2019m a big fan of the matplotlib library. It is the most common visualization library that we use to generate all kinds of plots in our Jupyter Notebooks.\nTo view these plots, we generally use one line \u2013 %matplotlib inline \u2013 while importing the matplotlib library. This works well but it renders the static plots within the Jupyter Notebook.\nJust replace the line %matplotlib inline with %matplotlib notebook and watch the magic unfold. You will get resizable and zoomable plots within your notebook!\nView the code on Gist.\n\u00a0\nhttps://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/matplotlib-final.mp4\nBrilliant! With just one word change, we can get interactive plots that allow us to resize and zoom within the plots.\n\u00a0\n9. %%time: Check the Running Time of a Particular Block of Python Code\nThere can be multiple approaches to solve one problem. We know this pretty well as data scientists. Computational costs matter in the industry \u2013 especially if it\u2019s a small or medium-sized organization. You might want to choose the best approach which completes the task in the minimum amount of time.\nIt\u2019s actually very easy to check the running time of a particular block of code in your Jupyter notebook.\nJust add the %%time command to check the running time of a particular cell:\nView the code on Gist.\n\nHere, we have the CPU time and the Wall time. The CPU time is the total execution time or runtime for which the CPU was dedicated to a process. Wall time is the time that a clock would have measured as having elapsed between the start of the process and \u2018now\u2019.\n\u00a0\n10: rpy2: R and Python in the Same Jupyter Notebook!\nR and Python are two of the best and most popular open-source programming languages in the data science world. R is mainly used for statistical analysis while Python provides an easy interface to translate mathematical solutions into code.\nHere\u2019s the good news \u2013 we can use both of them in a single Jupyter Notebook! We can make use of both ecosystems and for that, we just need to install rpy2.\nSo, let\u2019s shelve the R versus Python debate for now and enjoy plotting ggplot-level charts in our Jupyter Notebook.\n!pip3 install rpy2\nWe can use both the languages together, and even pass variables between them.\nView the code on Gist.\nView the code on Gist.\nView the code on Gist.\n\u00a0\n\nHere, we created a dataframe df in Python and used that to create a scatterplot using R\u2019s ggplot2 library (the function geom_point). Go ahead and try this out \u2013 you\u2019re sure to love it.\n\u00a0\nEnd Notes\nThis is my essential Python tricks collection. I love using these packages and functions in my day-to-day tasks. Honestly, my productivity has increased and it\u2019s made working in Python more fun than ever before.\nAre there any Python tricks you want me to know apart from these? Let me know in the comments section below and we\u2019ll trade ideas!\nAnd if you\u2019re a Python beginner and a newcomer in data science, you really should check out our comprehensive and best-selling course:\n\nApplied Machine Learning \u2013 Beginner to Professional\n\n\nRelated\n ", "You can see how easy is to track the progress of our code.
