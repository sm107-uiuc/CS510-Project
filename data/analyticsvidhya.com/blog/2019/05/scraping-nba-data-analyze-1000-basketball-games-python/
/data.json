Visualizing data and analyzing trends is one of the most exciting aspects of any data science project. But what if we don\u2019t have proper data? Or the data we have is just not sufficient to draw conclusions?", "That\u2019s where (ethical) web scraping comes in handy. We can source all kinds of data from around the internet \u2013 tabular, images, videos, etc. We just need to know a few specific techniques to extract that data.", "We\u2019ll focus on extracting data from the NBA.com website in this article. I\u2019m a huge basketball fan so I thought why not put my knowledge of web scraping and website creation into sports analysis?", "You\u2019ll find this article useful even if you\u2019re not an NBA or sports fan. You will get an overall picture of how to gather, store and analyze public and unstructured data and how to go about planning and implementing a web data science project. Whether you want to learn how to do data analysis or you\u2019re interested in sports statistics, you will enjoy the next few minutes for sure.", "We\u2019re going to focus on descriptive statistics because that\u2019s always a key element of any data science project.", "The tools we will work with throughout this article are:", "We\u2019ve already seen this in the article heading! We are going to use the official NBA Stats site as a data source. I\u2019m a regular user of that site \u2013 it contains a treasure trove of data for NBA fans (especially us data science folks). Additionally, the site is superbly formatted, which makes it ideal for scraping.", "But we are not going to scrape it. Trust me, there\u2019s an easier and better way to reach the data we\u2019re looking for which I will describe later in the article. We need to first ensure we are not breaking any protocol.", "We need to make sure that we can use the chosen website ethically as our data source. Why? Because we want to be good website citizens and don\u2019t want to do anything that hampers or messes the website\u2019s servers. How do we do this? Answering the below questions should help:", "We are good to go as our goals align with these ethical guidelines.", "As a side note, I encourage you to answer these questions before you scrape any website. Our approach should not breach or mess up other people\u2019s work.", "This is the part where a little knowledge about HTTP and how websites work helps you save a ton of hours. I\u2019m not thoroughly familiar with the site we are trying to get data from, so I need to properly inspect it first to see what\u2019s going on. ", "This is the starting page we get if we open stats.nba.com:", "We get a lot of player stats here which we can put aside for now. We want to get data about games \u2013 not specific players or teams. Hence, we need to find a page where games and results are displayed.", "Moving on to the scores page:", "It\u2019s getting better \u2013 here the full game results and quarter-by-quarter points are displayed. But we still do not have enough details to build a sufficient dataset. What we\u2019re really looking for is this page:", "This is the game page. One game per page, in full detail. Here, we can find a bunch of different data fields. This is a good base for building our future database.", "Now that we\u2019ve identified where we need to go, it\u2019s time to do some real technical inspection. We\u2019re going to figure out what happens in the background when we request this specific page. In order to do that (I\u2019m using FireFox but should be the same or similar for other browsers): ", "Now, we should see all the requests that have been made in the background:", "The site made close to 83 requests just displaying one page! Now, we have to filter out the ones that aren\u2019t relevant for us and see only the \u201cdata\u201d requests. To do that, toggle the XHR button inside the network tab on the top-right:", "We mostly see requests that have got JSON response after toggling the XHR button. That\u2019s good for us because JSON is a popular format to transfer data from the backend to the frontend. There\u2019s a high chance we\u2019ll find our data inside one of these JSON responses. ", "Going through some of the JSON endpoints, I found the one which contains the kind of data we are after.", "This URL returns a JSON which contains all the data points about a game.  That\u2019s why I said earlier that properly inspecting a website before writing a web scraper can save you a ton of hours. There\u2019s already an API we can use so we don\u2019t need to do web scraping to collect data.", "Now, the URL request needs one parameter \u2013\u00a0GameID. Note that each game has a unique GameID. So we have to find a way to collect these Game IDs as well.", "Earlier, we were looking at the scores page. This page has each game and a unique GameID for the given day. One possible solution, which we will implement, is to iterate over each day (from the scores pages), collect all GameIDs and then insert these IDs into a database.", "We will go through these GameIDs and parse JSONs containing game details. Now figure out what data fields we want to collect from the JSON:", "A basketball game has many kinds of data. This data is about teams, points, players, etc. \u2013 there are so many numbers and stats we could collect, it\u2019s mind-blowing! We will narrow our scope to some specific fields for this project:", "One record stores data about one game.", "Generally, when designing a database, the tables and their normalization always depends on the kind of insights we want to gain from the project. For example, you could calculate the winner by looking at the points scored by both teams. Whichever team\u2019s got more points is the winner. But in our case, I\u2019m creating a separate column for the winner. Because I feel like it\u2019s not gonna be a problem for us to have a somewhat redundant field, like this, stored.", "With that said, I don\u2019t create a separate column for the points a team scored in the whole game. I just store the quarterly points by both teams. If we will need to know this data we\u2019ll need to always sum up the quarterly points by one team. I think that\u2019s not a big sacrifice considering that this way we can analyze specifically the quarters of each game.", "We will follow the below steps for fetching and filtering our data:", "Let\u2019s understand each step in a bit more detail.`", "Inspecting even one score page gives us a hint that this page uses a JSON file to get data as well. An example URL of this kind of request:", "Again, rather than scraping data from the page, we use this endpoint to get GameIDs.", "We collect GameIDs from the JSON:", "In this code, data is the parsed JSON we requested in the previous step. We\u2019re collecting the GameIDs in a list called game_ids.", "In this step, we\u2019re using the previously collected GameIDs:", "After storing data about each game played this season, I recognized some outliers in the dataset. I removed the NBA All-Star game from the database because it was a huge outlier with regards to the points total.\u00a0It shouldn\u2019t be lumped together with the regular season games.", "I also had to remove some games that were played in the preseason in early October. So now, we only have regular season data.", "Finally, the fun part: querying the database to generate insightful reports and interesting stats. But first, we need to figure out what reports we want to create:", "These are ad-hoc reports that might be interesting to go through. There are a bunch of other ways to analyze this dataset \u2013 I encourage you to come up with more advanced dashboards.", "Before we start generating reports, we need to install some libraries we\u2019re going to use. ", "First, install pandas to handle data tables:", "Next, instead of matplotlib, we\u2019re going to use a relatively new but easy-to-use plotting library called chartify:", "As a warm-up for our data visualization journey, let\u2019s start off with some simple descriptive reports about our fresh dataset:", "Now let\u2019s jump into the real stuff. We\u2019ll generate a pie chart which tells us if there\u2019s any home court advantage, aka, is there more chance to win if the team plays at home, based on statistics?", "(Chartify doesn\u2019t yet support pie charts so we\u2019re using the pandas wrapper function for this task, which is essentially matplotlib.)", "Interesting. Similar to soccer, NBA teams also have a reasonable advantage of playing at home. The home team won 57% of the games. Considering only regulation time results, home wins: 511, away wins: 338, OT: 47.", "Let\u2019s talk about points. We\u2019ll use the chartify library from here on. Generate a distribution chart of the scored points per game:", "The majority of the games are in the 200-240 range point-wise. That is 100-120 points per team per game. There\u2019s a huge drop in the number of games that are outside of this range.", "Now I\u2019m interested to see if there\u2019s any correlation between the date of a game and the number of points scored. For example in soccer, teams score more goals when the season is ending soon.", "It seems the date of the game doesn\u2019t make any difference to the number of points scored. At least not at a high-level.", "See that gap on the right side of our plot? It seems to be falling somewhere in mid-February. As it turns out, no games were played between Feb 15-20. This was the time for the all-star game which we intentionally excluded from our database earlier. Incredible what a simple visualization can reveal, right?", "It\u2019s always a fun exercise comparing teams to see how they are doing relative to each other.\u00a0For our study, I chose a high performing team and an underperformer:", "These two teams have pretty different point distributions. For Cleveland, it\u2019s very rare to reach 120 points in a game. They usually score between 90 and 110. For Milwaukee, they are usually on the edge or over 120 points. ", "Based on this chart, it\u2019s not surprising to learn that Bucks are the 1st in their conference while the Cavaliers are second-to-last. It would be interesting to see this chart with Kyrie and Lebron back in the team, but that\u2019s for another time!", "We want to see some comebacks. Who doesn\u2019t love a rip-roaring comeback by a team most consider to be out of the game? We\u2019ll take the cases where a team was down in the first half by a lot but managed to win the game:", "The biggest 1st half deficit that one team was able to overcome was 22 points. The winning team scored 70 points in a half in 4 out of these 5 matches.\u00a0", "I want to point out the defensive performance of the Denver Nuggets against Memphis Grizzlies. They restricted the Grizzlies to 32 points in the entire 2nd half. They must have figured something out in the defense in the break.", "It\u2019s this kind of analysis that I love doing through visualizations!", "If we see the biggest comebacks, we need to check out the biggest blowouts as well. Blowouts are essentials games where one team won by a handsome margin:", "The biggest blowout was between the Celtics and the Bulls. Boston won 133-77, a ridiculous 56 points win. The surprising thing is that the game was played in Chicago, so Boston was actually the visiting team. Utah Jazz only scored 68 points which are 17 per quarter per team on average. That\u2019s way below the league average for quarterly points per team (28).", "Now let\u2019s look at things from a different angle. Which gamedays saw teams scoring points that were way above the league average?", "Keep in mind that the average points in an NBA game are 220. So the five days we\u2019re seeing in the above table truly exceeded that average. February 23 is also in this list averaging 235.5 points per game which is outstanding considering that there were 12 games that day.", "This might be subjective according to what each of us consider \u201cexciting\u201d. For the purpose of this article, we will take the number of lead changes during a game. You can set your own metric and generate a new report as well.", "There were 32 lead changes in the Golden State Warriors v Utah Jazz game! The lead changed every 1.5 minutes on average \u2013 that sounds like a pulsating affair. Eventually, GSW won the game 124-123. We\u2019ve got two San Antonio Spurs games on the list, maybe the Spurs tend to play give-and-take type of games more often than others?", "Another way to statistically define exciting games would be based on the number of ties during a game. ", "Interestingly, we get totally different matchups in the top 5 compared to the previous list. 3 of the 5 games went into overtime. There were 26 ties during the Suns v Wizards game which means one team tied the game every 108 seconds on average.", "Yes, we will look at a few essential referee stats as well. Love them or hate them, they are a huge part of the game.", "The number of referees in the league (who officiated any games): 68.", "Most prolific referees: Karl Lane, Tyler Ford, Pat Fraher, Scott Foster, and Josh Tiven. Each of them officiated 48 games. There were 124 game days in our dataset. That means you cannot watch 3 game days in a row without any of them being on or near the court. Impressive!", "This article is intended to inspire you on how to make use of web data or other kinds of data. There are more and more tools available that you can use to draw insights from public data. I hope this walkthrough gives you some ideas about how to make data work for you.", "You can also use this analysis to build machine learning models. We\u2019ve done the data cleaning and exploration part \u2013 take it forward and use your favorite algorithms to predict a team\u2019s chances of winning. The possibilities are endless.", "If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments section below.
