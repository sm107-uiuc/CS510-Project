The sheer amount of content I can watch on a single platform is staggering. In fact, a lot of my data science learning has happened through YouTube videos!", "So, I was browsing YouTube a few weeks ago searching for a certain category to watch. That\u2019s when my data scientist thought process kicked in. Given my love for web scraping and machine learning, could I extract data about YouTube videos and build a model to classify them into their respective categories?", "I was intrigued! This sounded like the perfect opportunity to combine my existing Python and data science knowledge with my curiosity to learn something new. And Analytics Vidhya\u2019s internship challenge offered me the chance to pen down my learning in article form.", "Web scraping is a skill I feel every data science enthusiast should know. It is immensely helpful when we\u2019re looking for data for our project or want to analyze specific data present only on a website. Keep in mind though, web scraping should not cross ethical and legal boundaries.", "In this article, we\u2019ll learn how to use web scraping to extract YouTube video data using Selenium and Python. We will then use the NLTK library to clean the data and then build a model to classify these videos based on specific categories.", "You can also check out the below tutorials on web scraping using different libraries:", "Note: BeautifulSoup is another library for web scraping. You can learn about this using our free course- Introduction to Web Scraping using Python.", "Selenium is a popular tool for automating browsers. It\u2019s primarily used for testing in the industry but is also very handy for web scraping. You must have come across Selenium if you\u2019ve worked in the IT field.", "We can easily program a Python script to automate a web browser using Selenium. It gives us the freedom we need to efficiently extract the data and store it in our preferred format for future use. ", "Selenium requires a driver to interface with our chosen browser. Chrome, for example, requires ChromeDriver, which needs to be installed before we start scraping. The Selenium web driver speaks directly to the browser using the browser\u2019s own engine to control it. This makes it incredibly fast.", "There are a few things we must know before jumping into web scraping:", "Time to power up your favorite Python IDE (that\u2019s Jupyter notebooks for me)! Let\u2019s get our hands dirty and start coding.", "Step 3:\u00a0Move the driver file to a PATH:", "Go to the downloads directory, unzip the file, and move it to usr/local/bin PATH.", "We\u2019re all set to begin web scraping now.", "In this article, we\u2019ll be scraping the video ID, video title, and video description of a particular category from YouTube. The categories we\u2019ll be scraping are:", "With me so far? Now, write the below code to start fetching the links from the page and run the cell. This should fetch all the links present on the web page and store it in a list. ", "Note: Traverse all the way down to load all the videos on that page.", "The above code will fetch the \u201chref\u201d attribute of the anchor tag we searched for. ", "Now, we need to create a dataframe with 4 columns \u2013 \u201clink\u201d, \u201ctitle\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d, and \u201ccategory\u201d. We will store the details of videos for different categories in these columns:", "We are all set to scrape the video details from YouTube. Here\u2019s the Python code to do it:", "Let\u2019s breakdown this code block to understand what we just did:", "During each iteration, our code saves the extracted data inside the dataframe we created earlier.", "We have to follow the aforementioned steps for the remaining five categories. We should have six different dataframes once we are done with this. Now, it\u2019s time to merge them together into a single dataframe:", "Voila! We have our final dataframe containing all the desired details of a video from all the categories mentioned above. ", "In this section, we\u2019ll use the popular NLTK library to clean the data present in the \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d columns. NLP enthusiasts will love this section!", "Before we start cleaning the data, we need to store all the columns separately so that we can perform different operations quickly and easily:", "Now, create a list in which we can store our cleaned data. We will store this data in a dataframe later. Write the following code to create a list and do some data cleaning on the \u201ctitle\u201d column from df_title:", "Did you see what we did here? We removed all the punctuation from the titles and only kept the English root words. After all these iterations, we are ready with our list full of data.", "We need to follow the same steps to clean the \u201cdescription\u201d column from df_description:", "Note: The range is selected as per the rows in our dataset.", "Now, convert these lists into dataframes:", "Next, we need to label encode the categories. The \u201cLabelEncoder()\u201d function encodes labels with a value between 0 and n_classes \u2013 1 where n is the number of distinct labels.", "Here, we have applied label encoding on df_category and stored the result into dfcategory.\u00a0We can store our cleaned and encoded data in into a new dataframe:", "We\u2019re not quite all the way done with our cleaning and transformation part.", "We should create a bag-of-words so that our model can understand the keywords from that bag to classify videos accordingly. Here\u2019s the code to do create a bag-of-words:", "Note: Here, we created 1500 features from data stored in the lists \u2013 corpus and corpus1. \u201cX\u201d stores all the features and \u201cy\u201d stores our encoded data.", "We are all set for the most anticipated part of a data scientist\u2019s role \u2013 model building!", "Before we build our model, we need to divide the data into training set and test set:", "Make sure that your test set meets the following two conditions:", "We can use the following code to split the data:", "Time to train the model! We will use the random forest algorithm here. So let\u2019s go ahead and train the model using the\u00a0RandomForestClassifier() function:", "We can now check the performance of our model on the test set:", "We get an impressive 96.05% accuracy. Our entire process went pretty smoothly! But we\u2019re not done yet \u2013 we need to analyze our results as well to fully understand what we achieved.", "The result will give the following attributes:", "We can check our results by creating a\u00a0confusion matrix as well:", "The confusion matrix will be a 6\u00d76 matrix since we have six classes in our dataset.", "I\u2019ve always wanted to combine my interest in scraping and extracting data with NLP and machine learning. So I loved immersing myself in this project and penning down my approach.", "In this article, we just witnessed Selenium\u2019s potential as a web scraping tool.\u00a0All the code used in this article is\u00a0random forest algorithm Congratulations on successfully scraping and creating a dataset to classify videos!", "I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on this article.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
