The languages we use to build our data science models have to evolve with it. Remember when R was the go-to language? That was swiftly overtaken by Python. Julia also came up last year for data science and now there\u2019s another language that is blossoming.", "Yes, I\u2019m talking about Swift for data science.", "\u201cI always hope that when I start looking at a new language, there will be some mind-opening new ideas to find, and Swift definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint. Swift tries to be expressive, flexible, concise, safe, easy to use, and fast. Most languages compromise significantly in at least one of these areas.\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Howard", "When Jeremy Howard endorses a language and starts using it for his daily data science work, you need to drop everything and listen.", "In this article, we will learn about Swift as a programming language and how it fits into the data science space. If you\u2019re a Python user, you\u2019ll notice the subtle differences and the incredible similarities between the two. There\u2019s a lot of code here as well so let\u2019s get started!", "You can also enrol in this free course on Swift where we cover all these concepts in a structured manner alongwith an awesoem bonsu project: Learn Swift for Data Science", "\u201cPyTorch was created to overcome the gaps in Tensorflow.

Everyone is talking about it. Here are a few reasons why you should learn Swift:", "Here is Jeremy Howard articulating how good Swift is:", "Before we start with the nitty-gritty details of performing data science using Swift, let\u2019s get a brief introduction to the basics of the Swift programming language.", "The current state of Swift for Data Science is primarily made up of two ecosystems:", "The open-source ecosystem is one where we can download and run Swift on any operating system or machine. We can build machine learning applications using really cool Swift libraries, like Swift for TensorFlow, SwiftAI and SwiftPlot.", "Swift also lets us seamlessly import mature data science libraries from Python like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn. So if you had any hesitation about switching over to Swift from Python, you\u2019re well covered!", "The\u00a0Apple ecosystem, on the other hand, is impressive in its own right. There are useful libraries like CoreML that let us train large models in Python and directly import them in Swift for inferencing. Additionally, it also comes with a plethora of pre-trained state of the art models that we can directly use to build iOS/macOS applications.", "There are other interesting libraries like Swift-CoreML-Transformers that let us run state-of-the-art text generation models like the GPT-2, BERT, etc. on the iPhone.", "And there are multiple other libraries that give a good level of functionality when you need to build machine learning-based applications for Apple devices.", "There are multiple differences between the two ecosystems.

We will be using that so that you can quickly get up to speed with it without spending much time on the installation process.", "You can follow the below steps to open a Colab notebook that is Swift-enabled:", "Sweet! If you want to work with Swift locally on your own system then here a few links that you can follow:", "Now, let\u2019s quickly cover some basic Swift functions before jumping into the data science aspect of using it.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already used this before. It works the very same way as it does in Python. Simply call print()\u00a0with whatever you want to print inside the parenthesis:", "Swift provides two useful options to create variables: let and var.\u00a0let is used to create a \u201cconstant\u201d which is a variable whose value cannot change anywhere further in the program. var is very similar to the variables that we see in Python \u2013 you can change the value stored in it anytime further in the program.", "Let\u2019s look at an example to see the difference. Create two variables a and b:", "Here\u2019s a pro-tip: use var for temporary variables or variables you want to use for some intermediate calculations.", "Similarly, use let\u00a0for things like storing the training data, results, etc. \u2013 basically the values that you do not want to change or mess up.", "Swift supports all the common data types, like Integer, String, Float and Double. We can assign any variable with a value, and its type will automatically be detected by Swift:", "Let\u2019s have a quick quiz. Create a constant with an explicit type of `Float` and a value of 4 and post the solution in the comments below!", "There\u2019s a simple way to include values in strings \u2013 write the value in parentheses, and write a backslash (\\) before the parentheses. For example:", "You can use three double quotation marks (\"\"\") for strings that take up multiple lines.", "Swift supports both list and dictionary data structures just like Python (there\u2019s that comparison again!). Though the advantage here is that unlike Python, we do not need separate syntax like \u201c{}\u201d for dictionary and \u201c[]\u201d for a list.", "Let\u2019s create a list and a dictionary in Swift:", "We can access the elements of a List or a Dictionary by writing the index/key inside the \u201c[]\u201d brackets (similar to Python):", "The above code will add the key-value pair of \u201cJayne\u201d and \u201cPublic Relations\u201d to the dictionary. This will be the output if you print the above dictionary:", "Looping is one of the most important features of any programming language and Swift doesn\u2019t disappoint here. It not only supports all the conventional looping mechanisms (for, while, etc.) but also implements some variations of its own.", "Very similar to Python, you can use the for loop with Lists or with ranges in Swift:", "The three dots in the first example are used to denote \u201crange\u201d in Swift. If we want to do something in the range of a to b, we will use the syntax a\u2026b.", "Similarly, if we want to exclude the last number, we can just change the three dots to \u201c..<\u201d like a..<b. Try playing around with this and see how many times you get it right!", "Another important point to note here is that unlike Python, Swift doesn\u2019t use the concept of indentation but uses curly brackets \u201c{}\u201d to denote code hierarchy.", "You can use the while and other types of loops in a similar fashion in Swift. You can learn more about loops in Swift here.", "Swift supports conditional statements like if, if..else, if..else..if, nested if and even the switch statement (that Python doesn\u2019t support). The syntax for an if statement if quite simple:", "The boolean_expression can be any comparison and the statements that you write inside the if block will only be executed if the result of the comparison or the expression evaluates to true. You can read about other conditionals here.", "A Swift function looks syntactically very similar to a function in Python. The major difference here is that we use the func\u00a0keyword instead of\u00a0def\u00a0and we explicitly mention the data types of the arguments and the return type of the function.", "Here is how you can write a basic function in Swift:", "And just like conditionals, we use curly brackets \u201c{}\u201d to denote the code block that belongs to this function.", "Writing comments is one of the most important aspects of good code. This is true across any industry and role you work in. This is the most important programming aspect you should learn!", "Use comments to include text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by Swift.", "Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):", "Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/):", "Now that you are familiar with the basics of Swift, let\u2019s learn about an interesting feature \u2013 using Python libraries in Swift itself!", "Swift supports interoperability with Python. What this means is you can import useful Python libraries from Swift, call their functions, and convert values between Swift and Python seamlessly.", "This gives incredible power to Swift\u2019s data science ecosystem. This ecosystem is still pretty young and is still developing and you can already use mature libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib from Python for filling the gaps in existing Swift offerings.", "In order to use Python\u2019s modules in Swift, you can just import Python right away and load whatever library you want to use!", "This is quite similar to the way you\u2019d use NumPy in Python, isn\u2019t it? You can do the same for other packages like matplotlib:", "You have learned quite a bit about Swift already. It\u2019s now time to build your first model!", "Swift4Tensorflow is one of the most mature libraries in the open-source ecosystem of Swift. We can easily build machine learning and deep learning models using a very simple Keras-like syntax in native Swift.", "It gets even more interesting! Swift4Tensorflow isn\u2019t just a Swift wrapper around TensorFlow but it\u2019s being developed as a feature of the language itself. It is widely expected to become a core part of the language in the near future.", "What this means is that the amazing set of Engineers from Apple\u2019s Swift team and Google\u2019s Tensorflow team will make sure that you are able to do high-performance machine learning in Swift.", "The library also adds many useful features to Swift like native support for automatic differentiation (which reminds me of Autograd in PyTorch) to make it even more compatible with numeric computing use-cases.", "Let\u2019s understand the problem statement we\u2019ll be working with in this section. You might be familiar with it if you\u2019ve touched the deep learning field before.", "We will be building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images into digits using the MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits that we can use for training image classification models:", "This dataset is a fairly common dataset for working with Computer Vision problems so I am not going to describe it in great detail. If you want to know more about it, you can read it here.", "Before we can start building the model, we need to download the dataset and pre-process it. For your convenience, I have already created a GitHub repository with the pre-processing code and the data.", "Let\u2019s download the setup code, download the dataset and import the necessary libraries:", "Your dataset will be now be downloaded in Colab. Let\u2019s load the dataset:", "We will plot some images from the dataset to get an idea about what we\u2019re working with:", "This is how our images look like:", "It seems pretty intuitive, right? The first digit is a handwritten 0 and the second one is a 4.", "Let\u2019s now define the architecture of the model. I am using the LeNet-5 architecture which is a fairly basic CNN model using 2 convolution layers with average pooling and 3 dense layers.", "The last dense layer has a shape of 10 because we have 10 target classes, one for each digit from 0 to 9:", "You would have noticed that the code looks very familiar to how you write code to create models in Python frameworks like Keras, PyTorch or TensorFlow.", "The simplicity of writing code is one of the biggest selling points of Swift.", "Swift4Tensorflow supports multiple layer types right out of the box and you can read more about them here.", "Similarly, we need an optimizer function to train our model. We are going to use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which is available in Swift4Tensorflow:", "Swift4Tensorflow supports many additional optimizers. You can choose your pick based on your project:", "Now that everything is set up, let\u2019s train the model!", "The above code runs a training loop that feeds the dataset examples into the model to help it make better predictions. Here are the training steps that we follow:", "The\u00a0epochCount variable is the number of times to loop over the dataset collection. Go ahead and give it a try!", "How many epochs did it take for you to achieve a 90%+ accuracy on the test set?", "I was able to get 97%+ accuracy in both train and test sets in just 12 epochs.", "Though it\u2019s helpful to print out the model\u2019s training progress, it is often more\u00a0helpful to see this progress.", "Let\u2019s visualize the train and test stats that we captured during the training of the model.", "This is how the train and test accuracies evolved during the training process:", "The way industry experts are reacting to Swift is mind-boggling, it feels like a language that has the potential to not only become one of the mainstream languages for data science but also a language that is going to be used for building applications based on machine learning for the real world.", "Currently, it is in infancy and the libraries around data science and numeric computing are still developing. Yet, it has a strong industry backing behind it and I look forward to a future where it will have a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries- maybe even better than what Python has today.", "Here are a few libraries of Swift that you can explore further:", "All the code used in this article is available on Github", "Have you used Swift before?
