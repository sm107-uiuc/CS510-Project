We need more data!", "If this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone! It\u2019s the eternal problem of wanting more data to train our machine learning models. We don\u2019t get cleaned and ready-for-use Excel or .csv files in data science projects, right?", "So how do we deal with the obstacle of the paucity of data?", "One of the most effective and simple ways to do this is through web scraping. I have personally found web scraping a very helpful technique to gather data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.", "But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you\u2019re looking for.", "So in this article, we will learn the different components of web scraping and then dive straight into Python to see how to perform web scraping using the popular and highly effective BeautifulSoup library.", "We have also created a free course for this article \u2013 Introduction to Web Scraping using Python. This structured format will help you learn better.", "A note of caution here \u2013 web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website\u2019s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.", "You\u2019ll come across multiple libraries and frameworks in Python for web scraping. Here are three popular ones that do the task with efficiency and aplomb:", "Here\u2019s a brilliant illustration of the three main components that make up web scraping:", "Let\u2019s understand these components in detail. We\u2019ll do this by scraping hotel details like the name of the hotel and price per room from the goibibo website:", "Note: Always follow the robots.txt file of the target website which is also known as the robot exclusion protocol. This tells web robots which pages not to crawl.", "So, looks like we are allowed to scrape the data from our targeted URL. We are good to go and write the script of our web robot. Let\u2019s begin!", "The first step in web scraping is to navigate to the target website and download the source code of the web page. We are going to use the requests library to do this. A couple of other libraries to make requests and download the source code are http.client and urlib2.", "Once we have downloaded the source code of the webpage, we need to filter the contents that we need:", "The next step in web scraping is to parse this data into an HTML Parser and for that, we will use the BeautifulSoup library. Now, if you have noticed our target web page, the details of a particular hotel are on a different card like most of the web pages.", "So the next step would be to filter this card data from the complete source code. Next, we will select the card and click on the \u2018Inspect Element\u2019 option to get the source code of that particular card. You will get something like this:", "The class name of all the cards would be the same and we can get a list of those cards by just passing the tag name and attributes like the <class> tag with its name like I\u2019ve shown below:", "We have filtered the cards data from the complete source code of the web page and each card here contains the information about a separate hotel. Select only the Hotel Name, perform the Inspect Element step, and do the same with the Room Price:", "Now, for each card, we have to find the above Hotel Name which can be extracted from the <p> tag only. This is because there is only one <p> tag for each card and Room Price by <li> tag along with the <class> tag and class name:", "The final step is to store the extracted data in the CSV file. Here, for each card, we will extract the Hotel Name and Price and store it in a Python dictionary. We will then finally append it to a list.", "Next, let\u2019s go ahead and transform this list to a Pandas data frame as it allows us to convert the data frame into CSV or JSON files:", "Congrats! We have successfully created a basic web scraper. I want you to try out these steps and try to get more data like ratings and address of the hotel. Now let\u2019s see how to perform some common tasks like scraping URLs, Email IDs, Images, and Scrape Data on Page Loads.", "Two of the most common features we try to scrape using web scraping are website URLs and email IDs. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve worked on projects or challenges where extracting email IDs in bulk was required (see marketing teams!). So let\u2019s see how to scrape these aspects in Python.", "The above solutions are efficient only when we want to scrape data from just one page. But what if we want the same steps to be done on multiple webpages?", "There are many websites that can do that for us at some price. But here\u2019s the good news \u2013 we can also write our own web scraper using Python! Let\u2019s see how to do that in the live coding window below.", "In this section, we will scrape all the images from the same goibibo webpage. The first step would be the same to navigate to the target website and download the source code. Next, we will find all the images using the <img> tag:", "From all the image tags, select only the src part. Also, notice that the hotel images are available in jpg format. So we will select only those:", "Now that we have a list of image URLs, all we have to do is request the image content and write it in a file. Make sure that you open the file \u2018wb\u2019 (write binary) form:", "You can also update the initial page URL by page number and request them iteratively to gather data in a large amount.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the web page of the steam community Grant Theft Auto V Reviews. You will notice that the complete content of the webpage will not get loaded in one go.", "We need to scroll down to load more content on the web page (the age of endless scrolling!). This is an optimization technique called Lazy Loading used by the backend developers of the website.", "But the problem for us is when we try to scrape the data from this page, we will only get a limited content of the webpage:", "Some websites also create a \u2018Load More\u2019 button instead of the endless scrolling idea. This will load more content only when you click that button. The problem of limited content still remains. So let\u2019s see how to scrape these kinds of web pages.", "Navigate to the target URL and open the \u2018Inspect Element Network\u2019 window. Next, click on the reload button and it will record the network for you like the order of image loads, API requests, POST requests, etc.", "Clear the current records and scroll down. You will notice that as you scroll down, the webpage is sending requests for more data:", "Scroll further and you will see the pattern in which the website is making requests. Look at the following URLs \u2013 only some of the parameter values are changing and you can easily generate these URLs through a simple Python code:", "You need to follow the same steps to crawl and store the data by sending requests to each of the pages one by one.", "This was a simple and beginner-friendly introduction to web scraping in Python using the powerful BeautifulSoup library. I\u2019ve honestly found web scraping to be super helpful when I\u2019m looking to work on a new project or need information for an existing one.", "Note: If you want to learn this in a more structured format, we have a free course where we teach web scrapping BeatifulSoup. You can enroll here \u2013 Introduction to Web Scraping using Python", "As I mentioned, there are other libraries as well which you can use for performing web scraping.
