That number jumps up even more in machine learning hackathons. Can you remember the last time you worked on a challenge that had you thinking \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of data before!\u201d", "Working with graph data is a unique challenge. That\u2019s why we were thrilled to host the ML Hikeathon in partnership with Hike last month. And our community loved it too \u2013 more than 5300 data scientists from all over the world participated in the 9-day event!", "There was a lot to appreciate and gain by participating in this hackathon, including:", "If you didn\u2019t participate in the ML Hikeathon, you missed out on a lot of fun! But don\u2019t worry \u2013 head over to our DataHack platform and enrol in upcoming hackathons and practice problems today.", "The ML Hikeathon was a marathon competition spanning a full 9 days! The hackathon went live on the midnight of March 30th, 2019 and closed on 7th April 2019.", "Given the nature of the problem statement, it would definitely have taken data scientists some time to understand the requirements and frame their solution. That\u2019s what makes a 9-day hackathon so unique \u2013 you get time to think through and experiment with your approach \u2013 but the level of the challenge goes up several notches.", "Here, I have to tip my hat to the data scientists who came up with the top solutions. The creativity and knowledge displayed by these data scientists were sublime.", "Hike is a popular social platform.\u00a0Predicting links in their network forms the basis for recommending new friends to their users. And in turn, high-quality recommendations help in the creation of new social connections between existing users.", "So, the problem statement involved building a model for Link Prediction on Hike\u2019s Social Network.\u00a0This link prediction model\u00a0would increase the retention of new users by helping them find friends as they join the platform. In other words, the aim was to develop an algorithm that can predict whether a Hike user will chat up another Hike user who is a part of his/her phone contact list.", "The evaluation metric used was Area under the Curve (AUC).", "The data for this competition was a subset of Hike\u2019s social graph and the anonymized features of users. The participants were provided with three files:", "Alright \u2013 let\u2019s put our hands together for the winners! These winners\u00a0used different and unique approaches to rise up the leaderboard. Below are the top 3 winners on the hackathon leaderboard:", "Let\u2019s look at each of their winning solutions. We have penned down the approaches in the winners\u2019 own words. There\u2019s a lot to learn from them so take notes!", "We strongly recommend going through these approaches as they will help shape your mindset for future hackathons. Look at these approaches through a dataset-agnostic lens. Understand how a winner frames their thinking to approach a hackathon as tricky as this one.", "Feature engineering was the name of the game for Sourabh and Datageek.", "Some more feature ideas they shared were:", "They used a larger computer machine with 64GB RAM and 16 cores to train due to the large size of the data.", "This provided him a score of 0.938988506 on the private leaderboard. A brilliant result!", "Here\u2019s a brief overview of their approach:", "Feature creation played a very important role in our climb up the leaderboard. We used three major sets of features in our final model:", "Graph Features:\nWe created three graphs from the data set:", "Some of the metrics used include:", "This provided them with the first rank and an AUC score of 0.940911. Congratulations again to our winners!", "Below are two key takeaways from the ML Hikeathon:", "It was great interacting with these winners and\u00a0understanding their approach during the\u00a0competition. We see a heavy emphasis on feature engineering again. It\u2019s no coincidence that creating new features is often the difference between several positions in the leaderboard.", "Hopefully, you will be able to evaluate what you missed out.
