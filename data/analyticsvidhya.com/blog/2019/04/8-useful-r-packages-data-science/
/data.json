I have relied on it since my days of learning statistics back in university. In fact, R is still my go-to language for machine learning projects.", "Three things primarily attracted me to R:", "R offers a plethora of packages for performing machine learning tasks, including \u2018dplyr\u2019 for data manipulation, \u2018ggplot2\u2019 for data visualization, \u2018caret\u2019 for building ML models, etc.", "There are even R packages for specific functions, including credit risk scoring, scraping data from websites, econometrics, etc. There\u2019s a reason why R is beloved among statisticians worldwide \u2013 the sheer amount of R packages available makes life so much easier.", "In this article, I will showcase eight R packages that have gone under the radar among data scientists but are incredibly useful for performing specific machine learning tasks. To get you started, I have included an example along with the code for each package.", "Trust me, your love for R is about to undergo another revolution!", "I have broadly divided these R packages into three categories:", "R is an amazing tool for visualizing data.\u00a0The ease with which we can generate all kinds of plots with just one or two lines of code? Truly a time saver.", "R provides seemingly countless ways to visualize your data. Even when I\u2019m using Python for a certain task, I come back to R for exploring and visualizing my data. I\u2019m sure most R users feel the same way!", "Let\u2019s look at a few awesome but lesser-known R packages for performing exploratory data analysis.", "This is my go-to package for performing exploratory data analysis. From plotting the structure of the data to Q-Q plots and even creating reports for your dataset, this package does it all.", "Let\u2019s see what DataExplorer can do using an example. Consider that we have stored our data in the data variable. Now, we want to figure out the percentage of missing values in every feature present. This is extremely useful when we\u2019re working with massive datasets and computing the sum of missing values might be time-consuming.", "You can install DataExplorer using the below code:", "Now let\u2019s see what DataExplorer can do for us:", "We get a really intuitive plot for missing values:", "One of my favorite aspects of DataExplorer is the comprehensive report we can generate using just one line of code:", "Below are the different kinds of factors we get in this report:", "You can access the full report through\u00a0this link. A VERY useful package.", "How about a \u2018drag-and-drop\u2019 add-in for generating plots in R? That\u2019s right \u2013 esquisse is a package that lets you get on with creating plots without having to code them.", "Esquisse is built on top of the ggplot2 package. That means you can interactively explore your data in the esquisse environment by generating ggplot2 graphs.", "Use the below code to install and load up esquisse on your machine:", "You can also launch the esquisse add-in via the RStudio menu. The user interface of esquisse looks like this:", "Pretty cool, right? Go ahead and play around with different types of plots \u2013 it\u2019s an eye-opening experience.", "Ah, building machine learning models in R. The holy grail we data scientists strive for when we take up new machine learning projects. You might have used the \u2018caret\u2019 package for building models before.", "Now, let me introduce you to a few under-the-radar R packages that might change the way you approach the model building process.", "One of the biggest reasons Python surged ahead of R was thanks to its machine learning focused libraries (like scikit-learn). For a long time, R lacked this ability. Sure you could use different packages for performing different ML tasks but there was no one package that could do it all. We had to call three different libraries for building three different models.", "And then the MLR package came along. It is an incredible package which allows us to perform all sorts of machine learning tasks. MLR includes all the popular machine learning algorithms we use in our projects.", "I strongly recommend going through the below article to deep dive into MLR:", "Let\u2019s see how to install MLR and build a random forest model on the iris dataset:", "A common issue with different functions available in R (that do the same thing) is that they can have different interfaces and arguments. Take the random forest algorithm for example. The code you would use in the randomforest package and the caret package are different, right?", "Like MLR,\u00a0parsnip\u00a0removes the problem of referring to multiple packages for a certain machine learning algorithm. It successfully imitates Python\u2019s scikit-learn package in R.", "Let\u2019s look at the below simple example to give you an insight into how parsnip works for a linear regression problem:", "Ranger is one of my favorite R packages. I regularly use random forests to build baseline models \u2013 especially when I\u2019m participating in data science hackathons.", "Here\u2019s a question \u2013 how many times have you encountered slow random forest computation for huge datasets in R? It happens way too often on my old machine.", "Packages like\u00a0caret, random forests and rf take a lot of time to compute the results. The \u2018Ranger\u2019 package accelerates our model building process for the random forest algorithm. It helps you swiftly create a large number of trees in less amount of time.", "Let\u2019s code a random forest model using Ranger:", "Quite an impressive performance. You should try out Ranger on more complex datasets and see how much faster your computations become.", "Exhausted while running your linear regression model on different parts of data and computing the evaluation metrics for each model? The purrr package comes to your rescue.", "You can also build generalized linear models (glm) for different data pieces and compute p-values for every feature in the form of a list. The advantages of purrr are endless!", "Let\u2019s see an example to understand its functionality. We will build a linear regression model here and subset the R-squared values:", "So did you observe? This\u00a0example uses purrr to solve a fairly realistic problem:", "Saves us a lot of time, right? Instead of running three different models and three commands to subset the R-squared value, we just use one line of code.", "Let\u2019s look at some other packages that don\u2019t necessarily fall under the \u2018machine learning\u2019 umbrella. I have found these useful in terms of working with R in general.", "Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular applications of machine learning. It\u2019s an inescapable reality in today\u2019s digital world. And Twitter is a prime target for extracting Tweets and building models to understand and predict sentiment.", "Now, there are a few R packages for extracting/scraping Tweets and performing sentiment analysis. The \u2018rtweet\u2019 package does the same. So how is it different from the other packages out there?", "\u2018rtweet\u2019 also helps you check for tweet trends from R itself. Awesome!", "All users must be authorized to interact with Twitter\u2019s API.\u00a0To become authorized, follow the instructions below:", "2. Create and save your access token", "For a detailed step by step procedure to get authentication from Twitter please follow this link here.", "You can search for tweets with certain hashtags simply by the line of code mentioned below. Let\u2019s try and search for all the tweets with the hashtag\u00a0 #avengers since Infinity War is all set for release.", "You can even access the user IDs of people following a certain page. Let\u2019s see an example:", "You can do a whole lot more with this package. Try it out and do not forget to update the community if you find something exciting.", "Love coding in R and Python both but want to stick to RStudio? Reticulate is the answer! The package solves this prominent problem by providing a Python interface in R. You can easily use major python libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib inside R itself!", "You can also transfer your progress with data easily from Python to R and R to Python with just one line of code. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Check out the below code block to see how easy it is to run python in R.", "Before you move on to directly installing reticulate in R, you will have to install TensorFlow and Keras first.", "And you are good to go! Run the commands I have provided above in the screenshot and try out your data science projects in a similar manner.", "Here are two other utility R packages for all your programming nerds!", "Do you update your R packages individually? It can be a tedious task, especially when there are multiple packages at play.", "The \u2018InstallR\u2019 package allows you to update R and all its packages using just one command!\u00a0Instead of checking the latest version of every package, we can use InstallR to update all the packages in one go.", "Which package do you use for installing libraries from GitHub? Most of us relied on the \u2018devtools\u2019 package for a long time. It seemed to be the only way. But there was a caveat \u2013 we needed to remember the developer\u2019s name to install a package:", "With the \u2018githubinstall\u2019 package, the developer name is no longer required.", "This is by no means an exhaustive list. There are plenty of other R packages which serve useful functions but have been overlooked by the majority.", "Do you know of any packages that I have missed in this article? Or have you used any of the above-mentioned ones for your project? I would love to hear from you!
