Learn about deep Q-learning, and build a deep Q-learning model in Python using keras and gym."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I have always been fascinated with games. The seemingly infinite options available to perform an action under a tight timeline \u2013 it\u2019s a thrilling experience. There\u2019s nothing quite like it.", "So when I read about the incredible algorithms DeepMind was coming up with (like AlphaGo and AlphaStar), I was hooked. I wanted to learn how to make these systems on my own machine. And that led me into the world of deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL).", "Deep RL is relevant even if you\u2019re not into gaming. Just check out the sheer variety of functions currently using Deep RL for research:", "What about industry-ready applications? Well, here are two of the most commonly cited Deep RL use cases:", "The scope of Deep RL is IMMENSE. This is a great time to enter into this field and make a career out of it.", "In this article, I aim to help you take your first steps into the world of deep reinforcement learning. We\u2019ll use one of the most popular algorithms in RL, deep Q-learning, to understand how deep RL works. And the icing on the cake? We will implement all our learning in an awesome case study using Python.", "There are certain concepts you should be aware of before wading into the depths of deep reinforcement learning. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered.", "I have previously written various articles on the nuts and bolts of reinforcement learning to introduce concepts like multi-armed bandit, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo\u00a0learning and temporal differencing. I recommend going through these guides in the below sequence:", "These articles are good enough for getting a detailed overview of basic RL from the beginning.", "However, note that the articles linked above are in no way prerequisites for the reader to understand Deep Q-Learning. We will do a quick recap of the basic RL concepts before exploring what is deep Q-Learning and its implementation details.", "A reinforcement learning task is about training an agent which interacts with its environment. The agent arrives at different scenarios known as states by performing actions. Actions lead to rewards which could be positive and negative.", "The agent has only one purpose here \u2013 to maximize its total reward across an episode.\u00a0This episode is anything and everything that happens between the first state and the last or terminal state within the environment. We reinforce the agent to learn to perform the best actions by experience. This is the strategy or policy.", "Let\u2019s take an example of the ultra-popular PubG game:", "Now, in order to kill that enemy or get a positive reward, there is a sequence of actions required. This is where the concept of delayed or postponed reward comes into play. The crux of RL is learning to perform these sequences and maximizing the reward.", "An important point to note \u2013 each state within an environment is a consequence of its previous state which in turn is a result of its previous state. However, storing all this information, even for environments with short episodes, will become readily infeasible.", "To resolve this, we assume that each state follows a Markov property, i.e., each state depends solely on the previous state and the transition from that state to the current state. Check out the below maze to better understand the intuition behind how this works:", "Now, there are 2 scenarios with 2 different starting points and the agent traverses different paths to reach the same penultimate state. Now it doesn\u2019t matter what path the agent takes to reach the red state. The next step to exit the maze and reach the last state is by going right. Clearly, we only needed the information on the red/penultimate state to find out the next best action which is exactly what the Markov property implies.", "Let\u2019s say we know the expected reward of each action at every step. This would essentially be like a cheat sheet for the agent! Our agent will know exactly which action to perform.", "It will perform the sequence of actions that will eventually generate the maximum total reward. This total reward is also called the Q-value and we will formalise our strategy as:", "The above equation states that the Q-value yielded from being at state s and performing action a is the immediate reward r(s,a) plus the highest Q-value possible from the next state s\u2019. Gamma here is the discount factor which controls the contribution of rewards further in the future.", "Q(s\u2019,a) again depends on Q(s\u201d,a) which will then have a coefficient of gamma squared. So, the Q-value depends on Q-values of future states as shown here:", "Adjusting the value of gamma will diminish or increase the contribution of future rewards.", "Since this is a recursive equation, we can start with making arbitrary assumptions for all q-values. With experience, it will converge to the optimal policy. In practical situations, this is implemented as an update:", "where alpha is the learning rate or step size. This simply determines to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information.", "Q-learning is a simple yet quite powerful algorithm to create a cheat sheet for our agent. This helps the agent figure out exactly which action to perform.", "But what if this cheatsheet is too long? Imagine an environment with 10,000 states and 1,000 actions per state. This would create a table of 10 million cells. Things will quickly get out of control!", "It is pretty clear that we can\u2019t infer the Q-value of new states from already explored states. This presents two problems:", "Here\u2019s a thought \u2013 what if we approximate these Q-values with machine learning models such as a neural network? Well, this was the idea behind DeepMind\u2019s algorithm that led to its acquisition by Google for 500 million dollars!", "In deep Q-learning, we use a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The state is given as the input and the Q-value of all possible actions is generated as the output. The comparison between Q-learning & deep Q-learning is wonderfully illustrated below:", "So, what are the steps involved in reinforcement learning using deep Q-learning networks (DQNs)?", "The section in green represents the target. We can argue that it is predicting its own value, but since R is the unbiased true reward, the network is going to update its gradient using backpropagation to finally converge.", "So far, this all looks great. We understood how neural networks can help the agent learn the best actions. However, there is a challenge when we compare deep RL to deep learning (DL):", "As you can see in the above code, the target is continuously changing with each iteration. In deep learning, the target variable does not change and hence the training is stable, which is just not true for RL.", "To summarise, we often depend on the policy or value functions in reinforcement learning to sample actions. However, this is frequently changing as we continuously\u00a0learn what to explore. As we play out the game, we get to know more about the ground truth values of states and actions and hence, the output is also changing.", "So, we try to learn to map\u00a0for a constantly changing input and output. But then what is the solution?", "Since the same network is calculating the predicted value and the target value, there could be a lot of divergence between these two. So, instead of using 1one neural network for learning, we can use two.", "We could use a separate network to estimate the target. This target network has the same architecture as the function approximator but with frozen parameters. For every C iterations (a hyperparameter), the parameters from the prediction network are copied to the target network. This leads to more stable training because it keeps the target function fixed (for a while):", "What does the above statement mean? Instead of running Q-learning on state/action pairs as they occur during simulation or the actual experience, the system stores the data discovered for [state, action, reward, next_state] \u2013 in a large table.", "Let\u2019s understand this using an example.", "Suppose we are trying to build a video game bot where each frame of the game represents a different state. During training, we could sample a random batch of 64 frames from the last 100,000 frames to train our network. This would get us a subset within which the correlation amongst the samples is low and will also provide better sampling efficiency.", "The concepts we have learned so far? They all combine to make the deep Q-learning algorithm that was used to achive human-level level performance in Atari games (using just the video frames of the game).", "I have listed the steps involved in a deep Q-network (DQN) below:", "Alright, so we have a solid grasp on the theoretical aspects of deep Q-learning. How about seeing it in action now? That\u2019s right \u2013 let\u2019s fire up our Python notebooks!", "We will make an agent that can play a game called CartPole.\u00a0We can also use an Atari game but training an agent to play that takes a while (from a few hours to a day). The idea behind our approach will remain the same so you can try this on an Atari game on your machine.", "CartPole is one of the simplest environments in the OpenAI gym (a game simulator). As you can see in the above animation, the goal of CartPole is to balance a pole that\u2019s connected with one joint on top of a moving cart.", "Instead of pixel information, there are four kinds of information given by the state (such as the angle of the pole and position of the cart). An agent can move the cart by performing a series of actions of 0 or 1, pushing the cart left or right.", "We will use the\u00a0keras-rl library here which lets us implement deep Q-learning out of the box.", "From the terminal, run the following code block:", "Assuming you have pip installed, you need to install the following libraries:", "First, we have to import the necessary modules:", "Next, we will build a very simple single hidden layer neural network model:", "Now, configure and compile our agent. We will set our policy as Epsilon Greedy and our memory as Sequential Memory because we want to store the result of actions we performed and the rewards we get for each action.", "This will be the output of our model:", "Not bad! Congratulations on building your very first deep Q-learning model. \ud83d\ude42", "OpenAI gym provides several environments fusing DQN on Atari games. Those who have worked with computer vision problems might intuitively understand this since the input for these are direct frames of the game at each time step, the model comprises of convolutional neural network based architecture.", "There are some more advanced Deep RL techniques, such as Double DQN Networks, Dueling DQN and Prioritized Experience replay which can further improve the learning process. These techniques give us better scores using an even lesser number of episodes. I will be covering these concepts in future articles.", "I encourage you to try the\u00a0DQN algorithm on at least 1 environment other than CartPole to practice and understand how you can tune the model to get the best results.", "IIT Bombay Graduate with a Masters and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering.\nI have previously worked as a lead decision scientist for Indian National Congress deploying statistical models (Segmentation, K-Nearest Neighbours) to help party leadership/Team make data-driven decisions.\nMy interest lies in putting data in heart of business for data-driven decision making.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
