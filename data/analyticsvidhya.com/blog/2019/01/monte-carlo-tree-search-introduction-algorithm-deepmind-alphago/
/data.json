Between 9 and 15 March, 2016, the second-highest ranked Go player, Lee Sidol, took on a computer program named AlphaGo.", "AlphaGo emphatically outplayed and outclassed Mr. Sidol and won the series 4-1. Designed by Google\u2019s DeepMind, the program has spawned many other developments in AI, including AlphaGo Zero. These breakthroughs are widely considered as stepping stones towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "In this article, I will introduce you to the algorithm at the heart of AlphaGo \u2013 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This algorithm has one main purpose \u2013 given the state of a game, choose the most promising move.", "To give you some context behind AlphaGo, we\u2019ll first briefly look at the history of game playing AI programs. Then, we\u2019ll see the components of AlphaGo, the Game Tree Concept, a few tree search algorithm, and finally dive into how the MCTS algorithm works.", "AI is a vast and complex field. But before AI officially became a recognized body of work, early pioneers in computer science wrote game-playing programs to test whether computers could solve human-intelligence level tasks.", "To give you a sense of where Game Playing AI started from and it\u2019s journey till date, I have put together the below key historical developments:", "And this is just skimming the surface! There are plenty of other examples where AI programs exceeded expectations. But this should give you a fair idea of where we stand today.", "The core parts of the Alpha Go comprise of:", "In this blog, we will\u00a0focus on the working of Monte Carlo Tree Search\u00a0only. This helps AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero smartly explore and reach interesting/good states in a finite time period which in turn helps the AI reach human level performance.", "It\u2019s application extends beyond games. MCTS can theoretically be applied to any domain that can be described in terms of {state,\u00a0action} pairs and simulation used to forecast outcomes. Don\u2019t worry if this sounds too complex right now, we\u2019ll break down all these concepts in this article.", "Game Trees are the most well known data structures that can represent a game. This concept is actually pretty straightforward.", "Each node of a game tree represents a particular state in a game. On performing a move, one makes a transition from a node to its children. The nomenclature is very similar to decision trees wherein the terminal nodes are called leaf nodes.", "For example, in the above tree, each move is equivalent to putting a cross at different positions. This branches into various other states where a zero is put at each position to generate new states. This process goes on until the leaf node is reached where the win-loss result becomes clear.", "Our primary objective behind designing these algorithms is to find best the path to follow in order to win the game. In other words, look/search for a way of traversing the tree that finds the best nodes to achieve victory.", "The majority of AI problems can be cast as search problems, which can be solved by finding the best plan, path, model or function.", "Tree search algorithms can be seen as building a search tree:", "The tree branches out because there are typically several different actions that can be taken in a given state. Tree search algorithms differ depending on which branches are explored and in what order.", "Let\u2019s discuss a few tree search algorithms.", "Uninformed Search algorithms, as the name suggests, search a state space without any further information about the goal. These are considered basic computer science algorithms rather than as a part of AI. Two basic algorithms that fall under this type of search are depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS). You can read more about them in this blog post.", "The Best First Search (BFS) method explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specific rule.\u00a0The defining characteristic of this search is that, unlike\u00a0DFS\u00a0or\u00a0BFS\u00a0(which blindly examine/expand a cell without knowing anything about it), BFS uses an evaluation function (sometimes called a \u201cheuristic\u201d) to determine which node is the most promising, and then examines this node.", "For example, A* algorithm keeps a list of \u201copen\u201d nodes which are next to an explored node. Note that these open nodes have not been explored. For each open node, an estimate of its distance from the goal is made. New nodes are chosen to explore based on the lowest cost basis, where the cost is the distance from the origin node plus the estimate of the distance to the goal.", "For single-player games, simple uninformed or informed search algorithms can be used to find a path to the optimal game state. What should we do for two-player adversarial\u00a0games where there is another player to account for? The actions of both players depend on each other.", "For these games, we rely on adversarial search. This includes the actions of two (or more) adversarial players. The basic adversarial search algorithm is called Minimax.", "This algorithm has been used very successfully for playing classic perfect-information two-player board games such as Checkers and Chess. In fact, it was (re)invented specifically for the purpose of building a chess-playing program.", "The core loop of the Minimax algorithm alternates between player 1 and player 2, quite like the white and black players in chess. These are called the min player and the max player. All possible moves are explored for each player.", "For each resulting state, all possible moves by the other player are also explored. This goes on until all possible move combinations have been tried out to the point where the game ends (with a win, loss or draw). The entire game tree is generated through this process, from the root node down to the leaves:", "Each node is explored to find the moves that give us the maximum value or score.", "Games like tic-tac-toe, checkers and chess can arguably be solved using the minimax algorithm. However, things can get a little tricky when there are a large number of potential actions to be taken at each state. This is because minimax explores all the nodes available. It can become frighteningly difficult to solve a complex game like Go in a finite amount of time.", "Go has a branching factor of approximately 300 i.e. from each state there are around 300 actions possible, whereas chess typically has around 30 actions to choose from. Further, the positional nature of Go, which is all about surrounding the adversary, makes it very hard to correctly estimate the value of a given board state. For more information on rules for Go, please refer this link.", "There are several other games with complex rules that minimax is ill-equipped to solve. These include Battleship Poker with imperfect information and non-deterministic games such as Backgammon and Monopoly. Monte Carlo Tree Search, invented in 2007, provides a possible solution.", "The basic MCTS algorithm is simple: a search tree is built, node-by-node, according to the outcomes of simulated playouts. The process can be broken down into the following steps:", "Before we delve deeper and understand tree traversal and node expansion, let\u2019s get familiar with a few terms.", "UCB1, or upper confidence bound for a node, is given by the following formula:", "What do we mean by a rollout? Until we reach the leaf node, we randomly choose an action at each step and simulate this action to receive an average reward when the game is over.", "Flowchart for Monte Carlo Tree Search", "You start with S0, which is the initial state. If the current node is not a leaf node, we calculate the values for UCB1 and choose the node that maximises the UCB value. We keep doing this until we reach the leaf node.", "Next, we ask how many times this leaf node was sampled. If it\u2019s never been sampled before, we simply do a rollout (instead of expanding). However, if it has been sampled before, then we add a new node (state) to the tree for each available action (which we are calling expansion here).", "Your current node is now this newly created node. We then do a rollout from this step.", "Let\u2019s do a complete walkthrough of the algorithm to truly ingrain this concept and understand it in a lucid manner.", "The way MCTS works is that we run it for a defined number of iterations or until we are out of time. This will tell us what is the best action at each step that one should take to get the maximum return.", "That is the gist of this algorithm. We can perform more iterations as long as required (or is computationally possible). The underlying idea is that\u00a0the estimate of values at each node becomes more accurate as the number of iterations keep increasing.", "Deepmind\u2019s AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero programs are far more complex with various other facets that are outside the scope of this article. However, the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm remains at the heart of it. MCTS plays the primary role in making complex games like Go easier to crack in a finite amount of time. Some open source implementations of MCTS are linked below:", "I expect reinforcement learning to make a lot of headway in 2019. It won\u2019t be surprising to see a lot more complex games being cracked by machines soon. This is a great time to learn reinforcement learning!", "I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions regarding this article and this algorithm in the comments section below. Have you used this algorithm before? If not, which game would you want to try it out on?", "IIT Bombay Graduate with a Masters and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering.\nI have previously worked as a lead decision scientist for Indian National Congress deploying statistical models (Segmentation, K-Nearest Neighbours) to help party leadership/Team make data-driven decisions.\nMy interest lies in putting data in heart of business for data-driven decision making.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
