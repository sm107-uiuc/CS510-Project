Will they finally blow the door wide open in 2019? What are some of the biggest obstacles holding back reinforcement learning? And is there a ceiling we can put on where RL will take us in the future?", "We welcome 2019 on DataHack Radio with a stellar episode #15 featuring Xander Steenbrugge, as he navigates us through the wide-ranging and intricate world of reinforcement learning. And yes, those above questions have been very expertly handled in this episode.", "Xander has a knack of taking the most complex topics and breaking them down into easy-to-understand concepts, a truly invaluable asset. I came across Xander thanks to his popular YouTube channel \u2018Arxiv Insights\u2019 and truly appreciated his presentation style when I saw him live at DataHack Summit 2018. His ability to explain challenging subjects is on full display in this episode as well.", "This article aims to highlight the key aspects discussed in this episode, including Xander\u2019s thoughts about reinforcement learning and related topics. I encourage you to listen to the full episode where Xander elaborates on his RL theories and ideas in much more detail. Happy listening!", "You can subscribe to DataHack Radio on any of the below platforms to receive notifications every time a new episode is published or to trawl through our archives:", "Xander pursued civil engineering from the University of Ghent, Belgium during his graduation. His entire education background was focused on electronics, such as making transistors, microcircuits, etc. He picked up coding with the aim of making the idea to execution phase much faster than it was when working purely with electronics.", "Not surprisingly, Xander\u2019s final thesis for his Master\u2019s degree (finished in 2015) was on\u00a0brain-computer interfaces that could perform brainwave (EEG) classification. You might have seen an application of this system on YouTube \u2013 when a patient puts on a headset wired with this mechanism, he/she can move the cursor on a connected computer screen with his/her thoughts.", "There was a ton of pre-processing work involved since the EEG signal data had a ton of noise. Once the data was cleaned, Xander performed manual feature extraction before feeding the data to a machine learning classifier. Neural networks were still in their relative infancy back when Xander was working on his project. Given the same data now, he would love to straightaway apply CNNs (convolutional neural networks) to the EEG signals. Fascinating stuff!", "Xander, working as a machine learning consultant, came across the 2015 paper by DeepMind where they introduced the DQN algorithm. The fact that you could play any kind of game with the same algorithm? That breakthrough really intrigued Xander and led him to explore this wonderfully complex field of reinforcement learning. Here\u2019s his take on this line of work at a very simplistic level:", "\u201cIt\u2019s not as difficult as it seems. It\u2019s supervised learning, but with a few tweaks.\u201d \u2013 Xander", "Is it really that simple, you ask? Here\u2019s a summary of Xander explaining his thought process by putting these two types of learning in contrast:", "The difference between supervised learning and reinforcement learning is that for RL, we have an agent that is moving around in an environment with the ability to take actions (like moving in a specific direction). This agent could be an algorithm, or a person, or an object. The action it takes affect the input that comes from the environment. Only once the agent is put through a few iterations can we tell how far away it is from achieving the end goal. When it comes to supervised learning, the input and output are already very well defined from the start.", "\u201cA reinforcement learning system can learn to do something that we as humans don\u2019t know how to do.\u201d \u2013 Xander", "It\u2019s no secret that progress in reinforcement learning has been slower than other domains. The idea to execution phase Xander referred to earlier takes a lot of time in RL. In academia, these agents are trained in simulations (like the ATARI game environment) because these algorithms are very \u201csample inefficient\u201d. In other words, we need to show these agent a whole host of examples before they learn something substantial.", "When we get to a real-world setting, that amount of data is more often than not sparse (as a lot of data scientists will relate to!). Additionally, we would need the algorithm to generalize to a different setting depending on what the requirement is. These are two major challenges that have held up reinforcement learning\u2019s penetration into commercial products and services.", "Having said that, Xander mentioned a really cool use case where reinforcement learning has successfully been applied \u2013 robotics farming. Listen to the podcast to understand the granular aspects of how this technology works.", "\u201cWe are at the start of a very big revolution, where we could go from hard-coded robots to smart learning robots.\u201d \u2013 Xander", "Another interesting nugget from the podcast \u2013 most of the research is still focused on single-agent reinforcement learning (in comparison to multi-agent RL) as there are still a plethora of problems left to solve there.", "Here are two major obstacles we face with the current state of reinforcement learning:", "Reinforcement learning is a huge field encompassing multiple topics and subjects. Right now, there\u2019s no one singular platform that offers you a straight path into this space. According to Xander, first understanding supervised learning from scratch is a good idea since reinforcement learning builds upon that foundation. So familiarize yourself with how an image classifier works before jumping into RL concepts.", "Xander\u2019s learning journey started from this blog post by Andrej Karpathy, called \u2018Pong from Pixels\u2019. It\u2019s a slightly lengthy read, but clearly illustrates how one can go from supervised learning to reinforcement learning. If you\u2019re looking for a more visually appealing guide, check out Xander\u2019s \u2018Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\u2019 video:", "Here\u2019s another excellent introduction to RL for beginners\u00a0by Faizan Shaikh. You should also check out OpenAI\u2019s educational resource on RL titled Spinning Up. It\u2019s a comprehensive list of resources and topics \u2013 it has personally been super helpful for me.", "A very pleasant and crisp introduction to reinforcement learning in under 50 minutes. I had very little idea about multi-agent reinforcement learning before this podcast so that was a really cool section for me. Xander\u2019s list of resources that I shared above is good enough to get your hands dirty so I hope to see a lot more of you from our community taking up RL in the near future.", "An exquisite podcast to kick off 2019. There\u2019s a lot more coming on DataHack Radio this year so keep your learning hats on and till then, happy listening!", "Senior Editor at Analytics Vidhya.\nData visualization practitioner who loves reading and delving deeper into the data science and machine learning arts.
