Learning paths take away the pain and confusion from the learning process. For those who don\u2019t know what a learning path is \u2013 we take the pain of going through all the resources available on data science, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, select the best ones, and arrange them in a logical sequence for you to follow.", "If this sounds like a lot of work \u2013 it is. And it is done with the purpose of eliminating that huge amount of work you would otherwise have to do. We understand that when you are starting out in data science, the sheer amount of resources can be overwhelming. And hence we created learning paths. And our learning paths were an instant success with our community.", "If learning paths were useful in 2018, this year they would be the most helpful tool for a person trying to become a data scientist. Why? Because the amount of content and information out there has increased multi-folds. And so has the confusion and the amount of knowledge expected out of a data scientist.", "Broadly, the learning path to become a data scientist can be divided into the following steps:", "We have broken down all these steps month on month \u2013 so if you start following the learning path, you know exactly what you need to follow and what you need to cover every month starting today.", "You can access the full learning path here and register yourself to start your journey today. Our training portal enables you to track your progress after each section thus helping you to stay on track throughout the year.", "Here is an image laying out what should you do month on month to become a data scientist by the end of 2019. If you put in all the efforts as mentioned in the learning path \u2013 you will be well placed to get into a data scientist role before the end of the year.", "We have one more gift to make your new year truly special. Join Analytics Vidhya\u2019s CEO and Founder Kunal Jain on January 10th for an exclusive webinar where he will elaborate on how to get the most out of this learning path.
