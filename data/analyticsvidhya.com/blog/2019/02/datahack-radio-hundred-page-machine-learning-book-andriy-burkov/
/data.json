You are not alone. A lot of people face this situation but do very little about it. Not Andriy Burkov! Andriy saw this and thought that the ideal Machine Learning book for beginners should be written within 100 pages.", "More importantly \u2013 he wrote the book and published it. His recently launched \u2018Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\u2018 has quickly ascended the bestseller list and is perched at #1 on Amazon (under the \u2018machine learning\u2019 category). The book has even been endorsed by the great Peter Norvig!", "It was our pleasure hosting him on episode #18 of DataHack Radio. Kunal and Andriy had a rich discussion on several topics, including:", "All DataHack Radio episodes are available on the below podcast platforms. Subscribe today!", "Andriy\u2019s professional career began in Ukraine at the turn of the millennium. He created his own online startup while doing his graduation in Computer Engineering and Networking. But after working on this for 3 years, the dotcom bubble burst and his investor decided to withdraw.", "Andriy wasn\u2019t about to give up on his dreams. The fire within him to build another online startup continued to burn bright. This wasn\u2019t possible in Ukraine back then though, given the economic situation. Attracting another investor was proving to be impossible.", "The first thought Andriy had was to move to Europe with his family. They considered France but eventually settled on Quebec, Canada. The primary reason was immigration purposes and Quebec seemed a good fit as it has a French dwelling community.", "Once in Canada, Andriy spent some time looking for jobs before finally settling on doing his Master\u2019s in computer science and artificial intelligence. He converted this into a Ph.D, choosing multi-agent systems as his primary topic. His thesis \u2013\u00a0Leveraging Repeated Games for Solving Complex Multi-agent Decision Problems.", "Want to see how much the field of AI has changed in the last decade? Here\u2019s an eye-opening anecdote Andriy told us:", "\u201cOne of my ex-colleagues, when he finished his Ph.D in Quebec City (several years before me), couldn\u2019t find a job in artificial intelligence. It was such an exotic field.\u201d", "It\u2019s mind-blowing how quickly technology changes our lives.", "Two paths opened up once Andriy finished his Ph.D \u2013 research or teaching. The former appealed to him far more than becoming a full-time professor. So he decided to dip his toes into an industry role with Fujitsu, a Japanese multinational company. He worked with Fujistsu for 2 years before moving on.", "From there, Andriy shifted to WANTED Technologies, a job announcement portal for companies. His role was primarily about turning terabytes of job announcements from online job boards into structured knowledge. An excellent experience that has played a big part in his professional career.", "That was followed by a move to a company that was acquired twice, the second time by Gartner. In Andriy\u2019s own words:", "There was an understandable seed of doubt \u2013 will working for such a huge organization stifle creativity? But Gartner\u2019s work culture soon put any doubts to rest.", "Andriy leads a team working on the research and development side of a product called Talent Neuron. It is a\u00a0portal that \u201ccombines big data and statistical insights to provide global talent, location and competitive intelligence for any industry or function\u201d.", "A quick glance at Andriy\u2019s LinkedIn profile tells us he is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) expert. That\u2019s a topic we at Analytics Vidhya are very passionate about. So picking Andriy\u2019s brains on NLP felt like a natural fit!", "His team\u2019s role at Gartner is geared more towards applied text analytics, rather than core computational linguistics. I have mentioned a few intriguing tasks the team works on (or has worked on):", "This is one of the most absorbing sections in this episode, especially for NLP enthusiasts. Andriy spoke about the complexities and nuances of language modeling with several examples. A must-listen!", "How did the idea of writing this book come about? It definitely wasn\u2019t the usual route! The thought hadn\u2019t even crossed Andriy\u2019s mind initially.", "There\u2019s a huge following on LinkedIn Andriy has built up over the years. He posts some superb stuff related to machine learning everyday (you should definitely give him a follow).", "\u201cI have a ton of machine learning and artificial intelligence books at home. But I never end up finishing any of them. I asked myself why?\u201d", "A huge reason for that is we\u2019ve become increasingly busy. We barely have time to finish a book, especially one that runs over 500 pages. He put his thoughts in a LinkedIn post, saying that if he ever wrote a book on machine learning, it wouldn\u2019t be more than 100 pages long.", "He had no intention of actually writing it though! The post went viral \u2013 hundreds of likes, tons of comments. The majority of comments could be divided into two categories:", "\u201cI took a week to think about it. I told myself \u2013 \u201cI will try to write several chapters. If it goes well, we\u2019ll see. If it doesn\u2019t go well, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\u201d", "The first three chapters were written over a weekend and the response? Overwhelmingly positive. And while the number of pages ran a shade above hundred, Andriy still managed to pack in all the fundamentals and essential knowledge a data scientist should have. A tremendous achievement!", "One of the most prominent things about the book is that it\u2019s available to read online for anyone. If you like it or found it useful, you should buy the paperback or hardcover edition. I really appreciate Andriy\u2019s thought process behind doing this.", "Given the crisp nature of the book, leaving certain concepts out was inevitable. But which ones? And to what degree? Those were critical questions Andriy addressed in this section.", "The idea, as we discussed earlier, was to include all the fundamentals, such as the mathematics behind core machine learning algorithms. So topics like reinforcement learning and back propagation were either not included or just brushed upon. A fair trade-off, in my opinion.", "Here\u2019s a brief summary of the key points Andriy spoke about:", "Just hearing Andriy talk about his book made me appreciate how hard the journey must have been. I have personally read the book and couldn\u2019t recommend it enough. It is a gem and will help thousands of aspiring data scientists make the leap into this field.", "Have you read the book yet?
