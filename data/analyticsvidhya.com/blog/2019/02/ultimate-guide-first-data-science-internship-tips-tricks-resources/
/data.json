This section looks at the key things you need to focus on and prepare for the interview.", "The ability to structure your thoughts is an invaluable skill in the complex world of data science. The interviewer will judge you on your ability to break down a problem statement into smaller steps. How you do that is where the goldmine lies.", "For any given problem statement, it is necessary to identify what the end goal is. The next step is to understand the data you\u2019re given and pen down a process required to get to that end goal. And all of this happens in a finite time frame (the interviewer does not have all day!). Are you seeing why it\u2019s so important to have a structured thinking mindset?", "To check your structured thinking skills, you would be given a question like \u2013 How many mails are being sent at the moment? That\u2019s what I was asked during my interview. Or how many red colored cars are on the road in Bangalore? How many cigarettes are sold in a day in India?", "For example, if I want to understand why charge offs have increased suddenly in credit card portfolio over the last month, I would lay it down in a structure similar to this:", "These are questions with no precise solution. So how do you go about solving them? The first thing to understand is that the interviewer does not expect an exact numerical answer. Instead, they are trying to understand how you look at the problem and your approach to getting the final answer. It\u2019s a good idea to ask for a pen and paper (or a whiteboard) so you can demonstrate your thinking step-by-step.", "I highly recommend going through this article \u2013 The Art of Structured Thinking and Analyzing. The piece explores everything you need to know about structured thinking and showcases a few examples to help you enhance your structured thinking skills.", "You might feel that this point isn\u2019t relevant to the discussion.

And who doesn\u2019t want to do that?!", "In this section, I have drawn on my own internship experience to give you a few additional tips and tricks to boost your chances of getting selected.", "Nothing will impress the interviewer more than watching you confidently answer advanced machine learning questions. Most folks they\u2019ll interview will be able to solve basic questions. Holding advanced ML knowledge will most definitely give you the edge.", "Make sure you have covered the basic machine learning topics first that we discussed earlier (stats, probability, regression, tree algorithms, etc.). You can then safely jump into the advanced ML algorithms, recommendation systems, time series forecasting algorithms, etc.", "At this stage in your career, i\u2019s not necessary to know ALL the algorithms in detail. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll 3-4 techniques that you find really helpful so learn them well \u2013 and rattle them off in your interview. You should have a fair understanding of the algorithm(s) and the math behind it. You can choose a particular field based on your interest and explore the various techniques in that domain.", "To give an example, if you are interested in time series, you start exploring the different forecasting techniques, the concept of stationarity or even pick a project on time series and work on it. Or if NLP is the field that interests you, you can work on understanding how features are extracted from text based data, what algorithms can be used on textual data and so on.", "Here are some important links to get you started:", "This adds a MASSIVE boost to your resume and increases your chances of getting the internship. Having worked on, or completed a project, is proof that your knowledge is not restricted to just books. You have clearly made an attempt to translate your theoretical learning to a real-world dataset \u2013 a sure-shot sign that your curiosity, passion and will to learn is quite high.", "To start with, I encourage you to participate in data science competitions. Start with the hackathons listed on AV\u2019s DataHack platform or on Kaggle. These platforms provide problem statements which mimic real-world scenarios, thus giving you an invaluable exposure to what life in the industry will feel like.", "You also get to compete with (and learn from) top data scientists from around the world.

That\u2019s exactly how you succeed in data science!", "In this section, I have penned down the major takeaways I experienced during my data science internship.", "You would be working on a real-life project during your internship. This is invaluable experience. Once you\u2019re on board, you might well find yourself entrenched in the end-to-end data science lifecycle, including defining the problem statement and building models.", "If you previously participated in data science competitions, you will have an idea about the different challenges data scientists come across. But here\u2019s the caveat.", "The problem statements and the datasets provided in these competitions are very different from real-world scenarios. The datasets are messy and unstructured in the industry. There\u2019s a ton of data cleaning work required before any model can be built.", "In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if 70-80% of your tasks involve data cleaning.", "You will learn how to structure a problem statement, understand the domain and the data required to solve the problem, and then figure out sources to extract that data. The next step is to get knee deep into research. Find out the approaches other data scientists have taken to solve similar problems.", "This will give you a fair idea about what should work well and what is not worth investing time on. While experiments are encouraged in data science, there\u2019s a limit to how much creative freedom you\u2019ll get from your manager. Filter out the aspects you know won\u2019t work beforehand.", "People often spend more time working on building a model than understanding the data. I myself used to do that for a long time. It was during my internship, while I was working with on a project when I realized how wrong my approach was. No", "I cannot stress enough how important it is to really understand the data you have. There are so many levels and hidden aspects in a dataset which we often overlook in our haste to build models. This is something you will learn during your internship (but should be prepared for beforehand).", "Spend as much time exploring the data as you can! Plot graphs, find patterns, and just dive into it like it\u2019s the best work in the world (because it is!). Try to understand the distribution, look for factors that affect your target variable and make inferences. Build a hypothesis, visualize data, find insights, and most importantly, discuss your findings with your teammates.", "One of the perks of a data science internship is working with incredibly smart and supportive people. Data science projects require collaboration and coordination among colleagues as you work towards the end goal. I consider myself lucky to be a part of such a great team.", "The best part about working in a team is that you always have someone to discuss your thoughts (and clarify your doubts). For instance, during my internship at Analytics Vidhya, we took part as a team in a huge hackathon. The dataset had multiple files, so we divided the task and each of us worked on understanding a particular file and shareed our knowledge with the rest of the team.", "I learned different approaches to tackle a problem and techniques to improve/optimize my code during those discussions. Working as a team would not only help you build your soft skills, but also hone your technical skills. A win-win combination!", "When you start your data science job search, you will most likely find that most companies ask for some experience in the domain. You should find out the kind of problems your company is working on, and think of ways in which you can contribute. Discuss your ideas with the people who are working on the project(s).", "You should also try to understand the roles of other people in the company. You can talk and discuss with people in different teams. For instance, talk to the marketing team and understand if you can perhaps think of a data drive solution to their problems. Make the most of the opportunity you have got. Be curious, ask relevant questions and learn from your team.", "I had a ball writing this article. There was so much I learned during my internship and this made me relive those moments. When I look back at that time, there was so much I didn\u2019t know.
