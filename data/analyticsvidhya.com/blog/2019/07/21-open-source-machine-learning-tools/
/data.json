The open-source community is massive and has an incredibly supportive attitude towards new tools and embracing the concept of democratizing machine learning.", "You must already know the popular open-source tools like R, Python, Jupyter notebooks, and so on.

These aren\u2019t as eminent as their counterparts but can be a lifesaver for many machine learning tasks.", "In this article, we will look at 21 such open-source tools for machine learning. I strongly encourage you to spend some time going through each category I have mentioned. There is a LOT to learn beyond what we typically learn in courses and videos.", "Note that many of these are Python-based libraries/tools because let\u2019s face it \u2013 Python is as versatile a programming language as we could get!", "Machine learning can appear complex to people coming from a non-programming and non-technical background. It\u2019s a vast field and I can imagine how daunting that first step can appear. Can a person with no programming experience ever succeed in machine learning?", "As it turns out, you can! Here are some tools that can help you cross the chasm and enter the famed machine learning world:", "There are a lot more interesting free and open-source software that provide great accessibility to do machine learning without writing (a lot of) code.", "On the other side of the coin, there are some paid out-of-the-box services you can consider, such as Google AutoML, Azure Studio, Deep Cognition, and Data Robot.", "Deploying machine learning models is one of the most overlooked yet important tasks you should be aware of.
