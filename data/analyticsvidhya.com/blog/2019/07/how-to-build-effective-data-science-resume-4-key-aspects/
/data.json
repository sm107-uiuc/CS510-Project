This is among the biggest gripes aspiring data science professionals have. Regardless of the role you\u2019re applying for (data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, etc.) \u2013 clearing that first hurdle is a significant obstacle.", "If you find yourself in a similar position, there\u2019s a good chance recruiters are passing over your resume. It is the single most important aspect of landing a data science interview. A poorly crafted resume or too many irrelevant details will land your resume in the rejection pile.", "Here\u2019s the good news \u2013 crafting the perfect data science resume is a skill you can learn! Once you know how to expertly update your resume, you\u2019ll be able to effectively market your skills when applying for your next data science job.", "Now, I will take you through a step-by-step process to build an awesome data science resume. If you follow this process sincerely, there\u2019s a good chance your resume would leave a good impression on potential recruiters.", "If you\u2019re struggling to land or clear data science interviews, we have curated the perfect course for you. The \u2018Ace Data Science Interviews\u2018 course is an amalgamation of our combined experience of taking hundreds of interviews to help you land your dream data science role.", "This is a very intuitive way of crafting your resume. Let me explain. In any house, you have a fixed area and a floor plan to work with. You need to make sure that things fit in neatly in whatever space that is available to you.", "Similarly, your resume has limited space which you should use judiciously and tell your story effectively.", "Keep this analogy in mind as we walk through the steps below.", "First, we should consider the overall structure of the resume. This will help us plan the different sections we should include and how lengthy (or short) those sections should be.", "While building a resume, one of the most common dilemmas is what should be the length of the resume? Ideally, a single page is sufficient. If you keep your resume crisp and to the point, it would ensure that the interviewer/recruiter is reading what you want them to read.", "A one page resume is recommended, while a two page one is also acceptable. Anything beyond two pages increases the chances of getting your resume rejected. In my experience, crafting a multiple page resume is usually skimmed over by the recruiter \u2013 not an ideal situation to be in.", "Have a look at the below resume. It stretches all the way up to 3 pages. This is highly undesirable and it would leave a bad impression on the recruiter or the interviewer:", "Now, take a look at the below resume. It\u2019s exactly what a data science recruiter would look for. It becomes really easy to skim through it and get an idea about your skills and capabilities. And given that recruiters are parsing through hundreds of resumes a week \u2013 this is what they keep an eye out for.", "So, try to keep only the relevant information on your resume. For example, if you\u2019re applying for an NLP role, there isn\u2019t much need of mentioning how you took accounts as a subject back in college. Space is absolutely vital \u2013 use it wisely.", "But what if all you\u2019ve achieved and done is simply too much for a single page? Here\u2019s my advice \u2013 do not hesitate to cut down the content and keep only those details that would be in-line with the job you are applying to.", "Once you have selected the information that you would like to display on your resume, it is time to identify the right sections or areas on the resume where you would put your experience and information.", "Here are a few key points you should consider while preparing your data science resume:", "Here comes the meat of your resume \u2013 your experience and projects in data science. Again, your ability to fit everything into a single page will come in handy. But how can you do that? Let\u2019s take a look!", "Let\u2019s pay attention to what you should put in each of the sections discussed above. This exercise is crucial because you want to tell as much about yourself as possible without including any irrelevant information. On top of that, due to space constraints on the resume, you might even have to sacrifice some of your relevant and important information.", "Hence, prioritising what to display and what not to on the resume is a critical step. It depends not just on your knowledge and work experience but also on the nature of the job you wish to apply for.", "For example, let\u2019s say you have worked on a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem and you go ahead and apply for an NLP Data Scientist role. However, most of the projects mentioned in your resume are related to basic machine learning challenges. This will be a very risky scenario for you as the recruiter might well reject your resume because he would not come to know that you can even handle NLP tasks.", "I completely understand that it\u2019s difficult to leave information out. But that\u2019s the price we have to pay when we want to land our dream role. So, let\u2019s see what kind of information we should include and what to exclude in different sections of the resume:", "Awesome! The basic template of your resume is ready. So, what\u2019s next? Your resume should pack a punch so let\u2019s see how to make it impactful.", "To make your resume stand out from the rest of the candidates, incorporate the below points I\u2019ve mentioned:", "Now that your resume is all done and ready, there is still one final step left for you to execute \u2013 getting practical and experienced feedback on your resume. This is important because when we work on something with full dedication and sincerity, we often tend to overlook its flaws and drawbacks. It is a human tendency. The only way to rectify this problem is by getting your work reviewed by the right people.", "For example, at Analytics Vidhya, once I have written a blog article on a project, I get it cross-checked and reviewed by my teammates. This adds a fresh perspective to my thoughts and the feedback that I receive helps me a lot in further improving the article for the community.", "Hence, to build a solid data science resume, it is imperative to get it reviewed by industry experts, data scientists, subject matter experts, etc. This is where your networking skills would be useful. Share your resume with the people in the industry and take their feedback. ", "Ask specific questions to these people. For example, you can ask which three out of five of your projects should be there on your resume. Or how you can quantify a certain task you performed in college or in a previous organization.\n", "We have so far seen the essential ingredients to build a great data science resume. However, in today\u2019s world, having a good resume alone might not be enough to land that coveted interview call. Especially if you are applying for the Data Scientist role.", "Your resume should be supplemented with your digital profile as well.", "We are living and thriving in the midst of a digital revolution. It stands to reason that the recruiting process would incorporate that as well, right?", "Let me give you my example. I take quite a few data science interviews every week. Before I get on the call or enter the interview room, I always check two things:", "I additionally look at the projects mentioned on both these platforms. Are the projects relevant to the current role? This helps me visualize the candidate\u2019s profile so I can structure my questions in a certain manner. I can also gauge whether the skills mentioned by the candidate in his/her resume are reflecting in their GitHub profile.", "To build an impressive and powerful digital profile, you can take cues from the following ideas:", "This is not an exhaustive list. There could be other means and tools as well to enhance your digital presence. However, keep in mind that you are building this digital profile to make sure that when you go for your interviews, it should reflect your expertise.", "It is also not feasible to maintain your profile at every major platform. Therefore, you have to be selective when it comes to shaping up your digital profile.\u00a0", "But let\u2019s settle this now \u2013 LinkedIn and GitHub profiles are mandatory to have. Absolutely no question around that. Apart from these two, you can have a presence on blogs, podcasts, or YouTube as well (but these are good to have profile rather than mandatory ones).", "This article should be a good starting point for your data science job application process. As I mentioned earlier, having a solid, relevant and impactful resume is mandatory if you want to land that dream data science job.", "But this is one step in the entire data science interview process. There are multiple rounds you should be aware of (and be prepared for), such as:", "And so on. We\u2019ve covered each of these steps in our comprehensive \u2018Ace Data Science Interviews\u2018 course. The course has several handouts as well to supplement your learning including a comprehensive interview guide with over 240 questions.
