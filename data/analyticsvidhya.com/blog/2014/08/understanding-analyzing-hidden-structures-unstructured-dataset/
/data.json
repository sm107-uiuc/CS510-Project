In this article we will talk in more details to understand the data structure and clean unstructured text to make it usable for the modelling exercise. We will be using the same business problem as discussed in last article to understand these procedures.", "You are the owner of Metrro cash n carry. Metrro has a tie up with Barcllays bank to launch co-branded cards. Metrro and Barcllay have recently entered into an agreement to share transactions data. Barcllays will share all transaction data done on their credit card on any retail store. Metrro will share all transaction done by any credit card on their stores. You wish to use this data to track where are your high value customers shopping other than Metrro.", "To do this you need to fetch out information from the free transactions text available on Barcllays transaction data. For instance, a transaction with free text \u201cPayment made to Messy\u201d should be tagged as transaction made to the retail store \u201cMessy\u201d. Once we have the tags of retail store and the frequency of transactions at these stores for Metrro high value customers, you can analyze the reason of this customer outflow by comparing services between Metrro and the other retail store.", "Let us first look at the raw data to build a framework for data cleaning. Following are sample transactions on which we need to work on :", "Let us observe the data carefully to understand what information can be derived out of this data set.", "Cleaning text data on R is extremely easy. For this analysis we will not be using the numbers at the end of the transactions. But in case you are to make a strong analysis, this is something you should definitely explore. In this dataset, we need to make following adjustments :", "Given our understanding of data, step 2& 5\u00a0 , 3 & 4 can be combined to avoid extra efforts. In step 2, we simply need to remove a single character \u201c#\u201d, which is automatically done in R while removing other punctuations . We will combine the words in step 3 and step 4, and remove them together. You can use the following code to clean the data set. Once we have the clean data set, we will convert it into a term document matrix. You can use the following codes for this exercise :", "Cleaning data sets is a very crucial step in any kind of data mining. However, it is many times more important while dealing with unstructured data sets. Understanding the data and cleaning the data consumes the maximum time of any text mining analysis. In the next article we will talk about creating a dictionary manually. This becomes important when we are doing a niche analysis for which ready made dictionary is either not available or very expensive.", "Have you done text mining before? If you did, what other cleaning steps did you leverage? What tool do you think is most suitable for doing a niche kind of text mining like transactions analysis or behavioral analysis? Did you find the article useful? Did this article solve any of your existing dilemma?", "Tavish Srivastava, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Analytics Vidhya, is an IIT Madras graduate and a passionate data-science professional with 8+ years of diverse experience in markets including the US, India and Singapore, domains including Digital Acquisitions, Customer Servicing and Customer Management, and industry including Retail Banking, Credit Cards and Insurance.
