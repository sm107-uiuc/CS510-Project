One such algorithm is \u201cRandom Forest\u201d, which we will discuss in this article. While the algorithm is very popular in various competitions (e.g. like the ones running on Kaggle), the end output of the model is like a black box and hence should be used judiciously.", "Before going any further, here is an example\u00a0on the importance of choosing the best algorithm.", "Yesterday, I saw a movie called \u201d Edge of tomorrow\u201c. \u00a0I loved the concept and the thought process which went behind the plot of this movie. Let me summarize the plot (without commenting on the climax, of course). Unlike other sci-fi movies, this movie revolves around\u00a0one single power which is given to both the sides (hero and villain). The power being the ability to reset the day.", "Human race is at war with an alien species called \u201cMimics\u201d. \u00a0Mimic is\u00a0described as a far more evolved civilization of an alien species. Entire Mimic civilization\u00a0is like a single complete organism. It has a central brain called \u201cOmega\u201d which commands all other organisms in the civilization. It stays in contact with all other species of the civilization every single second. \u201cAlpha\u201d is the main warrior species (like the nervous system) of this civilization and takes command from \u201cOmega\u201d. \u201cOmega\u201d has the power to reset the day at any point of time.", "Now, let\u2019s wear the hat of a predictive analyst to analyze this plot. If a system has the ability to reset the day at any point of time, it will use this power, whenever any of its warrior species die. And, hence there will be no single war ,when any of the warrior species (alpha) will actually die, and the brain \u201cOmega\u201d will repeatedly test the best case scenario to maximize the death of human race and put a constraint on number of deaths of alpha (warrior species) to be zero every single day. You can imagine this as \u201cTHE BEST\u201d predictive algorithm ever made.

Say, we have 1000 observation in the complete population with 10 variables. Random forest tries to build multiple CART models with different samples and different initial variables. For instance, it will take a random sample of 100 observation and 5 randomly chosen initial variables to build a CART model. It will repeat the process (say) 10 times and then make a final prediction on each observation. Final prediction is a function of each prediction. This final prediction can simply be the mean of each prediction.", "Disclaimer : The numbers in this article are illustrative", "Mexico has a population of 118 MM. Say, the algorithm Random forest picks up 10k observation with only one variable (for simplicity) to build each CART model.

For simplicity, we will just take a mean of probabilities in this case study. Other than simple mean, we also consider vote method to come up with the final prediction.

As you can see from this analysis, that there is 70% chance of this individual falling in class 1 (less than $40,000) and around 24% chance of the individual falling in class 2.", "Random forest gives much more\u00a0accurate predictions when compared to simple CART/CHAID or regression models in many scenarios. These cases generally have high number of predictive variables and huge sample size. This is because it captures the variance of several input variables at the same time and enables high number of observations to participate in the prediction.
