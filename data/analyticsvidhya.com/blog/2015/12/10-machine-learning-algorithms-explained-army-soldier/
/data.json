Ruthless war. Don\u2019t you believe me?", "Consider the data set as your opponent. Your knowledge of data mining & ml algorithms as your weapons. Your win will depend on\u00a0the\u00a0intuitive usage of your knowledge & strategy to get highest accuracy. So, how many times have you won this battle?", "I realized it last week. While travelling to south, I met a person whose daughter is a data scientist. That\u2019s all he knew when I asked him about his kid\u2019s profession. He didn\u2019t get much time to spent with his daughter. He was a soldier.", "He inquired about me too.\u00a0His eyes glowed with ecstasy when he found out that I\u2019m also a data scientist. He inquired further. Precisely, he was curious to know about ML\u00a0Algorithms. It\u2019s a lot being used in defense these days, he said.", "This was a tough task for me. I\u00a0didn\u2019t know how to explain the technical stuff to a soldier. I found out a way. I knew\u00a0he would surely understand\u00a0things about battle, warfare, strategy. I explained him machine learning in these terms. In the end, he was convinced that his daughter has landed herself\u00a0into a challenging job. He felt proud.", "In this article, I\u2019ve revealed that approach used to explain ML\u00a0algorithms to the soldier. Though, there would be less soldiers who would read this, yet this idea promotes an interesting way of learning. This would surely help beginners who are struggling to understand these algorithms. I\u2019ve also added images to help you visualize the situation and learn.", "Note: The objective of this article is to help people learn machine learning in a fun and interesting way. You\u2019ll also notice every algorithm has its own special situation where it is used.", "Supervised Learning : You go on a war and don\u2019t stop until you kill\u00a0all your enemies whoever comes your way. It include algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.", "Unsupervised Learning :\u00a0Your rival has challenged you for a war. Now, you decide after assessing your strengths and weakness, whether to accept the challenge or surrender. It include algorithms such as k-means, apriori etc", "Reinforcement Learning\u00a0: You\u2019ve accepted the challenge. The war has begun. After every hour, you are accessing your position in the battle. Are you loosing more men? Is the opponent dominating? And, accordingly you decide where to continue or surrender. It includes algorithm such as markov decision process.", "These algorithms are nothing but the weapons used to fight data sets. Make sure you learn them well to build your armory. Look, I\u2019ve 10 weapons in my armory. How many have you got?", "Let\u2019s see my way of explaining these algorithms to the soldier. You can also view the below video that gives you a quick overview of these techniques!", "Linear Regression is completely taking over your opposition. Once you\u2019ve entered the battle ground, don\u2019t look back. Only take rest, once you\u2019ve satisfactorily killed all your enemies.", "Logistic Regression is taking simplistic assumptions and then deciding whether to go on a war or not.", "This includes Decision Trees, Random Forest. Tree Based Modeling is simply Divide and Rule. You divide your opponents with some smart strategy and kill them.", "Bayesian Modeling is considering your\u00a0probability of winning in different battle base types such as air battle, land battle, water battle. And, accordingly take the overall decision of battle.", "SVM is drawing out territory and boundary where you\u2019ve advantage on field base. For example, your soldiers might be adept to fighting in specific areas such as desert / mountain / fields and declare the war accordingly.", "kNN is checking past outcomes and mapping accordingly. Evaluate your performance in past battles, contemplate on your weak and strong areas and prepare for the next battle accordingly.", "k-means is building up alliances (groups) with\u00a0provinces which share the same philosophy, goals and motives. The idea is to become more powerful than ever before.", "Neural Network is every soldier in your army decides whom to fight. Imagine, the situation arising when soldiers run towards enemy soldiers and instantly decide which soldier to fight. Naturally, every soldier would prefer to fight a weaker enemy soldier (watch and analyze) so that he can kill as\u00a0many quickly. Overall, this strategy would impact the performance of whole army.", "Ensemble Modeling is when an army consists of men skilled in various combats such as archery, knife fighting, swordsmen, shooting etc which shares a common motive of \u2018victory over enemies\u2019. \u00a0All these men together would result in a formidable army.", "Anomaly Detection is checking for unusual patterns in your own army. You may have a secret agent among your soldier brothers. Keep your periodic checks on.", "I hope now you understand these algorithms well. This is how I helped that soldier to understand these algorithms. I believe, the most difficult things in nature, do have a simple explanation to offer. We just need to start relating this around us. As I just did. People new to machine learning, would now find them easier to remember and apply these algorithms.", "In this article, I\u2019ve explained machine learning algorithms to a soldier in terms of war, battle, and strategy.\u00a0Do you find watching battle, wars interesting? If yes, you would surely find an interest here.", "Did you find it useful ? Do share your opinions / suggestions in the comments section below.
