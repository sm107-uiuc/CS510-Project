After all, \u2018 Good Things Happen When You Expect Them Least To Happen\u2019. It all started with the end of Black Friday Data Hack. Out of 1200 participants, we got our winners and their interesting solutions.", "I read and analyzed them. I realized that I had missed\u00a0on an incredible machine learning tool. A quick exploration told me that this tool has immense potential to reduce our machine learning modeling pains. So, I decided to explore it further. I now have dedicated a few days to understand its science and logical methods of usage. To my surprise, it wasn\u2019t difficult to understand.", "Were you trying to improve your Machine Learning model ? But failed mostly? Try this advanced machine learning tool. A month trial is free and 1 year subscription is available for FREE for academic use. Then, you can purchase subscription for following years.", "To get you started quickly, here is a beginners guide on GraphLab in Python. For ease of understanding, I\u2019ve tried to explain these concepts in simplest possible manner.", "GraphLab has an interesting story of its inception. Let me tell you in brief.", "GraphLab, known as Dato is founded by Carlos Guestrin. Carlos holds Ph.D in Computer Science from Stanford University. \u00a0It happened around 7 years back. Carlos was a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Two of his students were working on large scale distributed machine learning algorithms. They ran their model on top of Hadoop and found it took quite long to compute. Situations didn\u2019t even improve after using MPI (high performance computing library).", "So, they decided to build a system to write more papers quickly. With this, GraphLab came into existence.", "P.S \u2013 GraphLab Create is a commercial software by GraphLab.\u00a0GraphLab Create is\u00a0accessed in python using\u00a0\u201cgraphlab\u201d library. Hence, in this article, \u2018GraphLab\u2019 connotes GraphLab Create. Don\u2019t get confused.", "GraphLab is a new parallel framework for machine learning written in C++. It is an open source project\u00a0and\u00a0has been designed considering the scale, variety and complexity of real world data. It incorporates various high level algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gradient Descent & Locking to deliver high performance experience. It helps data scientists and developers easily create and install applications at large scale.", "But, what makes it amazing? \u00a0It\u2019s the presence of neat libraries for data transformation, manipulation and model visualization. In addition, it comprises of scalable machine learning toolkits which has everything (almost) required to improve machine learning models. The toolkit includes implementation for deep learning, factor machines, topic modeling, clustering, nearest neighbors and more.", "Here is the complete architecture of GraphLab Create.", "There are multiple benefits of using GraphLab as described below:", "You can also use GraphLab once you have availed its license. However,\u00a0you can also get started with free trial\u00a0or the academic edition with 1 year subscription. So, prior to\u00a0installation, your machine\u00a0must\u00a0fulfill the system requirement to run GraphLab.", "If your system fails to\u00a0meet above requirement, you can use GraphLab Create on the AWS Free Tier\u00a0also.\u00a0", "After you\u2019ve installed\u00a0GraphLab successfully, you can access it using \u201cimport <library_name>\u201d.", "Here, I\u2019ll demonstrate the use of\u00a0GraphLab by solving\u00a0\u00a0a data science challenge. I have the taken data set\u00a0from Black Friday Data Hack.", "Now, look at the pre and post visualization of variable \u201cAge\u201d.\nFor more details on Data Manipulation using GraphLab, please refer this link.", "Finally, you can take this input variable to original data set.", "Similarly, you can apply other feature engineering operations to the data set based on your requirement. You can refer this link for more details.", "In Black Friday challenge, we are required\u00a0predict the numeric quantities \u201cPurchase\u201d i.e. we need a regression model to predict the \u201cPurchase\u201d.", "In GraphLab, we have three type of regression models:\nA) Linear Regression\nB) Random Forest Regression\nC) Gradient Boosted Regression\nIf you have any confusion in algorithm selection, GraphLab takes care of that. Don\u2019t worry. It selects the right regression model automatically.", "To know more about other modeling techniques like clustering, classification, recommendation system, Text analysis, \u00a0Graph Analysis, Recommendation Systems you can refer this\u00a0link. Alternatively, here is the complete user guide by Dato.", "In this article, \u00a0we learnt about \u201cGraphLab Create\u201d which helps to handle large data set while building machine learning models. We also looked at the data structure of Graphlab\u00a0which\u00a0enables it to handle large data set like \u201cSFrame\u201d and \u201cSGraph\u201d. I\u2019d recommend you to use GraphLab. You\u2019d love its\u00a0automated features like\u00a0data exploration (Canvas, interactive web data exploration tool), feature engineering, \u00a0selecting the right models and deployment.", "For better understanding, I\u2019ve also\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0a modeling exercise using GraphLab. \u00a0In my next article on GraphLab, I will focus on Graph Analysis and Recommendation System.\n", "Did you find this article helpful ?
