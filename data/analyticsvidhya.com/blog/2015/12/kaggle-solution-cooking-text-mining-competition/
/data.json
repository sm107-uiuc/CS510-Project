At first, I was intrigued by its name. I checked it and realized that\u00a0this competition is about to finish. My bad! It was\u00a0a text mining competition. \u00a0This competition went live for 103 days and ended on 20th December 2015.", "Still, I decided to test my skills. I downloaded the data set, built a model and managed to get a score of 0.79817 in the end. Even though, my submission wasn\u2019t accepted after the competition got over,\u00a0but I could check my score. This got me in top 20 percentile.", "I used Text Mining, XGBoost and Ensemble Modeling to get this score. And, I used R. It took me less than 6 hours to achieve this milestone.\u00a0I teamed up with\u00a0Rohit Hinduja,\u00a0who is currently interning at Analytics Vidhya.", "To help beginners in R, here is\u00a0my solution in a tutorial format. In the article below, I\u2019ve adapted a step by step methodology to explain the solution. This tutorial requires prior knowledge of R and Machine Learning.", "I am confident that this tutorial can improve your R coding skills and approaches.", "Here\u2019s a quick approach to (for beginners) give a tough fight in any kaggle competition:", "Yeah! I could smell, it was a text mining competition. The data set had a list of id, ingredients and cuisine. There were 20 types of cuisine in the data set. The participants were asked to predict a cuisine based on available ingredients.", "The ingredients were available in the form of a text list. That\u2019s where text mining was\u00a0used. Before reaching to the modeling stage, I cleaned the text using\u00a0pre-processing methods. And, finally with available set of variables, I used an ensemble of XGBoost Models.", "Note: My system configuration is core i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 1TB Hard Disk.\u00a0", "Below is the my solution of this competition:", "Though many people don\u2019t believe in this, but this step do\u00a0wonders when\u00a0done intuitively. Hypothesis Generation\u00a0can help you to think \u2018out of data\u2019. It also helps you understand the data and relationship between the variables. It should ideally be done after you\u2019ve looked at problem statement (but not the data).", "Before exploring data, you must think smartly\u00a0on the problem statement. What could be the features which can influence your outcome variable? Think on these terms and write down your findings. I did the same. Below is my list of findings which I thought could help me in determining a cuisine:", "The data set shows a list of id, cuisine and ingredients\u00a0. The data set is available in json format.\u00a0The dependent variable is cuisine. The independent variable is ingredients. Train data set is used for creating model. Test data is used to checking the accuracy of the model. If you are still confused between the two, remember, test data set do not have dependent variable.", "Since the data is available in text format, I was determined to quickly build a corpus of ingredients (next step).\u00a0Here is a snapshot of data set for your perusal in json format:", "For this solution, I\u2019ve used R (precisely R Studio\u00a00.99.484) in Windows environment.", "Text Mining / Natural Language Processing helps computers to understand text and derive useful information from it. Several brands use this technique to analyse customer sentiments on social media. It\u00a0consists of pre-defined set of commands used to clean the data. Since, text mining is mainly used to verify sentiments, the incoming data can\u00a0be loosely structured, multilingual, textual or might have poor spellings.", "Some of the commonly used techniques in text mining are:", "I\u2019ve used these techniques in my solution too.", "Since the data set is in json format, I require different set of libraries to perform this step. jsonlite offers an easy way to import data in R. This is how I\u2019ve done:", "1. Import Train and Test Data Set", "2. Combine both train and test data set. This\u00a0will make our text cleaning process less painful. If I do not combine, I\u2019ll have to clean train and test data set separately. And, this would take a\u00a0lot of time.", "But\u00a0I need to add the dependent variable in test data set. Data can be combine using rbind (row-bind) function.", "As explained above, here are the steps used to clean the list of ingredients. I\u2019ve used tm package for text mining.", "1. Create a Corpus of Ingredients (Text)", "6. After we are done with pre-processing, it is necessary to convert the text into plain text document. This helps in pre-processing documents as text documents.", "7. For further processing, we\u2019ll create a document matrix where the text will categorized in columns", "1. Computing frequency column wise to get the ingredient with highest frequency", "We see that, there are may terms (ingredients) which occurs once, twice or thrice. Such ingredients won\u2019t add any value to the model. However, we need to be sure about removing these ingredients as it might cause loss in data. Hence, I\u2019ll remove only the\u00a0terms having frequency less than 3", "2. Let\u2019s visualize the data now. But first,\u00a0we\u2019ll create a data frame.", "Here we see that salt, oil, pepper are among the highest occurring ingredients.\u00a0You can change the freq values (in graph above) to visualize the frequency of ingredients.", "3. We can also find the level of correlation between two ingredients. For example, if you have any ingredient in mind which can be highly correlated with others, we can find it. Here I am checking the correlation of salt and oil with other variables. I\u2019ve assigned the correlation limit as 0.30. It means, I\u2019ll only get the value which have correlation higher than 0.30.", "4. We can also create a word cloud to check the most frequent terms. It is easy to build and gives an enhanced understanding of ingredients in this data. For this, I\u2019ve used the package \u2018wordcloud\u2019.", "5. Now I\u2019ll make final structural changes in the data.", "Here I find that, \u2018italian\u2019 is the most popular in\u00a0all the cuisine available. Using this information,\u00a0I\u2019ve added the\u00a0dependent variable \u2018cuisine\u2019 in the data frame newsparse as \u2018italian\u2019.", "As my first attempt, I couldn\u2019t think of any algorithm better than naive bayes. Since I have a multi class categorical variable, I expected naive bayes to do wonders. But, to my surprise, the naive bayes model went in\u00a0perpetuity. Perhaps, my machine specifications aren\u2019t powerful enough.", "Next, I tried Boosting. Thankfully, the model computed\u00a0without any trouble.\u00a0Boosting is a technique\u00a0which convert weak learners into strong learners. In simple terms, I built three XGBoost model. All there were weak, means their accuracy weren\u2019t good. I combined (ensemble) the predictions\u00a0of three model to produce a strong model. \u00a0To know more about boosting, you can refer to this introduction.", "The reason I used boosting is because, it works great on sparse matrices. Since, I\u2019ve a sparse matrix here, I expected it to give good results.\u00a0Sparse Matrix is a matrix which has large number of zeroes in it. It\u2019s opposite is dense matrix. In a dense matrix, we have very few zeroes. XGBoost, precisely, deliver exceptional results\u00a0on sparse matrices.", "I did parameter tuning on XGBoost model to ensure that every model behaves in a different way. To read more on XGBoost, here\u2019s a comprehensive documentation: XGBoost", "Below is my complete code. I\u2019ve used the packages xgboost and matrix. The package \u2018matrix\u2019 is used to create sparse matrix quickly.", "Now, I\u2019ve created a sparse matrix using xgb.DMatrix of train data set. I\u2019ve kept the set of independent variables and removed the dependent variable.", "I\u2019ve created a sparse matrix for test data set too. This is done to create a watchlist. Watchlist is a list of sparse form of train and test data set. It is served as an parameter in xgboost model to provide train and test error as the model runs.", "To understand the modeling part, I suggest you to read this document. I\u2019ve built 3 just models with different parameters . You can even create 40 \u2013 50 models for ensembling. In the code below, I\u2019ve\u00a0used\u00a0\u2018Objective = multi:softmax\u2019. Because, this is a case of multi classification.", "Among other parameters, eta, min_child_weight, max.depth and gamma directly controls the model complexity. These parameters prevents the model to overfit.\u00a0The model will be more conservative, if these values are chosen larger.", "Now I have three weak learners. You can check their accuracy using:", "The simple key is ensemble. Now, I have three data frame for model predict, predict2 and predict 3. I\u2019ve now extracted the \u2018cuisine\u2019 column from predict and predict 2 into predict 3. With this step, I get all values of \u2018cuisines\u2019 in one data frame. Now I can easily ensemble their predictions", "I\u2019ve used the\u00a0MODE function to extract the predicted value with highest frequency per id.", "After following the step mentioned above, you can easily get the same score as mine (0.798). You would have seen, I haven\u2019t used any brainy method to improve this model. i just applied my basics. Since I\u2019ve just started, I would like to see if I can push this further the highest level now.", "With this, I finish this tutorial for now! There are many things in this data set which you can try at your end. Due to time constraints, I couldn\u2019t spent much time on it during the competition. But, it\u2019s time you put on your thinking boots. I failed at Naive Bayes. So, why don\u2019t you create an ensemble of naive bayes models? or may be, create a cluster of ingredients and build a model over it ?", "I\u2019m sure this strategy might give you a better score. Perhaps, more knowledge. In this tutorial, I\u2019ve built a predictive model on What\u2019s Cooking ? data set hosted by Kaggle. I took a step wise approach to cover various stages of model building. I used text mining and ensemble of 3 XGBoost models. XGBoost in itself is a deep topic. I plan to cover it deeply in my forthcoming articles. I\u2019d suggest you to practice and learn.", "Did you find the article useful? Share with us if you have done similar kind of analysis before.
