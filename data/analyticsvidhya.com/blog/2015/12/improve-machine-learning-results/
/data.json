Despite trying all the strategies and algorithms you\u2019ve learned, you tend to fail at improving the accuracy of your model. You feel helpless and stuck. And this is where 90% of the data scientists give up. The remaining 10% is what differentiates a master data scientist from an average data scientist. This article covers 8 proven ways to re-structure your model approach to improve its accuracy.", "A predictive model can be built in many ways. There is no \u2018must-follow\u2019 rule. But, if you follow my ways (shared below), you\u2019ll surely achieve\u00a0high accuracy in your models (given that the data provided is sufficient to make predictions). I\u2019ve learned these methods with experience. I\u2019ve always preferred to know about these learning techniques practically than digging into theories. In this article, I\u2019ve shared some of the best ways to create a robust python, machine-learning model. I hope my knowledge can help people achieve great heights in their careers.", "The model development cycle goes through various stages, starting from data collection to model building. But, before exploring the data to understand relationships (in variables), It\u2019s always recommended to perform hypothesis generation (To know more about hypothesis generation, refer to\u00a0this link). I believe this is the most underrated step of predictive modeling.", "It is important that you spend time thinking about the given problem and gaining domain knowledge. So, how does it help? This practice usually helps in\u00a0building better features later on, which are not biased by the data available in the dataset. This is a crucial step\u00a0that usually\u00a0improves a\u00a0model\u2019s accuracy.", "At this stage, you are expected to apply\u00a0structured thinking to the problem, i.e., a thinking process that takes into consideration all the possible aspects of a particular problem.", "Let\u2019s dig deeper now.\u00a0Now we\u2019ll\u00a0check out the proven way to improve the accuracy of a model:", "Having more data is always a good idea. It allows the \u201cdata to tell for itself\u201d instead of relying on assumptions and weak correlations. Presence of more data results in\u00a0better and more accurate machine-learning models.", "I understand we don\u2019t get an\u00a0option to add more data. For example, we do not get a choice\u00a0to increase the size of training data in data science competitions. But while working on a real-world company project, I suggest you ask for more data, if possible. This will reduce the pain of working on limited data sets.", "The unwanted presence of missing and outlier values\u00a0in the training data often reduces the accuracy\u00a0of a trained model or leads to\u00a0a biased model. It leads to inaccurate\u00a0predictions. This is because\u00a0we don\u2019t\u00a0analyze the behavior and relationship with other variables correctly. So, it is important to treat missing and outlier values well.", "Look at the below test data snapshot carefully. It shows that, in the presence of\u00a0missing values, the chances of playing cricket by females are similar to\u00a0males. But, if you look at the second table (after treatment of missing values based on the salutation \u201cMiss\u201d), we can see that females have higher chances of playing cricket compared to males.", "Above, we saw the adverse effect of missing values on the\u00a0accuracy of a trained model. Gladly, we have various methods to deal with missing and outlier values:", "This step helps to extract more information from existing data.\u00a0New information is extracted in terms of new features.\u00a0These features\u00a0may have a higher ability to explain the variance in the training data. Thus, giving improved model accuracy.", "Feature engineering is highly influenced by hypothesis generation. Good\u00a0hypotheses\u00a0result in good features.\u00a0That\u2019s why\u00a0I always suggest investing quality time in hypothesis generation.

But, it is easier said than done.", "This intuition comes with experience and incessant practice. Some algorithms are better suited to a particular type of\u00a0data set than others. Hence, we should apply all relevant models and check the performance.", "We\u00a0know that machine learning algorithms are driven by hyperparameters.\u00a0These hyperparameters\u00a0majorly influence the outcome of the learning process.", "The objective of hyperparameter\u00a0tuning is to find the optimum value for each hyperparameter to improve the accuracy of the model. To tune these hyperparameters, you must\u00a0have a good understanding of these meanings and their individual impact on the model.\u00a0You can repeat this process with a number of well-performing models.", "For example: In a random forest, we have various hyperparameters like max_features, number_trees, random_state, oob_score, and others. Intuitive optimization of these parameter values will result in better and more accurate models.", "You can refer article \u201cTuning the parameters of your Random Forest model\u201d to learn the\u00a0impact of hyperparameter tuning in detail.

This technique\u00a0simply combines the result of multiple weak models and produces\u00a0better results.\u00a0This can be achieved in many ways:", "To know more about these methods, you can refer article \u201cIntroduction to ensemble learning\u201c.", "It is always a better idea to implement\u00a0ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of your model. There are two good reasons for this:", "Till here, we have seen methods that can\u00a0improve the accuracy of a model.\u00a0But, it is not necessary that higher accuracy models always perform better\u00a0(for unseen data points).\u00a0Sometimes, the improvement in the model\u2019s accuracy can be due to over-fitting too.", "To find the right answer to this question, we must use the cross-validation technique.\u00a0Cross Validation is one of the most important concepts in data modeling. It says to try to leave a sample on which you do not train the model and test the model on this sample before finalizing the model.", "This method helps us to achieve\u00a0more generalized relationships. To know more about this cross-validation method, you should refer article \u201cImprove model performance using cross-validation\u201c.", "The process of predictive modeling is tiresome. But, if you can think smart, you can outrun your fellow competition easily. Once you get the data set, follow these proven ways, and you\u2019ll surely get a robust machine-learning model.\u00a0But, implementing these 8 steps can only help you after you\u2019ve mastered these steps individually. For example, you must know of multiple machine learning algorithms such that you can build an ensemble. In this article, I\u2019ve shared 8 proven ways that can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. These methods are widely known but not used in sequence as defined above.", "A. There are several ways to increase the accuracy of a regression model, such as collecting more data, relevant feature selection, feature scaling, regularization, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the learning rate,\u00a0and ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking.", "A. To increase precision in machine learning:\u2013 Improve the quality of training data.\u2013 Perform feature selection to reduce noise and focus on important information.\u2013 Optimize hyperparameters using techniques such as regularization or learning rate.\u2013 Use ensemble methods to combine multiple models and improve precision.\u2013 Adjust the decision threshold to control the trade-off between precision and recall.\u2013 Use different evaluation metrics to better understand the performance of the model.", "A.
