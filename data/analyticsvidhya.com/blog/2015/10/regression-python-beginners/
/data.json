In a similar way, the journey of mastering machine learning algorithms begins ideally with Regression.\u00a0It\u00a0is simple to understand, and gets you started with predictive modeling quickly. While this ease is good for a beginner, I always advice them to also understand the working of regression before they start using it.", "Lately, I have seen a lot of beginners, who just focus on learning how to perform regression (in R or Python) but\u00a0not on the actual science behind it. I am not blaming the beginners alone. Here is a script from a 2 day course on machine learning:", "Running regression in Python and R doesn\u2019t take more than 3-4 lines of code. All you need to do is, pass the variables, run the script and get the predicted values. And congratulations! You\u2019ve run your first machine learning algorithm.", "The course literally spends no time even explaining this simple algorithm, but covers neural networks as part of the course. What a waste of resources!", "So, in this article, I\u2019ve explained regression in a very simple manner. I have covered the basics, so that you not only understand what is regression and how it works, but also how to compute the popular R\u00b2 and the science behind it.", "Just a word of caution, you can\u2019t use it all types of situation. Simple regression has some limitations, which can be overcome by using advanced regression techniques.", "Linear Regression is\u00a0used for\u00a0predictive analysis. It\u00a0is a technique which explains the degree of relationship between two or more variables (multiple regression, in that case) using a best fit\u00a0line / plane. Simple Linear Regression is used when we have, one independent variable and one dependent variable.", "Regression technique tries to\u00a0fit a single line through a scatter plot (see below).\u00a0 The simplest form of regression with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula:", "Let\u2019s understand this equation\u00a0using the scatter plot below:", "Above, you can see that a black line passes through the data points. Now, you carefully notice that this line\u00a0intersects\u00a0the data points at coordinates\u00a0(0,0), (4,8) and (30,60). Here\u2019s a question. Find the equation that describe this line? Your answer should be:", "Now, find the value of a and b?", "With out going in its working, the outcome after solving these equations is:", "This equation is known as linear regression equation, where Y is target variable, X is input variable. \u2018a\u2019 is known as slope and \u2018b\u2019 as intercept.\u00a0It\u00a0\u00a0is used to estimate\u00a0real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on input variable(s). Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best\u00a0line. This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.", "Now, you might think that in above example, there can be multiple regression lines those can pass through the data points. So, how to choose the best fit line or value of co-efficients a and b.", "Let\u2019s look at the methods to find the best fit line.", "We discussed above that regression line establishes a\u00a0relationship between independent and dependent variable(s). A\u00a0line which can explain\u00a0the relationship better is said to be\u00a0best fit line.", "In other words, the best fit line tends to return most accurate value of Y based on X \u00a0i.e. causing a\u00a0minimum difference between actual and predicted value of Y (lower prediction error). Make sure you understand the image below.", "Here are some methods which check for error:", "Let\u2019s evaluate performance of above discussed methods using an\u00a0example. Below I have plotted three lines\u00a0(y=2.3x+4, y=1.8x+3.5 and y=2x+8) to find the relationship between y and x.", "Table shown below\u00a0calculates the\u00a0error value of each data point and the total error value (E) using\u00a0the three methods discussed above:", "After\u00a0looking at the table, the following inferences can be generated:", "Therefore, we can say that these coefficients a and b are derived based on minimizing the sum of squared difference of distance between data points and regression line.", "There are two\u00a0common algorithms to find the right coefficients for minimum sum of squared errors, first one is Ordinary Least Sqaure (OLS, used in python library sklearn) and other one is gradient descent.", "As discussed above, to evaluate the performance of regression line, we should look at the minimum sum of squared errors (SSE). It works well but when it has one concern!", "Let\u2019s understand it using the\u00a0table shown below:", "Above you can see, we\u2019ve removed 4 data points in right table and therefore the SSE has reduced (with same regression line). Further, if you look at the scatter plot, removed data points have almost similar relationship between x and y. It means that SSE is highly sensitive to number of data points.", "Other metric to evaluate the performance of linear regression is R-square and most\u00a0common metric to judge the performance of regression models. R\u00b2 measures,\u00a0\u201cHow much the change in output variable (y) is explained by the change in input variable(x).", "\nR-squared is always between 0 and 1:", "In general, higher the R\u00b2, more robust will be the model. However, there are important conditions for this guideline that I\u2019ll talk about in my future posts..", "Let\u2019s \u00a0take the above example again and calculate the value of R-square.", "As you can see, R\u00b2 has less variation in score compare to SSE.", "One disadvantage of R-squared is that it can only increase as predictors are added to the regression model. This increase is artificial when predictors are not actually improving the model\u2019s fit. To cure\u00a0this, we use \u201cAdjusted R-squared\u201d.", "Adjusted R-squared is nothing but the change of R-square that adjusts the number of terms in a model. Adjusted R square calculates the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable accounted by the explanatory variables. It incorporates the model\u2019s degrees of freedom. Adjusted R-squared will decrease as predictors are added if the increase in model fit does not make up for the loss of degrees of freedom. Likewise, it will increase as predictors are added if the increase in model fit is worthwhile. Adjusted R-squared should always be used with models with more than one predictor variable. It is interpreted as the proportion of total variance that is explained by the model.", "Let\u2019s now examine the process to deal with\u00a0multiple independent variables related to a dependent variable.", "Once you have identified the level of significance between\u00a0independent variables(IV) and\u00a0dependent variables(DV), use these significant IVs to make more powerful and accurate predictions. This technique is known as\u00a0 \u201cMulti-variate Regression\u201d.", "Let\u2019s take an example here to understand this concept further.", "We know that, compensation of a\u00a0person depends on his age i.e. the older one gets, the higher he/she earns as compared to previous year. You build a simple regression model to explain this effect of age on a person\u2019s compensation . You obtain R2 of 27%. What does this mean?", "Let\u2019s try to think over it graphically.", "In this example, R\u00b2 as 27%, says, only 27% of variance in compensation is explained by Age.\u00a0In other words, if you know a person\u2019s age, you\u2019ll have 27% information\u00a0to make an accurate prediction about their compensation.", "Now, let\u2019s\u00a0take an additional variable as \u2018time spent with the company\u2019 to determine the current compensation. By this,\u00a0R2 value increases to 37%. How do we interpret this value now?", "Let\u2019s understand\u00a0this graphically once again:", "Notice that a person\u2019s time with company holds\u00a0only 10% responsible for his/her\u00a0earning by profession. In other words, by adding this variable to our study, we improved our understanding of their compensation\u00a0from 27% to 37%.", "Therefore, we learnt, by using two variables rather than one,\u00a0improved\u00a0the\u00a0ability to make accurate predictions about a person\u2019s salary.", "Things get much more complicated when your multiple independent variables are related to with each other. This phenomenon is known as Multicollinearity. This is undesirable. \u00a0To avoid such situation, it is advisable to look for Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). For no multicollinearity, VIF should be ( VIF < 2).\u00a0In case of high VIF, look for correlation table to find highly correlated variables and drop one of correlated ones.", "In an multiple regression model, we try to predict", "Here, b1, b2, b3 \u2026bk are slopes for each independent variables X1, X2, X3\u2026.Xk and a is intercept.", "Linear regression\u00a0has commonly known implementations in R packages and Python scikit-learn. Let\u2019s look at the code\u00a0of loading linear regression\u00a0model in R and Python below:", "In this article, we looked at linear regression from basics\u00a0followed by methods to find best fit line, evaluation metric, multi-variate regression\u00a0and methods to\u00a0implement in python and R.
