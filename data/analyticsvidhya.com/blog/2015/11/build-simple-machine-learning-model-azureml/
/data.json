For intermediates and experts, it\u2019s just a matter of system capacity, problem understanding and a little\u00a0time. Machine Learning models sometime face the issue of system incompatibility. Specially, when the data set is huge. In such cases, either the\u00a0model\u00a0takes longer to compute or the\u00a0system crashes. Hence, for beginners and experts, the use of machine learning offers untimely\u00a0challenges as well.", "The good news is, machine learning has become a lot easier is last few years. As a beginner in machine learning,\u00a0you can\u00a0kick start your machine learning journey with\u00a0Microsoft AzureML.", "In this article, I\u2019ll impart\u00a0the necessary information to get you started with Machine Learning. Also, I\u2019ve demonstrated a step by step tutorial to create a machine learning model using this software.", "The speed of computation on Microsoft AzureML is comparable to R or Python. Hence, I\u2019d say\u00a0its worth trying for experts also.", "AzureML\u00a0is a GUI implementation of machine learning algorithm by Microsoft. Using this tool, implementation of such algorithm becomes exceptionally easy. If you are versed with E-Miner, than understanding this tool wouldn\u2019t be difficult. I found this tool more resourceful and more graphical than E-Miner.", "Let\u2019s talk about various resources available with this tool.", "Now, you know the potential of AzureML. Let\u2019s now focus on the ways of using them. I will take up an easy to understand example\u00a0to demonstrate the same. I\u2019d suggest you to practice these steps with me to get a better understanding of this tutorial.", "This is where you start\u00a0 \u2013 (By clicking on create a new experiment)", "You get an empty experiment table :", "Now you can choose a pallete:", "Step 1\u00a0: Choose the Data set \u2013\u00a0This can be your sample data or you can upload also. In this tutorial,\u00a0I\u2019ll use\u00a0\u201cBreast Cancer data\u201d from the in-built data sets. Just drag and drop this data in the main window.", "Step 2: Choose a sampling tool: You can use search option from pallette to find the \u201csplit data\u201d option. Place this below your data set and join.", "You now see two touch points at the split data node. This basically means that you have two data sets ready to be taken forward. Towards the\u00a0right side, you have the freedom to choose the type of split.", "Step 3 :\u00a0 Train a machine learning model : You will need two nodes for this step. Firstly, it will be the type of model you want to build. Secondly, it will be the train model node. You can refer to the following figure :", "You can still notice\u00a0an\u00a0exclamation mark in the train model node. It suggests that\u00a0you need to specify the target variable. Let\u2019s choose the target variable by clicking the mark. Now, you would see a window on right side. \u00a0Now choose \u201cLaunch column slector\u201d.", "Here I have chosen \u201cClass\u201d as the target variable.", "Step 4: Now you score: Refer to the following figure", "To visualize any node, you simply go to node, press\u00a0right click, then click visualize.", "Here is how visual data looks like in our case :", "As you can see, Class variable only has two values as expected. This tool neatly draws distribution for each variable and allows you to\u00a0check normality as well.", "Here is how the scored model looks like :", "As clearly visible, the estimated probabilities are mostly near zero and one. The cumulative distribution stays almost flat in between. Hence, the model outputs\u00a0highly segregated values.", "Finally, here is how the evaluation graphs look like :", "As you can see, the model was highly efficient and it took me less than a minute to build and execute. The evaluation matrices computed is quite exhaustive and probably has the number you were looking for. I loved the tool because of the time efficiency and the user ease it provides.", "Did you find this article helpful ? Share with us your experience\u00a0with Azure ML. I\u2019d love to hear you.", "Tavish Srivastava, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Analytics Vidhya, is an IIT Madras graduate and a passionate data-science professional with 8+ years of diverse experience in markets including the US, India and Singapore, domains including Digital Acquisitions, Customer Servicing and Customer Management, and industry including Retail Banking, Credit Cards and Insurance.
