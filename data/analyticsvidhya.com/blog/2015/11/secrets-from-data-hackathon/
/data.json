While the book has been written quite a few years back, the learnings from the book still hold! In his book, Marshall Goldsmith explains that at times the habits which got us at our current place would hold us back from taking ourselves to the next level.", "I saw this live in action (once again) in the hackathon we hosted last weekend! Close to 1200 data scientists across the globe\u00a0participated in Black Friday Data Hack. It was a 72 hours data science challenge\u00a0and\u00a0I am sure every participant from the competition walked away\u00a0as a winner \u2013 taking away\u00a0a ton of learning or earning from it!", "Even in such a short duration contest, all the toppers challenged themselves and took a path less traveled. And guess what, it paid off! Not only did they break away from other data scientists, but they were also able to come out with solutions which stood out from other solutions. More on this later!", "Like always, we decided to experiment with\u00a0ground rules in our hackathon. This time, we simplified the design (no surprises during the hackathon) and made sure that we put in extra efforts on making sure the dataset is good.", "Over the coming days \u2013\u00a0multiple datasets were rejected, various problems were declared as \u201cNot Good Enough\u201d. Finally, we were able to get a dataset, which would have something for everyone. The beginners can perform basic exploration, while there was enough room for out of box thinking for advanced users.", "With close to 1,050 registrations and 3 days to go, we launched the competition on midnight of 19th \u2013 20th November. There was a positive feedback on the dataset with in an hour and people started taking stab at various approaches overnight.", "During the 3 days, we saw close to 2,500 submissions and 162 people making attempts at the leaderboard. The race to the top and top 10 was tough! People were constantly flowing in and flowing out of the race.", "The best part \u2013 there was constant learning for everyone in the process. Leaders happily shared the benchmark scripts. Newbies followed the cues and learnt the tricks of the trade.", "At the end, the winners stood out for what they had done over three days (approaches in detail below). Here were the top 3 finishers:", "Before I reveal their approaches, I\u2019d want to thank these people for their immense co-operation and time. I know that they participate in these hackathons for the learning and the community and have always been helpful whenever I have asked them for any help.\u00a0It\u2019s great to connect with these people.", "Also Read: Exclusive Interview with SRK, Kaggle Rank 25", "A retail company \u201cABC Private Limited\u201d wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.", "The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.", "Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.", "The winner was judged on the basis of root mean squared error (RMSE).\u00a0RMSE is very common and is a suitable general-purpose error metric. Compared to the Mean Absolute Error, RMSE punishes large errors.", "For practice purpose, you can download the data set from here. This link will remain active till 29th November 2015.", "Winners used techniques like Deep Learning, Recommender, Boosting to deliver a winning model with least RMSE. Not many have used such approaches. Hence, it is interesting to acknowledge their implementation and performance. I\u2019ve also shared their codes on our github profile.\u00a0Below are the approaches, these winners used to secure their respective ranks:", "Feature Engineering played a crucial\u00a0role for me in this challenge. Since, all the given variables were categorical in nature, I decided to begin with label encoding. So, I label encoded all the given input variables. Then, built a XGBoost model using these features. I didn\u2019t want it to end here. Therefore, in pursuit of improvement, I tried few other models as well (RandomForest, ExtraTrees etc). But, they failed to\u00a0produce\u00a0better results than GBM.", "Then, I decided to do\u00a0Feature Engineering.\u00a0I\u00a0created two types of encoding for all the variables and added them to the original data set:\n1. Count of each category in the training set\n2. Mean response per category for each of the variables in training set.", "I learnt the second trick from Owen Zhang. Precisely, Slide no. 25 and 26 of his presentation on Tips for data science competitions. This turned out to be favorable for me.\u00a0I tried it out and improved my score.", "Finally, it was time for my finishing move, Ensemble. I built a model model which with weighted average of 4XGB models\u00a0which had different subset of the above mentioned features as inputs.", "I started as a R users. But, I was determined to learn Python. This challenge was a perfect place to test myself.\u00a0So, I\u00a0took this challenge with Python. I knew I had a whole new world to explore,\u00a0still I went ahead.", "It seemed, Python didn\u2019t turn out to be co-operative.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t\u00a0install xgboost in\u00a0Python. Then, I decided to find new ways.", "As a result, I ended up trying several things which were new to me: Python, SFrames and Recommenders.", "SFrames is similar to Pandas but is said to have some advantages over Pandas for large data sets. The only disadvantage is that, it is not so popular and well known. So, if you are stumped \u2013 Google doesn\u2019t help.", "Finally, I resorted to Recommenders. To get a recommender style solution, I used matrix factorization. The library I used was Graphlab.", "I used matrix factorization because, this algorithm configured the data as a matrix containing the target variable, with user ids and product ids as rows and columns. It then filled the blanks in this matrix using factorization. Additionally, it also considered\u00a0features of the users or products such as gender, product category etc. to improve the recommendation. These are called \u2018side features\u2019 in recommender jargon.", "I found the recommender model to be extremely\u00a0powerful, to an extent that I got\u00a0second rank with this algorithm.\u00a0Surprisingly, with NO\u00a0feature engineering, minimal parameter tuning and cross-validation. \u00a0I\u2019m certainly hooked and plan to experiment more with other libraries of recommender algorithms.", "I made 39 submissions in the contest. But, most of them were my failed attempts to get xgboost style results with linear models, random forests etc. Once I started using recommender models, my rank shot up with only a few high impact submissions.\u00a0My final submission was an ensemble of three matrix factorization models, each with slightly different hyper-parameters.", "For those new to recommenders, I suggest you to take this\u00a0Coursera\u2019s MOOC.", "To learn more about graphlab, SFrames, recommenders and machine learning in general,\u00a0I suggest you to take this course by University of Washington on Coursera.", "Here is the\u00a0approach I used in this competition:", "Step 1:\u00a0I considered all variables in the model by converting all of them into categorical features:", "Step 2: Outlier and Missing Value treatment", "Step 3:\u00a0Here is a table\u00a0of all the algorithms which I tried, with their cross-validation scores:", "Note:\u00a0Even though I have tried 5 different algorithms to solve this problem, I selected only two algorithms for my final submission (Deep Learning and GBM). My final model was ensemble of 3 DL and 2 GBM with Weighted Average.", "Step 4: Here is my ensemble of 5 models:", "Note:\u00a0I replaced all \u2013ve predicted values from all the model as there were no negative purchase values in training set but my models had some negative values.", "I used only 3 variables for GBM model as model.as Product_ID,User_ID and Age were significant (shown below).", "GBM Model validation score in H2O", "Most Important parameter in GBM in this case was nbin_cats=6000. This was basically for maximum number of levels in categorical variable. Here\u00a0I have selected 6000 as User_ID and\u00a0got 5891 unique values (you can use 5891 as well but less than that will not give you good result).", "Even though I tuned my model on 70% of training sample and 30 % for validation, but for final submission I had rebuild the model on entire training set using these parameters. This has helped me to\u00a0improve the score by 20 points.", "All the variables considered for all Deep learning Model.\u00a0My best score was from Deep Learning model with RMSE ~2433(Epochs=60 and layers=6) where I have created two more similar deep Learning model with hidden layers 6 and Epochs of (50, 90).", "I really enjoyed participating in this competition. The adrenaline rush to improve my model in 72 hours kept me going. I learnt one thing. Till the time\u00a0one\u00a0doesn\u2019t face\u00a0challenges in your life, it becomes\u00a0extremely difficult to reach the next level. It was indeed a challenging opportunity.", "Like I said at the start, each of these winners did something which made them stand apart. They thought out of the box rather than just tuning parameters for a set of models and that helped them gain the ground. Here are a few things I would highlight as takeaways for myself and the participants:", "More than anything, you might have got huge inspiration from these people, their commitment and their unwillingness to give up. This\u00a0is\u00a0a great example for beginners trying to become successful in data science. Not many of us know to use Deep Learning and Graphlab in our models\u00a0modeling. Hence, you must start practicing these techniques in order to develop your data science skills.", "In this article, the winners of Black Friday Data Hack revealed their approaches which helped them to succeed in this challenge.
