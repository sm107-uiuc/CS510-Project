Further, discrete variables can divided into Nominal (categorical) and Ordinal. We did a post on how to handle categorical variables\u00a0last week, so you would\u00a0expect a similar post on continuous variable. Yes, you are right \u2013 In this article,\u00a0we will explain all possible ways for a beginner to handle continuous variables while doing machine learning or statistical modeling.", "But, before we actually start, first things first.", "Simply put, if a variable can take any value between its minimum and maximum value, then it is called a continuous variable. By nature, a lot of things we deal with fall in this category: age, weight, height being some of them.", "Just to make sure the difference is clear, let me ask you to classify whether a variable is continuous or categorical:", "Please write your answers in comments below.", "While continuous variables are easy to relate to \u2013 that is how nature is in some ways. They are usually more difficult from predictive modeling point of view. Why do I say so? It is because the possible number of ways in which they can be handled.", "For example, if I ask you to analyze sports penetration by gender, it is an easy exercise. You can look at percentage of males and females playing sports and see if there is any difference. Now, what if I ask you to analyze sports penetration by age? How many possible ways can you think to analyze this \u2013 by creating bins / intervals, plotting, transforming and the list goes on!", "Hence, handling continuous variable in usually a more informed and difficult choice. Hence, this article should be extremely useful to beginners.", "Binning refers to\u00a0dividing a list of continuous variables into groups. It is done to discover set of patterns in continuous variables, which are difficult to analyze otherwise. Also, bins are easy to analyze and interpret.\u00a0But, it also\u00a0leads to loss of information and loss of power. Once the bins are created, the information gets compressed into groups which later affects the final model. Hence, it is advisable to create small bins initially.", "This would\u00a0help in minimal loss of information and produces better results. However, I\u2019ve encountered cases where small bins doesn\u2019t prove to be helpful. In such cases, you must decide for bin size according to your hypothesis.We should consider distribution of data prior to deciding bin size.", "For example: Let\u2019s take up the inbuilt data set state.x77 in R to create bins:", "In simpler words, it is a process of comparing variables at a \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018standard\u2019 scale. It helps\u00a0to obtain same range of values. Normally distributed data is easy to read and interpret. As shown below, in a normally distributed data, 99.7% of the observations lie within 3 standard deviations from the mean.\u00a0Also, the mean is zero and standard deviation is one. Normalization technique is commonly used in algorithms such as k-means, clustering etc.", "A commonly used normalization method is z-scores. Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. It\u2019s formula is shown below.", "x = observation,\u00a0\u03bc = mean (population),\u00a0\u03c3 = standard deviation (population)", "For example: Randy scored 76 in maths test. Katie score 86 in science test. Maths test has (mean = 70, sd = 2). Science test has (mean = 80, sd = 3). Who scored better? You can\u2019t say Katie is better since her score is much higher than mean. Since, both values are at different scales, we\u2019ll normalize these value at z scale and evaluate their performance.", "Interpretation:\u00a0Hence, we infer than Randy scored better than Katie. Because, his score is 3 standard deviations away from the class mean whereas Katie\u2019s score is just 2 standard deviations away from mean.", "Transformation is required when we encounter highly skewed data. It is suggested not to work on skewed data in its raw form. Because, it reduces the impact of low frequency values which could be equally significant.\u00a0At times, skewness is influenced by presence of outliers. Hence, we need to be careful while using\u00a0this approach. The technique to deal with outliers is explained in\u00a0next\u00a0sections.", "There are various\u00a0types of transformation methods. Some are Log, sqrt, exp, Box-cox, power etc. The commonly used method is Log Transformation. Let\u2019s understand this using an example.", "For example: I\u2019ve\u00a0score of 22 students. I plot their scores and find out that distribution is left skewed. To reduce skewness, I take\u00a0log transformation (shown below). As you can see after transformation, the\u00a0data is no longer skewed and is\u00a0ready for further treatment.", "Business Logic adds precision to output of a\u00a0model. Data alone can\u2019t suggest you patterns which understanding its business can. Hence, in companies, data scientists often prefer\u00a0to spend time with clients and understand their business and market. This not only helps them to make an informed decision. But, also enables them to think outside the data. Once you start thinking, you are no longer confined within data.", "For example: You work on a data set from Airlines Industry. You must find out the trends, behavior and other parameters prior to data modeling.", "Once you have\u00a0got\u00a0the business logic, you are ready to make smart moves. Many a times, data scientists confine themselves within the data provided. They fail to think differently. They fail to analyze the hidden patterns in data and create new variables. But, you must\u00a0practice this move. You wouldn\u2019t be able to create new features, unless you\u2019ve explored the data to depths.\u00a0This method helps us\u00a0to add more relevant information to our final model. Hence, we obtain increase in accuracy.", "For example:\u00a0I have a data set where you\u2019ve following variables: Age, Sex, Height, Weight, Area, Blood Group, Date of Birth. Here we can make use of our domain knowledge. We know that (Height*Weight) can give us BMI Index. Hence, we\u2019ll create HW = (Height*Weight) as a new variable. HW is nothing but BMI (Body Mass Index). Similarly, you can think of new variables in your data set.", "Data are prone to outliers. Outlier is an abnormal value which stands apart from rest of data points. It can happen due to various reasons. Most common reason include\u00a0challenges\u00a0arising in data collection methods. Sometime the respondents deliberately provide incorrect answers; or the values are actually\u00a0real. Then, how do we decide? You can any of these methods:", "Treating outliers is a tricky situation \u2013 one where you need to combine business understanding and understanding of data. For example, if you are dealing with age of people and you see a value age = 200 (in years), the error is most likely happening because the data was collected incorrectly, or the person has entered age in months. Depending on what you think is likely, you would either remove (in case one) or replace by 200/12 years.", "Sometime data set has\u00a0too many variables. May be, 100, 200 variables or even more. In such cases, you can\u2019t build a model on all variables. Reason being, 1) It would be time consuming. \u00a02) It might have lots of noise 3) A lot of variables will tell similar information", "Hence, to avoid such situation we use PCA a.k.a Principal Component Analysis. It is nothing but, finding out few \u2018principal\u2018 variables which explain significant amount of variation in dependent variable. Using this technique, a large number of variables are reduced to few significant variables. This technique helps to reduce noise, redundancy and enables quick computations.", "In PCA, components are represented by PC1 or Comp 1, PC2 or Comp 2.. and so on. Here, PC1 will have highest variance followed by PC2, PC3 and so on. Our motive should be to select components with\u00a0eigen values greater than 1. Eigen values are represented by \u2018Standard Deviation\u2019. Let check this out in R below:", "Factor Analysis was invented by Charles Spearman (1904). This is a variable\u00a0reduction technique. It is used to determine factor structure or model. It also explains the maximum amount of variance in the model.\u00a0Let\u2019s say some variables are highly correlated. These variables can be grouped by their correlations i.e. all variables in a particular group can be highly correlated among themselves but have low correlation with variables of other group(s). Here each group represents a single underlying construct or factor. Factor analysis is of two types:", "Let\u2019s do exploratory analysis in R. As we run PCA previously, we inferred that Comp 1, Comp 2 and Comp 3. \u00a0We\u2019ve now identified the components. Below is the code for EFA:", "Note: VARIMAX rotation involves shift in coordinates\u00a0which maximizes the sum of the variances of the squared loadings. It rotates the alignment of coordinates orthogonally.", "Presence of Data Time variable in a data set usually give lots of confidence. Seriously! It does. Because, in data-time variable, you get lots of scope to practice the techniques learnt above. You can create bins, you can create new features, convert its type etc. Date & Time is commonly\u00a0found in this format:", "Considering this format, let\u2019s quickly glance through the techniques you can undertake while dealing with data-time variables:", "Have a look at the date format above. I\u2019m sure you can easily figure out the possible new variables. If you have still not figure out, no problem. Let me tell you. We can easily break the format in different variables namely:", "I\u2019ve listed down the possibilities. You aren\u2019t required to create all the listed variables in every situation. Create only those variables which only sync with your hypothesis. Every variable would have an impact( high / low) on dependent variable. You can check it using correlation matrix.", "Once you have extracted new variables, you can now create bins. For example: You\u2019ve \u2018Months\u2019 variable. You can easily create bins to obtain \u2018quarter\u2019, \u2018half-yearly\u2019 variables. In \u2018Days\u2019, you can create bins to obtain \u2018weekdays\u2019. Similarly, you\u2019ll have to explore with these variables. Try and Repeat. Who knows, you might find a variable of highest importance.", "You can also convert date to numbers and use them as numerical variables. This will allow you to analyze dates using various statistical techniques such as correlation. This would be difficult to undertake otherwise. On the basis of their response to dependent variable, you can then create their bins and capture another important trend in data.", "There are three good options for date-time data types: built-in POSIXt, chron package, lubridate package. POSIXt has two types, namely\u00a0POSIXct and POSIXlt. \u201cct\u201d can stand for calendar time and \u201clt\u201d is local time.", "You can\u2019t explore data unless you are curious and patience. Some people are born with them. Some acquire them with experience. In anyway, the techniques listed above would help you to explore continuous variables at any level. I\u2019ve tried to keep the explanation simple. I\u2019ve also shared R codes. However, I haven\u2019t shared their output. You can run these codes. Try to infer the findings.", "In this article, I\u2019ve shared 8 methods to deal with continuous variables. These include binning, variable creation, normalization, transformation, principal component analysis, factor analysis etc. Additionally, I\u2019ve also shared the techniques to deal with date time variables.", "Did you find this article helpful ?
