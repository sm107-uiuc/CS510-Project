I\u2019ve seen lots of people, driven by the spark of becoming a data scientist, but tend to develop disinterest when faced with difficulties.", "Sudalai Rajkumar and Bishwarup Bhattacharjee are taking 8-hours intense workshop during DataHack Summit 2017 on The MasterClass: How To Win Data Science Challenges. Attend this workshop at\u00a0DataHack Summit 2017, 9 \u2013 11 November in Bengaluru.", "The path to become a data scientist isn\u2019t easy as it looks. Even though, you are fortunate enough to have access to free online courses, but it requires unshakable determination to succeed. And, when it comes to securing rank in Top 30 kagglers, you can\u2019t achieve it without hours of coding and developing logical understanding.", "We decided to catch up with\u00a0SRK\u00a0to\u00a0know about his success recipes and source of motivation, which has kept him going all these years. As we know, a journey without struggles isn\u2019t worthy of success, we found out his ways of overcoming with struggles.", "Below is my complete conversation with SRK:", "KJ: First of all, I would like to thank you for devoting time to us. I\u2019m sure, this interview would act as a motivational booster for young aspiring data scientists around the world. Let\u2019s start.", "KJ: You are currently Ranked 25 on Kaggle. How did your journey begin?", "SRK: My kaggle journey started two years back when I started learning\u00a0data science / analytics through MOOC courses.\u00a0I was already working in analytics domain then. But, didn\u2019t\u00a0get any\u00a0opportunity to use\u00a0the advanced analytical techniques (which\u00a0I learnt from the\u00a0courses) in my work. Hence, I started looking for\u00a0opportunities (projects) where I could use those techniques and subsequently came to know about Kaggle through my friends.", "Like every other aspiring data scientist, I started with\u00a0the classic \u201cTitanic\u201d problem for first couple of weeks. Later,\u00a0I realized that I was unable to give my best\u00a0efforts since there were no time constraints,\u00a0being a knowledge competition. Perhaps, I work best with deadlines.", "Then, I\u00a0started working on the \u201cStumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge\u201d. This challenge required building a classifier to categorize webpages as evergreen or non-evergreen. It was a classic binary classification problem. It involved good amount of text mining as well, which\u00a0made it lot more intriguing\u00a0for a newbie like me. Not to forget, those benchmark codes really helped me learn a lot in the competition and kicked my Kaggle journey.", "KJ: It\u2019s being said, \u2018Success never comes to you unless you learn to embrace failures\u2019. Did you have hard time in dealing with data science / analytics as a beginner?", "SRK: Yes. Initially, I found it really hard to secure\u00a0respectful position in the competitions. It took me a year to get my first top 10% finish. Then,\u00a0almost another year to get the \u201cKaggle Master\u201d status.", "As a beginner, I tried\u00a0many approaches while building models but most of them failed to give good results. I felt helpless and lost. But, when I look back in time, I realize that they are not actually failures. But, much needed lessons\u00a0which helped me to perform better in the future\u00a0competitions.", "KJ: What helped you to overcome these difficulties?", "SRK:\u00a0Undoubtedly,\u00a0Kaggle forums\u00a0have helped me a lot. I\u2019ve learnt from\u00a0other people\u2019s views, codes, results and implemented them to improve my mistakes. Like Analytics Vidhya, it is a superb destination\u00a0to learn lots of new things about analytics & data science. Personally, I\u2019ve learnt techniques including XGBoost, Deep learning, Online learning, t-SNE etc., from Kaggle forums.", "Above all, one more difficulty hampered my way. The thing was, some of the\u00a0competitions turn out to be highly frustrating at times, especially when I used to put in lot of efforts into certain approach yet didn\u2019t get any improvement in results. Amidst such difficulties, I didn\u2019t give up! Instead, discovered a way.", "It is essential\u00a0to stay afloat during those times. I\u2019d generally switch to work on a different competition for the next couple of days and then come back to the earlier one. This break helped me clear my mind and gave\u00a0a fresh perspective on the problem.", "In addition, I used to set short term\u00a0targets such as improving the score in the next couple of days by a certain margin, improving my rank in the competition and so on and keep working towards them.", "KJ: How do you decide in which Kaggle competition you should participate?", "SRK:\u00a0I knew this was coming!\u00a0\u00a0When I started, I participated in almost all the competitions that came up. Even now I think I am doing the same, with a slight difference.", "The difference is that, in early days, I used to focus equally on all the competitions. But now, I try\u00a0to select the competitions best suited to my caliber\u00a0and focus more on them. I believe I\u2019m best suited for competition\u00a0which challenges my knowledge\u00a0and needs good amount of effort in feature engineering.", "I still need to learn\u00a0multi-level stacking. Hence,\u00a0I generally refrain myself from taking part actively in such competitions.", "KJ: In recent past, you\u2019ve quickly climbed up in rankings on Kaggle. What\u2019s your next target?", "SRK: Of course getting into top 10 in Kaggle rankings. And, if possible, I\u2019d love to secure the No.1 spot \ud83d\ude09 \u00a0But I think it is still a long way to go !!", "KJ: Do you prefer to work in teams or as in individual ? Which one do you recommend ?", "SRK: I prefer working in a team given that one has got seriously smart\u00a0partner(s). Typically, in a team,\u00a0each member\u00a0tries to think of different ideas / solutions\u00a0and\u00a0combining all these ideas potentially provides a better solution. This is analogous to ensemble modeling, where a number of varied models combine together to produce a single strong model.", "It is generally advisable\u00a0to form team\u00a0at a\u00a0later stage of the competition so that individuals have their own ideas / models before merging.", "But it is also important to work as an individual in few competitions for self-assessment. It will help us to know our strong and weak areas so as to tailor our learning plan accordingly.", "KJ: Tell us 3 things which you\u2019ve learnt in life working as a Data Scientist ?", "SRK:\u00a0Here are my 3 cents:", "1. Understanding the problem \u2013 It is really important to have a thorough understanding of the problem that we are trying to solve. Only after we\u2019ve understood the problem clearly, we can derive\u00a0suitable insights from data to tackle the problem and\u00a0obtain good results. This applies to real life as well.", "2. Structured Thinking \u2013 It\u2019s a unique way of thinking through the problems. Being a data scientist, one needs to be more structured in his/her thinking in order to obtain good results. Else, we might end up shooting in the dark as the number of options are way too many in most of the cases.", "3.\u00a0Effective communication of results \u2013 Effective communication of derived results is as important as performing the\u00a0data\u00a0analysis. At times, it becomes\u00a0difficult to communicate the nuances of final analysis in simple\u00a0language to business people. As a Data Scientist, one must\u00a0learn the art of effective communication.", "KJ: Is there a one for all road map for predictive modeling? According to you, what is an ideal approach (to work on a data set) to derive the best result ?", "SRK:\u00a0I myself, is eager to know that road map if one such exists for predictive modeling. It would be much easier that way. However, here is the approach that I follow (in competitions) is:", "Once you\u2019ve executed these\u00a07 steps, a basic framework will be ready to do more experimentation. Further, you can\u00a0concentrate more on:", "Last but not the least,\u00a0\u00a0we\u00a0must perform a solid local validation. Else, we might end up over fitting on the public leader board.", "KJ: Which machine learning algorithms are the most important to learn and practice ? Why ?", "SRK: Every algorithm has its own advantages and so it is absolutely necessary to learn as many as we can.\u00a0However, here are few algorithms\u00a0which have proved to be extremely helpful to me:", "KJ: What is your suggestion / advice for people keen to become a data scientist?", "SRK: As a (wanna-be) data scientist", "KJ:\u00a0I\u2019m sure your invaluable experience and suggested guidance would help\u00a0many young data scientists to discover the complicated world of data science and machine learning. Thank you once again.", "Kunal is a post graduate from IIT Bombay in Aerospace Engineering. He has spent more than 10 years in field of Data Science. His work experience ranges from mature markets like UK to a developing market like India. During this period he has lead teams of various sizes and has worked on various tools like SAS, SPSS, Qlikview, R, Python and Matlab.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
