In this article learn about how online learning differs from batch learning."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Data is being generated in huge quantities everywhere. Twitter generates 12 + TB of data every day, Facebook generates 25 + TB of data everyday and Google generates much more than these quantities everyday. Given that such data is being produced everyday, we need to build tools to handle data with high", "1. Volume : High volume of data are stored today for any industry. Conventional models on such huge data are infeasible.", "2. Velocity : Data come at high speed and demand quicker learning algorithms.", "3. Variety : Different sources of data have different structures. All these data contribute to prediction. A good algorithm can take in such variety of data.", "A simple predictive algorithm like Random Forest on about 50 thousand data points and 100 dimensions take 10 minutes to execute on a 12\u00a0GB RAM machine. Problems with hundreds of millions of observation is simply impossible to solve using such machines. Hence, we are left with only two options : Use a stronger machine or change the way a predictive algorithm works. First option is not always feasible. In this article we will learn about On-line Learning algorithms which are meant to handle data with such high Volume and Velocity with limited performance machines.", "If you are a starter in the analytics industry, all you would have probably heard of will fall under batch learning category. Let\u2019s try to visualize how the working of the two differ from each other.", "Batch learning algorithms take batches of training data to train a model. Then predicts the test sample using the found relationship. Whereas, On-line learning algorithms take an initial guess model and then picks up one-one observation from the training population and recalibrates the weights on each input parameter. Here are a few trade-offs in using the two algorithms.", "In cases where we deal with huge data, we are left with no choice but to use online learning algorithms. The only other option is to do a batch learning on a smaller sample.", "We want to predict the probability that it will rain today. We have a panel of 11 people who predict the class : Rain and non-rain on different parameters. We need to design an algorithm to predict the probability. Let us first initialize a few denotions.", "w(i) \u00a0is the weight given to the i th predictor", "We will predict that it will rain today if,", "Sum(w(i) for all rain prediction) > Sum(w(i) for all non rain prediction)", "Once, we have the actual response of the target variable, we now send a feedback on the weights of all the parameters. In this case we will take a very simple feedback mechanism. For every right prediction, we will keep the weight of the predictor same. While for every wrong prediction, we divide the weight of the predictor by 1.2 (learning rate). With time we expect the model to converge with a right set of parameters.We created a simulation with 1000 predictions done by each of the 11 predictors. Here is how our accuracy curve came out,", "Each observation was taken at a time to re adjust the weights. Same way we will make predictions for the future data points.", "Online learning algorithms are widely used by E-commerce and social networking industry. It is not only fast but also has the capability to capture any new trend visible in with time. A variety of feedback systems and converging algorithms are presently available which should be selected as per the requirements. In some of the following articles, we will also take up a few practical examples of Online learning algorithm applications.", "Did you find the article useful?
