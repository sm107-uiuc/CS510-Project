In this article, we will look at the most common and frequently used method of combining data sets \u2013 MERGING or JOINING.", "Before jumping into the details, let us understand why we actually need joining / merging. Whenever we have some information split and available into two or more data sets and we want to combine them into a single dataset, we need to merge / join these tables. One of the main things to be kept in mind is that the merging should be based on common criteria or field. For example, In a retail company, we have a daily Transaction table (Table contains Products Detail, Sales Detail and Customers Detail) and Inventory table (which has Product Detail and Available quantity). Now, to have the information on Inventory or the availability of a product, what we need to do? Combine the Transaction table with Inventory table based on Product_Code and subtract the sold quantity from available quantity.", "Merging / Joining can be of various types and it depends on the business requirement and relationship between data sets. First, let us look at various kinds of relation between data sets can have.", "In SAS, we can \u00a0perform Joining/ Merging\u00a0through various ways, here we will discuss the most common ways \u2013 Data Step and PROC SQL. In Data step, we use Merge statement to perform joins, where as in PROC SQL, we write SQL query. Let us discuss\u00a0Data step first:", "Note:- Data sets must be sorted by common variable(s) and the name, type and length of the common variable should be same for all input data sets.", "Let\u2019s look at some scenarios for each of the relationships between input data sets.", "Scenario:-1 In below input data sets, you can see that there is one to one relationship between these two tables on Student_ID. Now we want to create data set\u00a0MARKS, where we have all unique student_ids with respective marks of maths and physics. If student_id is not available in Mathematics table, then math_marks should have missing value and vice versa.", "You can perform a dry run to evaluate the result data set.", "Scenario\u00a02:-\u00a0Based on input data sets of scenario-1, we want to create below output data sets.", "Solution using Data Steps:-\u00a0Let\u2019s write code similar to scenario-1 with IN option.\u00a0Above, you can see that we have used IN option with both input data sets and assigned values of these to temporary variables MATH and PHYS because these are temporary variable so we can not see those in output data set.", "I have shown you the table (PDV data) having variable value for all observation along with temporary variables. Now, based on these variable value, we can write a code for sub setting and JOIN operations as we need:", "Scenario \u2013 3\u00a0Here we have two data sets, Student\u00a0and Exam\u00a0and we want to create a output data set Marks.", "Above you look at input data sets, there is one-to-many relationship between Student and Exam. Now if you want to create output data set Marks having individual observation for each\u00a0exam of students, those belongs to the STUDENT data set i.e Left Join.", "In similar way, we can perform operation for Inner, Right and Full join for one-to-many relationship using IN operator.", "Scenario 4: Create a output data sets having all combination based on common field.\u00a0You can also see that both input data sets has Many-to-Many relationship.", "Data steps does not perform MANY-to-MANY relationship, because it does not provide\u00a0output as Cartesian product. When we merge table A and table B using data steps\u00a0than output is similar as below snapshot.", "Above we have seen, how can we use data steps to merge two or more data sets having any of the relationship except MANY to MANY. Now we will look at PROC SQL methods to have solution for similar requirements.", "To understand join methodology in SQL, we need to understand Cartesian product first. Cartesian product is a query that has multiple tables in from clause and produces all possible combination of rows from input tables. If we have two tables with 2 and 4 records respectively, then using Cartesian product, we have a table with 2 X 4=8 records.", "SQL joins works for each of the relationship between data sets (One-to-One, One-to-Many and Many-to-Many). Let\u2019s look at how it works with types of joins.", "Select Column-1, Column-2,\u2026Column-n from table1 INNER/ LEFT/ RIGHT/ FULL JOIN table2\u00a0ON\u00a0Join-condition <Other clauses>;", "Let\u2019s solve above requirements using PROC SQL.", "Scenario\u00a0-1 :-\u00a0This was an example of FULL Join, where all Student_IDs was required in output data set with respective MATH and PHYSICS marks.", "Above in output data set, you can see that Student_ID is missing for those student have appeared only for Physics exam. To solve it we will use a function COALESCE. It returns the value of first non missing argument from given variables.", "Scenario 2\u00a0:-\u00a0This was an example of INNER, Left and right Join. Here we are solving for Inner Join.\u00a0Similarly we can do for left and right join.", "Scenario -3\u00a0This was a problem of left join for ONE-to-MANY relationship.", "Scenario -4\u00a0This was a problem of Many-to-MANY relationship. We have already discussed that SQL can produces Cartesian product that contains all combination of records between\u00a0two tables.", "Above we have looked at Proc SQL to join/ merge data sets.", "In this series of articles regarding combining data sets in SAS, we looked at various methods to combine data sets like appending, concatenating, interleaving , Merging. Particularly in this article, we discussed that depending on relationship between data sets, various kinds of joins and how can we solve it based on different scenarios. We have used\u00a0two methods (Data Steps and PROC SQL) to achieve results. We will look at efficiency of these methods\u00a0in one of the future article.", "Have\u00a0you found this series useful?
