People loved it and shared it across social media channels. We got a few requests from people outside India to create some thing similar for other geographies.", "Given the response, I thought it would be interesting to share the story about creating this web application.\u00a0Following\u00a0reasons make it a very interesting read:", "Less than\u00a0a week ago, Sunil, Sahil, Manish & I were sitting and sipping our \u2018chai\u2019 (Indian white tea) in scorching Delhi heat. A walk to the tea stall after our lunch is almost a part of our daily routine now!\u00a0Manish took his sip and then looked at Sunil & me with his trademark smile. The look in his eyes told us that he was about to give a suggestion (in form of a question) \u2013 this was typical Manish.", "Only this time, we would implement and go live with his idea in next 3 days!", "So, what was the idea? Manish said \u201cWe blog awesome articles on\u00a0analytics and have some of the best experts in our team. Why don\u2019t we create a case study based on the data we have with us?\u201d By the time we walked back to our hack room (i.e. our office), a new idea was already taking shape:", "We had more than 17,000 data points and profiles of people in India (including their salaries), whom we have interacted with in last one year. How about using this information to find insights in data science industry?", "After a few minutes of huddle / brainstorming at the \u2018Gyaan-board\u2019 (the white board), we finalized the idea:", "With the data we already have, we will build a web application which could predict the salary of an analytics professional based on a few inputs he / she provides.", "Our query into the database showed us that there were 17,413 data points with more than 30 variables in total. This data was related to various\u00a0professionals related to Data science / Big Data / Machine Learning, Business intelligence and other domains.", "A closer look into these variables showed us that only about half of the variables were good enough for modelling perspective. This is because we removed all the sensitive data like contact details, Date of birth and variables where more than 30% of information was missing.", "The available variables could be classified in following classes:", "There were some additional variables, we could pull from more sources like the interaction these people had on Analytics Vidhya, their level of involvement in learning based on interactions with us, GitHub profile details, Linkedin profile details. We agreed to use these variables for a later build. For now, we were looking at implementing something quick and see, if our audience loves it.", "For\u00a0those of you, who are thinking that the data was clean and structured, let me warn you! The dataset had a lot of challenges. Here are a few of them, just to provide an overview.", "After doing all the data exploration or munging, we used regression\u00a0tree as a modeling technique. We could have looked at other techniques as well, but regression trees are easy to implement (more on this later) and we could implement them in our wordpress setup without a lot of modifications (Tip: Keep implementation of a project in mind from start). Here are a few insights which came out of the analysis:", "As expected, higher experience has higher compensation. But, if you look at the distribution mix of work experience, it also shows the average vintage of this domain is near about ~5 years.", "Below visualization clearly shows that as you upgrade your skills, better compensation is waiting for you so it\u2019s time to upgrade your skills. You can follow learning path of Python, R, SAS and Qlikview here.", "Have you graduated from Tier1 colleges? Here is some good news for you. The heat map below shows the willingness of analytics companies to pay premium for talent from Tier 1 institutes.", "Mumbai and Kolkata have slightly better compensation compared to other top 5 cities. But, if look at the distribution, it clearly shows the penetration of industries is more in Mumbai, Delhi NCR and Bangalore.", "For the die-hard statisticians, some of the graphs above warrant confidence intervals along with these disclaimers. These plots were created to understand the trends rather than reaching conclusions. Also, the sample size was large, so the intervals would be small compared to the variation we are seeing here.", "Once we had the decision tree ready, we quickly validated it on a smaller dataset. We found the model to provide right classification in 70% of the cases \u2013 not bad given the amount of dirty cuts, we had made in last 1.5 days.", "This was Thursday afternoon! We had a basic model ready, we did some tweaks to the model in next half a day, but it was a good draft. We decided that we would make this test live on Saturday morning because a lot of job search happens over the weekend. This meant we had less than 1.5 days for all other preparations. Over the next 36 hours, we did the following:", "Thankfully, we pulled it all together over a few Pizzas and burgers. Our interns extended help for model implementation and to finish all the required testing. The test went live on Saturday morning and reached out to more than 15,000 people over the weekend \u2013 not a bad reach for a 3 day hack! We spent most of the Saturday cleaning up the corners we had cut during the process and celebrated the achievement over a movie and dinner in the evening.", "This is the fastest turn-around I have done on a predictive model \u2013 this is what we love about the start-up life. Here is what our Facebook walls looked like over the weekend:", "While Sahil and Manish were unwinding, Sunil & I were conducting a Hackathon \u2013 action never stops!", "We loved the experience of creating something like Analytics Professional Salary test from scratch in a period of 3 days. It wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 there were times, when we thought we are pushing too much, but then we did!", "Is the app perfect? The answer is no. Here are some disclosures. I think there are still areas of improvement. I have a hypothesis that the test is under-predicting because the salary data is coming from people who were searching for jobs and low salary could be one of the reasons for the lookout. But even with its limitations, I think we have created a unique, one of its kind app here. I would love to hear your thoughts on what you think about the app and what additional features would you want it to have. Looking forward to it.", "Kunal is a post graduate from IIT Bombay in Aerospace Engineering. He has spent more than 10 years in field of Data Science. His work experience ranges from mature markets like UK to a developing market like India. During this period he has lead teams of various sizes and has worked on various tools like SAS, SPSS, Qlikview, R, Python and Matlab.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
