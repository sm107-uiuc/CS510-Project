In fact, it is being said that ensemble modeling offers one of the most convincing way to build highly accurate predictive models. The\u00a0availability of bagging and boosting algorithms further embellishes this method to produce awesome accuracy level.", "So, next time when you build a predictive model, do consider using this algorithm. You would definitely pat my back for this suggestion. And, if you\u2019ve already mastered this method, great. I\u2019d love to hear your experience about ensemble modeling in the comments section below.", "For the rest, I am sharing some of the most commonly asked questions on ensemble modeling. If you ever wish to evaluate any person\u2019s knowledge on ensemble, you can daringly ask these questions & check his / her knowledge.\u00a0In addition, these are among the easiest questions, hence you can\u2019t dare to get them wrong!", "After analyzing\u00a0various data science forums, I have identified the 5 most common questions related to ensemble modeling.\u00a0These questions are highly\u00a0relevant to data scientists new to ensemble modeling. Here are the questions:", "Let\u2019s discuss each question in detail.", "Let\u2019s try to understand it by solving a classification challenge.", "Problem: Set rules for classification of spam emails", "Solution:\u00a0We can generate various rules for classification of spam emails, let\u2019s look at the some of them:", "Above, I\u2019ve listed some common rules for filtering the SPAM e-mails. Do\u00a0you think that all these rules individually can\u00a0predict the correct\u00a0class?", "Most of us would say no \u2013 And that\u2019s true! Combining these rules will provide robust prediction as compared to prediction done by individual rules. This is the principle of Ensemble Modeling.\u00a0Ensemble model combines multiple \u2018individual\u2019 (diverse) models together and delivers superior prediction power.", "If you want to relate this to real life, a group of people are likely to\u00a0make better decisions compared to\u00a0individuals, especially when group members come from diverse background. The same is true with machine learning.\u00a0Basically, an ensemble is a supervised learning technique for combining multiple\u00a0weak learners/ models\u00a0to produce a strong learner. Ensemble model\u00a0works better, when we ensemble models with low correlation.", "A good example of how ensemble methods are commonly used to solve data science problems is the random forest algorithm (having multiple CART models). It performs better compared to individual CART model by classifying a new object where each tree gives \u201cvotes\u201d for that class and the forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest). In case of regression, it takes the average of outputs of different trees.", "You can also follow this article \u201cBasics of Ensemble Learning Explained in Simple English\u201d for more knowledge on ensemble modeling.", "Let\u2019s look at each of these individually and try to understand the differences between these terms:", "Bagging\u00a0(Bootstrap Aggregating) \u00a0is an ensemble method. First, we create random\u00a0samples of the training data set (sub sets of training data set). Then, we build a classifier for each sample. Finally, results of these multiple classifiers are combined using average or majority voting. Bagging helps to reduce the variance error.", "Boosting provides sequential learning of the predictors. The first predictor\u00a0is learned on the whole data set, while the following are learnt on the training set based on the performance of the previous one. It\u00a0starts by classifying original data set and giving equal weights to each observation. If classes are predicted incorrectly using the first learner, then it gives higher weight to the missed classified observation. Being an iterative process, it continues to add classifier learner until a limit is reached in the number of models or accuracy.\u00a0Boosting has shown better predictive accuracy than bagging, but it also tends to over-fit the training data as well.\u00a0", "Most common example of boosting is AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting. You can also look at these articles to know more about boosting algorithms.", "Getting smart with Machine Learning \u2013 AdaBoost and Gradient Boost", "Learn Gradient Boosting Algorithm for better predictions (with codes in R)", "Stacking\u00a0works in two phases. First, we use multiple base classifiers\u00a0to predict the class. Second, a\u00a0new learner is used\u00a0to combine their predictions with the aim of reducing the generalization error.\u00a0", "Yes, we can combine multiple models of same ML algorithms, but\u00a0combining multiple predictions generated by different algorithms would normally give you better predictions. It is due to the diversification or independent nature as compared to each other. For example, the predictions of a random forest, a KNN, and a Naive Bayes\u00a0may be combined to create a stronger final prediction set as compared to combining three random forest model. The key to creating a powerful ensemble is model diversity. An ensemble with two techniques that are very similar in nature will perform poorly than a more diverse model set.", "Example:\u00a0Let\u2019s say we have three models (A, B and C).\u00a0A, B and C have\u00a0prediction accuracy of 85%, 80% and 55% respectively. But A and B are found to be highly correlated where as C is meagerly correlated with both A and B. Should we combine A and B? No, we shouldn\u2019t, because these models are highly correlated. Hence,we will not combine these two as this ensemble will not help to reduce any generalization error. I would prefer to combine A & C or B & C.", "One of the most common challenge with ensemble modeling is to find optimal weights to ensemble base models. In general, we\u00a0assume equal weight for all models and takes the average of predictions. But, is this the best way to deal with this challenge?", "There are various methods to find the optimal weight for combining all base learners. These methods provide a fair understanding about finding the right weight. I am listing some of the methods below:", "You can also look at\u00a0the winning solution of Kaggle / data science competitions to understand other methods to deal with this challenge.", "The aggregate opinion of a multiple\u00a0models is less noisy than other models. In finance, we called it \u201cDiversification\u201d \u00a0a mixed portfolio of many stocks will be much less variable than just one of the stocks alone. This is also why your models will be better with\u00a0ensemble of models rather than individual. One of the caution with ensemble models are over fitting although bagging takes care of it largely.", "In this article, we have looked at the 5 \u00a0frequently asked questions on Ensemble models.\u00a0While answering these questions, we have\u00a0discussed about \u201cEnsemble Models\u201d, \u201cMethods of Ensemble\u201d, \u201cWhy should we ensemble diverse models?\u201d, \u201cMethods to identify optimal weight for ensemble\u201d and finally \u201cBenefits\u201d. I would suggest you to look at the top 5 solutions of data science competitions and see\u00a0their ensemble approaches to have better understanding and practice a lot.
