Here are a few examples:", "Here was a little funny (but immensely true) take on the topic we circulated on our Facebook page recently.", "Coming to the point, given the amount of confusion on the topic, we thought to create an awesome introductory series of articles on machine learning. The idea is to do away with all the jargons, which might have intimidated you in past and create something which can be read by a 5 year old (ok\u2026sorry, may be a high school pass out)!", "Just to make sure I don\u2019t over-estimate (or under-estimate) the capability of the target audience, I got hold of 10 people who were\u00a0completely new to analytics. None of them had heard about machine learning before (yes, there are people like that!). Here is what they said:", "That was fun! Perfect group to explain machine learning to. Here is how I started explaining to these people:", "Machine Learning refers to the techniques involved in dealing with vast data in the most intelligent fashion (by developing algorithms) to derive actionable insights.", "By this time, they were looking at me as if I have spoken a few things in front of people from Mars! So, I stopped and then asked them a question in return, which they could relate to more:", "KJ: What do you think happens when you search for something on Google?", "Group: Google shows up the most relevant web pages related to that search.", "KJ: That\u2019s good! but what really happens so that Google can show these relevant pages to you?", "This time it looked like they were thinking a bit more. Then some one from the group spoke", "Group member: Google looks at the past clicks from the people to understand which pages are more relevant for those searches and then serves those results on top of search.", "This was\u00a0a far better attempt. I also had to control my urge to preach that how Google does this is far more smarter way than this simple concept. But, I thought I had a good hook to explain machine learning here. So, I continued:", "KJ: OK, that sounds like a good approach. But, how many searches and what all kind of searches would Google handle regularly?", "Group: Must be a real big number \u2013 may be a trillion searches every year", "KJ: So, how do you think Google can serve so many requests with such accuracy? Do you think there are people sitting in Google offices and continuously deciding which search result is relevant and which is not?", "Group member:\u00a0Haven\u2019t really thought about it, but no, that sounds humanly impossible to do.", "KJ: You are right. This is where machine learning comes into play. Machine learning is a set of techniques, which help\u00a0in dealing with vast data in the most intelligent fashion (by developing algorithms or set of logical rules) to derive actionable insights (delivering search for users in this case).", "A logical nod from the group, looks like mission accomplished\u2026yay! But wait\u2026", "The minute you start reading about machine learning, you see various rockets bombarding you with high velocity. These are jargons used loosely in the industry. Here are some of them:\u00a0Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Data Mining and Statistics.", "For your\u00a0clear understanding, I have explained these terms below in the simple manner. You will also understand the importance of these terms\u00a0in context of machine learning:", "It\u00a0refers to the procedure of\u00a0programming a computer (machine) to take rational.\u00a0Ah!\u00a0what is rational? Rational\u00a0is the basis of taking a decision.", "I mentioned \u2018rational\u2019 instead of intelligence (as expected) because\u00a0we human beings tend to\u00a0take decisions which are high on being\u00a0rational and feasible rather than being explicitly intelligent. This is because all intelligent decisions\u00a0needn\u2019t\u00a0be rational and feasible (my hypothesis).\u00a0Hence, the central motive behind using\u00a0AI is to achieve the computer (machine) behave in a dandy fashion in lieu of human guidance instead of being doltish!", "AI may include programs to check whether certain parameters within a program are behaving normally. For example, the machine may raise an alarm if a parameter say \u2018X\u2019 crosses a certain threshold which might in turn affect the outcome of the related process.", "Machine Learning is a subset of AI where the machine is trained to learn from it\u2019s past experience. The past experience is developed through the data collected. Then it combines with\u00a0algorithms such as\u00a0Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine(SVM) to deliver the final results.", "At this high level stage, I assume you would know about statistics. If you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a quick definition,\u00a0Statistics is that branch of mathematics which utilizes data, either of the entire population or a sample drawn from the population to carry out the analysis and present inferences. Some statistical techniques used are regression,variance, standard deviation, conditional probability and many others. To know about this topic, read How to understand population distributions using statistics?", "Let\u2019s understand this. Suppose, I need to separate the mails in my inbox into two categories: \u2018spam\u2019 and \u2018important\u2019. For identifying the spam mails, I can use a machine learning algorithm known as Na\u00efve Bayes which will check\u00a0the frequency of the past\u00a0 spam mails to identify the new email as spam. Na\u00efve Bayes uses the statistical technique Baye\u2019s theorem( commonly known as conditional probability).\u00a0Hence, we can say\u00a0machine learning algorithms uses statistical concepts to execute machine learning.", "Additional Information:\u00a0The main difference between machine learning and statistical models come from the schools where they originated. While machine learning originated from the department of computer science and statistical modelling came down from department of mathematics. Also any statistical modelling assumes a number of distributions while machine learning algorithms are generally agnostic of the distribution of all attributes.", "Deep Learning is associated with a machine learning algorithm (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) which uses the concept of human brain to facilitate the modeling of arbitrary functions. ANN requires a vast amount of data and this algorithm is highly flexible when it comes to model multiple outputs simultaneously.\u00a0ANN is more complex topic and we may do justice to it in an altogether separate article.", "During my initial days as an analyst, I always used to muddle the two terms: Machine Learning and Data Mining. But, later I learnt,\u00a0Data Mining deals with searching specific information.\u00a0And Machine Learning solely concentrates on performing a given task. Let me cite the\u00a0example which helped me to remember the difference; Teaching someone how to dance is Machine Learning. And using someone to find best dance centers in the city is Data Mining. Easy!", "Also Read: Introduction to Online Machine Learning", "Teaching the machines involve a structural process where every stage builds a better version of the machine.\u00a0For simplification purpose, the process of teaching machines can broken down into 3 parts:", "I shall be covering each of these 3 steps in detail in my subsequent write-ups. As of now, you should understand, these 3 steps ensures the holistic learning of the machine to perform the given task with equal\u00a0importance. Success of machine depends on two factors:", "1. How well the generalization of abstraction data take place.", "2. How well the machine is able to put it\u2019s learning into practical usage for predicting the future course of action.", "Also\u00a0Read: Learn about Scikit-Learn \u2013 Machine Learning tool in Python", "There are 5 basic steps used to perform a machine learning task:", "Be it any model, these 5 steps can be used to structure the technique and when we discuss the algorithms, you shall then find how these five steps appear in every model!", "Also Read: Getting Smart with Machine Learning \u2013 Ada Boost and Gradient Boost", "Predictive model as the name suggests is used to predict the future outcome based on the historical data. Predictive models are normally given clear instructions right from the beginning as in what needs to be learnt and how it needs to be learnt. These class of learning algorithms are termed as Supervised Learning.", "For example: Supervised Learning is used when a marketing company is trying to find out which customers are likely to churn. We can also use it to predict the likelihood of occurrence of perils like earthquakes, tornadoes etc. with an aim to determine the Total Insurance Value. Some examples of algorithms used are:\u00a0Nearest neighbour, Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Trees, Regression etc.", "It\u00a0is used to train descriptive models where no target is set and no single feature is important than the other. The case of unsupervised learning can be:\u00a0When a retailer wishes to find out what are the combination of products, customers tends to buy more frequently. Furthermore, in pharmaceutical industry, unsupervised learning may be used to predict which diseases are likely to occur along with diabetes. Example of algorithm used here is:\u00a0K- means Clustering Algorithm", "It is an example of machine learning where the machine is trained to take specific decisions based on the business requirement with the sole motto to maximize efficiency (performance). The idea involved in reinforcement learning is: The machine/ software agent trains itself on a continual basis based on the environment it is exposed to, and applies it\u2019s enriched knowledge to solve business problems. This continual learning process ensures less involvement of human expertise which in turn saves a lot of time!", "An example of\u00a0algorithm used in RL is Markov Decision Process.", "Important Note:\u00a0There is a subtle difference between Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL).\u00a0RL essentially involves learning by interacting with an environment. An RL agent learns from its past experience, rather from its continual trial and error learning process as against supervised learning where an external supervisor\u00a0 provides examples.", "A good example to understand the difference is self driving cars. Self driving cars use Reinforcement learning to make decisions continuously \u2013 which route to take? what speed to drive on? are some of the questions which are decided after interacting with the environment. A simple manifestation for supervised learning would be to predict fare from a cab going from one place to another.", "It is very interesting to know the applications of machine learning. Google and Facebook uses ML extensively to push their respective ads to the relevant users. Here are a few applications that you should know:", "These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Machine learning has extensive applications practically in every domain. You can check out a few Kaggle problems to get further flavor. The examples included above are easy to understand and at least give a taste of the omnipotence of machine learning.", "In this article, we started by developing a basic understanding of what machine learning is. We also looked at how it gets confused with several other terms. We also covered\u00a0the process\u00a0to teach a machine, the essential steps used in machine learning, the algorithms used in machine learning followed by the applications of machine learning.", "I hope this article helped you to get acquainted with basics of machine learning.
