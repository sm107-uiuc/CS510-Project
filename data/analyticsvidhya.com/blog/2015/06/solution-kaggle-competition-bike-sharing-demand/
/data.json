These people aim to learn from the experts and the discussions happening and hope to become better with time.", "Type 3: Who are new to data science and still choose to participate and gain experience\u00a0of solving a data science problem.", "If you think you fall in Type 2 and Type 3,\u00a0go ahead and check how I got close to rank 150. I would strongly recommend you to type out the code and follow the article as you go. This will help you develop your data science muscles and they will be in better shape in the next challenge.

People can rent a bike through membership (mostly regular users) or on demand basis (mostly casual users). This process is controlled by a network of automated kiosk across the city.", "Here is the step by step solution of this competition:", "Before exploring the data to understand\u00a0the relationship between variables, I\u2019d recommend you to focus on hypothesis generation first. Now, this might sound counter-intuitive for solving a data science problem, but if there is one thing I have learnt over years, it is this. Before exploring data, you should spend some time thinking about the business problem, gaining the domain knowledge and may be gaining first hand experience of the problem (only if I could travel to North America!)", "How does it help? This practice usually helps you form better features later on, which are not biased by the data available in the dataset.

These values are not generated due to error, so we consider them\u00a0as natural outliers. They might be a result of groups of people taking up cycling (who are not registered). To\u00a0treat such\u00a0outliers, we will use logarithm transformation.
