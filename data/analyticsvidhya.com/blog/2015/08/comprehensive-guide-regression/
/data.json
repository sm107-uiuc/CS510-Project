Due to their popularity, a lot of analysts even end up thinking that they are the only form of regressions. The ones who are slightly more involved think that they are the most important among all forms of regression analysis.", "The truth is that there are innumerable forms of regressions, which can be performed. Each form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply. In this article, I have explained the most commonly used 7 types of regression in data science in a simple manner.", "Through this article, I also hope that people develop an idea of the breadth of regressions, instead of just applying linear/logistic regression to every machine learning problem they come across and hoping that they would just fit!", "We also have the video format of the main regression analysis technique in the following free course- Fundamentals of Regression Analysis", "And if you\u2019re new to data science and looking for a place to start your journey,\u00a0 we have some comprehensive courses that you might be interested in-", "Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent\u00a0(target)\u00a0and independent variable (s) (predictor).\u00a0This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, relationship between rash driving and\u00a0number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression.", "Regression analysis is an important tool for modelling and analyzing data.\u00a0Here, we fit a curve / line to the data points, in such a manner that the differences between\u00a0the distances of data points from the curve or line is minimized. \u00a0I\u2019ll explain this in more details in coming sections.", "As mentioned above, regression analysis estimates\u00a0the relationship between two or more variables. Let\u2019s understand this with\u00a0an easy example:", "Let\u2019s say, you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the recent company data which\u00a0indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy. Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current & past information.", "There are multiple benefits of using regression analysis. They are as follows:", "Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities.\u00a0These benefits help market researchers / data analysts / data scientists to eliminate and evaluate\u00a0the best set of variables to be used for\u00a0building predictive models.", "There are various kinds of regression techniques available to make predictions. These techniques are mostly driven by\u00a0three metrics (number of independent variables, type of dependent variables and shape of regression line). We\u2019ll discuss them in\u00a0detail in the following sections.", "For the creative ones, you can even cook up new regressions, if you feel the need to use a combination of the parameters above, which people haven\u2019t used before. But before you start that, let us understand the most commonly used regressions.", "It is one of the most widely known modeling technique. Linear regression is usually among the first few topics which people pick while learning predictive modeling.\u00a0In this technique,\u00a0the dependent variable is continuous, independent variable(s) can be continuous or discrete,\u00a0and nature of regression line is linear.", "Linear Regression\u00a0establishes a\u00a0relationship between dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent\u00a0variables (X) using a best fit straight line (also known as regression line).", "It is\u00a0represented by an equation Y=a+b*X + e, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line\u00a0and\u00a0e is error term. This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor\u00a0variable(s).", "The difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is that, multiple linear regression has (>1) independent variables, whereas simple linear regression has only 1 independent variable. \u00a0Now, the question is \u201cHow do we obtain\u00a0best fit line?\u201d.", "This task can be easily accomplished by Least Square Method.\u00a0It is\u00a0the most common method used for fitting a regression line. It\u00a0calculates the best-fit line for the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line. Because the deviations are first squared, when added, there\u00a0is\u00a0no cancelling out between positive and negative values.", "We can evaluate\u00a0the model performance using the metric\u00a0R-square. To know more details about these metrics, you can read:\u00a0Model Performance metrics Part 1, Part 2\u00a0.", "Logistic regression is used to find the probability of event=Success and event=Failure. We should\u00a0use logistic regression when the\u00a0dependent variable is binary (0/ 1, True/ False, Yes/ No) in nature. Here the value of Y ranges from 0 to 1 and it can represented by following equation.", "Above, p is the probability of presence of the characteristic of interest. A question that you should ask here is\u00a0\u201cwhy have we used log in the equation?\u201d.", "Since\u00a0we are working here with a\u00a0binomial distribution (dependent variable), we need to choose a link function which is best suited for this\u00a0distribution. And, it is logit function. In the equation above, the parameters are chosen\u00a0to maximize the likelihood of observing the sample values rather than minimizing the sum of squared errors (like in ordinary regression).", "Note: You can understand the above regression techniques in a video format \u2013 Fundamentals of Regression Analysis", "A regression equation is a polynomial regression equation if the power of independent variable is more than 1. The equation below represents a polynomial equation:", "In this regression technique, the best fit line is not a straight line. It\u00a0is rather a curve that fits into the data points.", "This form of regression is used\u00a0when we deal with multiple independent variables. In this technique, the selection of independent variables is\u00a0done with the help of an automatic process, which involves\u00a0no human intervention.", "This feat\u00a0is achieved by observing\u00a0statistical\u00a0values like R-square, t-stats and AIC metric to discern\u00a0significant variables.\u00a0Stepwise regression basically fits the regression model by adding/dropping co-variates one at a time based on a specified criterion. Some of the most commonly used Stepwise regression methods are listed below:", "The aim of this modeling technique is to maximize the prediction power with minimum number of predictor variables.\u00a0It is one of the method to handle higher dimensionality of data set.", "Ridge Regression is a technique used when the data suffers from multicollinearity (independent variables are highly correlated). In multicollinearity, even though the least squares estimates (OLS) are unbiased, their variances are large which deviates the observed value far from the true value. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, ridge regression reduces the standard errors.", "Above, we saw\u00a0the equation for linear regression.\u00a0Remember? It can be represented as:", "This equation also has an error term. The complete equation becomes:", "In a linear equation, prediction errors can be decomposed into two sub components. First is\u00a0due to the biased and second is\u00a0due to the\u00a0variance.\u00a0Prediction error can occur due to any one of these two or\u00a0both components. Here, we\u2019ll discuss about the error caused due to variance.", "Ridge regression solves the multicollinearity problem through\u00a0shrinkage parameter \u03bb (lambda). Look at the equation below.", "In this equation, we have two components. First one is least square term and other one is lambda of the summation of\u00a0\u03b22 (beta- square) where\u00a0\u03b2 is the coefficient. This is added to least square term in order to shrink the parameter to have a very low variance.", "Similar to Ridge Regression, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) also penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients. In addition, it is capable of reducing the variability and improving the accuracy of linear regression models. \u00a0Look at the equation below:\u00a0Lasso regression differs from ridge regression in a way that\u00a0it uses\u00a0absolute values in the penalty function, instead of squares. This leads to\u00a0penalizing (or equivalently constraining the sum of the absolute values of the estimates) values\u00a0which causes\u00a0some of the parameter estimates to turn out exactly zero. Larger the penalty applied, further the estimates get\u00a0shrunk towards absolute zero. This\u00a0results to variable selection out of given n variables.", "ElasticNet is hybrid of Lasso and Ridge Regression techniques.\u00a0It\u00a0is trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer.\u00a0Elastic-net is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random, while elastic-net is likely to pick both.", "A practical advantage of trading-off between Lasso and Ridge is that, it allows Elastic-Net to inherit some of Ridge\u2019s stability under rotation.", "Beyond these 7\u00a0most commonly used regression techniques, you can also look at other models like Bayesian, Ecological and Robust regression.", "Life is usually simple, when you know only one or two techniques. One of the training institutes I know of tells their students \u2013 if the outcome is continuous \u2013 apply linear regression. If it is binary \u2013 use logistic regression! However, higher the number of options available at our disposal, more difficult it becomes to choose the right one. A similar case happens with regression models.", "Within\u00a0multiple types\u00a0of regression models, it is important to choose the best suited technique\u00a0based on type of independent and dependent variables, dimensionality in the data and other essential characteristics of the data. Below are the key factors that you should practice to select the\u00a0right\u00a0regression model:", "Now, its time to take the plunge and actually play with some other real datasets. Try the techniques learnt in this post on the datasets provided in the following practice problems and let us know in the comment section how it worked out for you!", "By now, I hope you would have got an overview of regression. These regression techniques should be applied considering the conditions of data. One of the best trick to find out which technique to use, is by checking the family of variables, i.e., discrete or continuous.", "In this article, I discussed about 7 types of regression and some key facts associated with each technique. As somebody who\u2019s new in this industry, I\u2019d advise you to learn these techniques and later implement them in your models.
