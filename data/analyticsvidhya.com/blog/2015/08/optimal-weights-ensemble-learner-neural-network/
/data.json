The ability to train multiple learners on a set of hypothesis, not only adds robustness to the model, but also enables it to deliver highly accurate predictions. In case you missed, I would recommend reading\u00a0Basics of Ensemble Learning Explained in Simple English\u00a0before you go forward.", "While building ensemble models,\u00a0one of most common challenge that people face is to find optimal weights.\u00a0Few of them fight hard to solve this challenge and the not so\u00a0brave ones, convince themselves to apply simple bagging, which assumes equal weight for all models and takes the average of all predicted values.", "It often works well because it removes variance error from individual models. However, as we know, assigning\u00a0equal weights is not the best approach to obtain the\u00a0best combination of models. What could be an alternate way?\u00a0In this article, I\u2019ve solved the problem\u00a0of finding out the optimal weights in ensemble learners using neural network in R Programming.", "Imagine you have built 3 models on a given (hypothetical) data set. Each of these models predicts probability of output for an event.", "In the following figure : Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3 are the three predictive models. Each of them have their own uniqueness and can work as a team to perform even better than individually best model.", "We initially assume a 33.33% weight for each of the model and build an Ensemble model. Here, the challenge is to optimize these weights w1, w2 and w3 in such a fashion as to build a highly powerful ensemble model.", "Assume p1 , p2 and p3 are three outputs from the three models respectively. We need to optimize w1, w2 and w3 to optimize an objective function. Let\u2019s try to write down the constraints and objective function mathematically :", "Objective function (Maximize Likelihood function) :", "This is a classic case of simplex optimization. However, with a huge number of models to bag, and diving into mathematical formulas every time can be stressful and time consuming at times. Hence,\u00a0we need a smarter method here.", "We\u2019ll now learn to find\u00a0these weights without getting into such mathematical formulation using neural network implementation.", "I understand,\u00a0neural network implementation can be quite overwhelming at times. Hence, to solve the\u00a0current case in hand, we\u2019ll\u00a0not deep dive into the complex concepts of\u00a0deep neural network.", "Basically, neural network operates on finding weights for interlink between ( input variable to\u00a0hidden node) and ( hidden node to output node). Our objective here is to\u00a0find the right combination of weights from input nodes directly to the output node.", "Here is an easy and diligent\u00a0way\u00a0to accomplish this task. We restrict the number of hidden nodes to one. This will automatically adjust the weight from hidden node to output node as 1. This implies that\u00a0the hidden node and the output node is no longer different.", "Here is a simplistic schema to represent what we just discussed :", "So we found a way! This will automatically accomplish\u00a0what we were trying to do using simplex equations.\u00a0Let\u2019s put this formulation down to a R code", "I have implemented\u00a0this logic on multiple Kaggle problems and found that the results are quite encouraging.
