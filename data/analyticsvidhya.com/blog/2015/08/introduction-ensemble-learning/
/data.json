For the purpose of this article, I will cover the basic concepts and ideas of ensemble modeling. This should be enough for you to start building ensembles at your own end. As usual, we have tried to keep things as simple as possible.", "Let\u2019s quickly start with an example to understand the basics of Ensemble learning. This example will bring out, how we use ensemble model every day without realizing that we are using ensemble modeling.", "Example: I want to invest in a company XYZ. I am not sure about its performance though. So, I look for\u00a0advice on whether the stock price will increase more than 6% per annum or not? I decide to approach various\u00a0experts having\u00a0diverse\u00a0domain experience:", "1. Employee of Company XYZ: This person knows the internal functionality of the company and have the insider information about the functionality of the firm. But he lacks a broader perspective on how are competitors innovating, how is the technology evolving and what will be the impact of this evolution on Company XYZ\u2019s product. In the past, he has been\u00a0right 70% times.", "2. Financial Advisor of Company XYZ: This person has a broader perspective on how companies strategy will fair of in this competitive environment. However, he lacks a view\u00a0on how the company\u2019s internal policies are fairing off. In the past, he has been\u00a0right 75% times.", "3. Stock Market Trader: This person has observed the company\u2019s stock price over past 3 years. He knows the seasonality trends and how the overall market is performing. He also has developed a strong intuition on how stocks might vary over time. In the past, he has been\u00a0right 70% times.", "4. Employee of a competitor: This person knows the internal functionality of the competitor firms and is aware of certain changes which are yet to be brought. He lacks a sight of company in focus and the external factors which can relate the growth of competitor with the company of subject. In the past, he has been right \u00a060% of times.", "5. Market Research team in same segment: This team analyzes the customer preference of company XYZ\u2019s product over others and how is this changing with time.

In the above example, the way we combine all the predictions together will be termed as Ensemble Learning.", "In this article, we will talk about a few ensemble techniques widely used in the industry. Before we get into techniques, let\u2019s first understand how do we actually get different set of learners. Models can be different from each other for a variety of reasons, starting from the population they are built upon to the modeling used for building the model.", "Here are the top 4 reasons for\u00a0a model to be different. They can be different because of a mix of these factors as well:", "The error emerging from\u00a0any model can be broken down into three components mathematically. Following are these component :", "Why is this important in the current context? To understand what really goes behind an ensemble model, we need to first understand what causes error in the model. We will briefly introduce you to these errors and give an insight to each ensemble learner in this regards.", "Bias error is useful to quantify how much on an average are the predicted values different from the actual value. A high bias error means we have a under-performing model which keeps on missing important trends.", "Variance on the other side quantifies how are the prediction made on same observation different from each other. A high variance model will over-fit on your training population and perform badly on any observation beyond training. Following diagram will give you more clarity (Assume that red spot is the real value and blue dots are predictions) :", "Normally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias in the model. However, this only happens till a particular point. As you continue to make your model more complex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance.", "A champion model should maintain a balance between these two types of errors. This is known as the trade-off management of bias-variance errors.\u00a0Ensemble learning is one way to execute this trade off analysis.", "1.\u00a0Bagging : Bagging tries to implement similar learners on small sample populations and then takes a mean of all the predictions. In generalized bagging, you can use different learners on different population. \u00a0As you can expect this helps us to reduce the variance error.", "2. Boosting : Boosting is an iterative technique which adjust the weight of an observation based on the last classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However, they may sometimes over fit on the training data.", "3. Stacking : This is a very interesting way of combining models. Here we use a learner to combine output from different learners. This can lead to decrease in either bias or variance error depending on the combining learner we use.", "Ensemble techniques are being\u00a0used in every Kaggle Problem. Choosing the right ensembles is more of an art than straight forward science. With experience, you will develop\u00a0a knack of which ensemble learner to use in different kinds of scenario and base learners.", "Did you enjoy reading this article?
