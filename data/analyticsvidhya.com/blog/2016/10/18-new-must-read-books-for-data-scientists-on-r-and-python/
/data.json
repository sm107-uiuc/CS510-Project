It\u2019s how people install new software into their brain\u201d", "Personally, I haven\u2019t learnt as much from videos & online tutorials as much I\u2019ve learnt from books. Until this very moment, my tiny wooden shelf has enough books to keep me busy this winter.", "Understanding machine learning & data science is easy. There are numerous open courses which you can take up right now and get started.\u00a0But, acquiring in-depth knowledge of a subject requires extra effort.\u00a0For example: You might quickly understand how does a random forest work, but understanding the logic\u00a0behind it\u2019s working would require extra efforts.", "The confidence of questioning the logic comes from reading books. Some people easily accept the status quo. On the other hand, some curious ones\u00a0challenge & say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be done the other way?\u201d That\u2019s where such people discover new ways of executing a task. Almost, every data scientist I\u2019ve come across in person, on AMAs, on published interviews, each one of them have emphasized the inevitable role of books in their lives.", "Here is a list of books on doing machine learning / data science in R and Python which I\u2019ve come across in last one year. Since reading is a good habit, with this post, I want pass this habit to you. For each book, I\u2019ve written a summary to help you judge its relevance. Happy reading!", "Disclosure:\u00a0The amazon links in this article are affiliate links. If you buy a book through this link, we would get paid through Amazon. This is one of the ways for us to cover our costs while we continue to create these awesome articles. Further, the list reflects our recommendation based on content of book and is no way influenced by the commission.", "This book is written by Garrett Grolemund. It is best suited for people new to R. Learning to write functions & loops empowers you to do much more in R, than just juggling with packages. People think, R packages can let them avoid writing functions & loops, but it isn\u2019t a sustainable approach. This book\u00a0introduces you to details of R programming environment using interesting projects like weighted dice, playing cards, slot machine etc. The book language is simple to understand and examples can be reproduced easily.", "This book is written by Jared P. Lander. It\u2019s a decent book covering all aspects of data science such as data visualization, data manipulation, predictive modeling, but not in as much depth. You can understand as, it covers a wide breath of topic and misses out on details of each.\u00a0Precisely, it emphasizes on the usage criteria of algorithms and one example each showing its implementation in R. This books should be brought by people who are more inclined towards understand practical side of algorithms.", "This book is written by Teetor Paul.\u00a0It comprises of several tips, recipes to help people overcome daily struggles in data pre-processing and manipulation. Many a times, we are stuck in a situation where we know very well, what needs to be done. But, how it needs to be done becomes a mammoth challenge. This books solves the problem. It doesn\u2019t have theoretical explanation of concepts, but focuses on how to use them in R. It covers a wide range of topics such as probability, statistics, time series analysis, data pre-processing etc.", "This book is written by\u00a0Winston Chang. Data visualization enables a person to express & analyze their findings using\u00a0shapes & colors, not just in tables. Having a solid\u00a0understanding of charts, when to use which chart, how to customize a chart and make it look good, is a key skill of a data scientist. This book doesn\u2019t bore you with theoretical knowledge, but focuses on building them in R using sample data sets. It focuses on ggplot2 package to undertake all visualization activities.\u00a0", "This book is written by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. Max Kuhn is none other than creator of caret package too. It\u2019s one of the best book comprising a blend of theoretical and practical knowledge. It discusses several crucial machine learning topics such as over-fitting, feature selection, linear & non-linear models, trees methods etc. Needless to say, it demonstrates all these algorithms using caret package. Caret is one of the powerful ML package contributed in CRAN library.", "This book is written by a team of authors including Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It is one of the most detailed book on statistical modeling. Also, it\u2019s available for free. It comprises of in-depth explanation of topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, trees, SVM, unsupervised learning etc. Since it\u2019s the introduction, the explanations are quite easy and any newbie can easily follow it. Thus, I recommended this book to all people who are new to machine learning in R. In addition, several practice exercises in this book just adds cherry on top.", "This book is written by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman.\u00a0This is the next part of \u2018Introduction to Statistical Learning\u2019. It comprises of more\u00a0advanced topics, therefore I would suggest you not to directly jump to it. This book in best suited for people familiar with basics of machine learning. It talks about shrinkage methods, different linear methods for regression, classification, kernel smoothing, model selection etc. It\u2019s a must read book for people who want to understand ML in depth.", "This book is written by Brett Lantz. I am impressed by the simplicity of this author\u2019s way of explaining concepts. It\u2019s a book on machine learning which is easy to understand, and would provide you a lot of knowledge about their practical aspects too. Algorithms such as Bagging, Boosting, SVM, Neural Network, Clustering etc are discussed by solving respective case studies. These case studies will help you understand the real world usage of these algorithms. In addition, knowledge of ML\u00a0parameters is also discussed.", "This book is written by Cory Lesmeister. It is best suited for everyone who want to master R for machine learning purposes. It comprises of all (almost) algorithms and their execution in R. Alongside, this book will introduce you to several R packages used for ML including the recently launched H2o package. It\u2019s a book which features latest advancements in ML forte, hence I\u2019d suggest it to be read by every R user. However, you can\u2019t expect to learn advanced ML techniques like Stacking from this book.", "This book is written by Drew Conway and John Myles White. It\u2019s a relatively shorter book than others, but aptly brings out sheer importance of every topic discussed. After reading this book, I realized that the author\u2019s mindset is not to go deep in a topic, still making sure to cover important details. For enhanced understanding, the author also demonstrates several used cases, while solving which, explains the underlying methods too. It\u2019s a good read for everyone who\u2019d like to learn something new about ML.", "This book is written by Nina Zumel & John Mount. As the name suggests, this book focuses on using data science methods in real world. It\u2019s different in itself. None of the books listed above, talks about real world challenges in model building, model deployment, but it does. The author doesn\u2019t move her focus from establishing a connect between theoretical world of ML and its impact on real world activities. It\u2019s a must read for freshers who are yet to enter analytics industry.", "This book is written by Samir Madhavan. This book starts with an introduction to data structures in\u00a0Numpy & Pandas and provides a useful description of importing data from various sources into these structures.\u00a0You will learn\u00a0to perform linear algebra in Python and make analysis by using inferential statistics. Later, the book takes onto the advanced concepts like building a recommendation engine, high-end visualization using Python, ensemble modeling etc.", "Want to get started with data analysis with Python? Get your hands on this data analysis guide by W Mckinney, the main author of Pandas library. There isn\u2019t any online course as comprehensive as this book.\u00a0This book\u00a0covers all aspects of data analysis from manipulating, processing, cleaning, visualization and crunching data in Python. If you are a new to data science python, it\u2019s a must read for you. It\u2019s power-packed with case studies from various\u00a0domains.", "This book is written by Andreas Muller and Sarah Guido.
