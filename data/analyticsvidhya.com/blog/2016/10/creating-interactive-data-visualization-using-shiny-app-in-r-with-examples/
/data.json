Also, it is very difficult to create an interactive visualization for story narration using above packages.\u00a0These problems can be resolved by dynamically creating interactive plots in R using Shiny with minimal effort.", "If you use R, chances are that you might have come across Shiny. It is an open package from RStudio, used to build interactive web pages with R. It provides a very powerful way to share your analysis in an interactive manner with the community. The best part about shiny is that you don\u2019t need any knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript to get started.", "Today, I will walk you through all the steps involved in creating a shiny app as well as deploying it online to make it accessible to everyone. This article will provide you a good understanding n how shiny apps work and how they can be useful. To provide you a hands on experience on creating Shiny Apps on your own I will be using the Loan Prediction III Practice Problem. And am sure by the end of this article you will be able to create Shiny apps yourself.", "Note: This article requires basic knowledge of R language.", "Shiny is an open package from RStudio, which provides a web application framework to create interactive web applications (visualization) called \u201cShiny apps\u201d. The ease of working with Shiny has what popularized it among R users. These web applications seamlessly display R objects (like plots, tables etc.) and can also be made live to allow access to anyone.", "Shiny provides automatic reactive binding between inputs and outputs which we will be discussing in the later parts of this article. It also provides extensive pre-built widgets which make it possible to build elegant and powerful applications with minimal effort.", "Any shiny app is built using two components:", "1.UI.R: This file creates the user interface in a shiny application.

The server.R is written in the form of a function which maps input(s) to the output(s) by some set of logical operations. The inputs taken in ui.R file are accessed using $ operator (input$InputName). The outputs are also referred using the $ operator (output$OutputName). We will be discussing a few examples of server.R in the coming sections of the article for better understanding.", "The shiny apps which you have created can be accessed and used by anyone only if, it is deployed on the web.\u00a0You can host your shiny application on \u201cShinyapps.io\u201d.

Here are few additional resources for you to become an adept in creating Shiny Apps.", "I hope you enjoyed reading the article.
