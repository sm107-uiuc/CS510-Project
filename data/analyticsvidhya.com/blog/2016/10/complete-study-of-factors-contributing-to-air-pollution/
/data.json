In 2010, about 620,000 early deaths in India occurred from air pollution-related diseases. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) sponsored\u00a0the study that links the pollutants, pm 10 (particulate matter smaller than 10 microns), the cause of these\u00a0diseases.

In addition to this, Narain points out, 18 million years of healthy lives are lost due to illness burden that enhances the economic cost of pollution. Half of these deaths have been caused by ischemic heart disease triggered by exposure to air pollution and the rest due to stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory track infection and lung cancer.", "We feel, if we closely study the Air Quality Data, we should be able to identify patterns (spike in air pollution levels) and identify correlating factors on key levels of Air Pollution across New Delhi. Also as part of the exercise, we wanted to study the impact of Government sponsored Initiatives like \u2018Odd-Even\u2019 Pilot Project Phase II. The Phase I of the \u2018Odd- Even\u2019 experiment was a huge success in terms of people compliance and reduction of traffic congestion, it had very little impact on the Air Pollution levels during the Campaign period.", "It is also important to understand the behaviour of meteorological parameters in the planetary boundary layer because, atmosphere is the medium in which air pollutants are transported away from the source, which is governed by the meteorological parameters such as atmospheric wind speed, wind direction, and temperature.", "Air pollutants are being let out into the atmosphere from a variety of sources, and the concentration of pollutants in the ambient air depends not only on the quantities that are emitted but also the ability of the atmosphere, either to absorb or disperse these pollutants.", "There were conflicting reports in media on the actual cause of air pollution in New Delhi. Some sections claimed vehicles as the main source of pollution, while others held road dust & construction debris responsible.
