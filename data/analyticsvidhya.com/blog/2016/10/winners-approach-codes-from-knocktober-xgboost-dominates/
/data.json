It was one of the most challenging and intimidating competitions on Analytics Vidhya. We saw top data scientists from across the world using best of their knowledge to secure top position on the leaderboard.", "We launched the competition on 21 Oct\u201916 midnight\u00a0with over 2275 participants.\u00a0At the time of launching this competition, we promised that you will be provoked to question your machine learning skills. And we bet you did. The competition ended on 23 oct\u201916 leaving everyone clueless about private leaderboard ranks.", "The winners of the competition have generously shared their detailed approach and codes they used in the competition. XGBoost, Python & GBM were widely used in\u00a0the competition. But, it was the combination of best features and prudent validation technique which won the competition.", "For all those who didn\u2019t participate in this competition, you\u2019ve missed out on\u00a0one of the best opportunities. Nevertheless, there\u2019s always a next time. Stay tuned for upcoming hackathons.", "Medcamp, is a not for profit organisation which organizes health camps in cities with low work-life balance. It was started in 2006 and its core mission is to help people maintain a balanced work-life. For four years, they have conducted 65 health camps in various cities. But they are facing a big problem in their effective business operations. And they want data scientists to provide them a solution.", "Medcamp is incurring losses. Every year they see a huge drop in\u00a0the number of people registering for the camp and the ones actually taking test at the camp.", "The irregularity in the number of people showing at the camp creates a big problem for them. If the number of people taking the test is less than the total number of registration, then the company incurs loss of unnecessary inventories. And if, the number of people visiting the camp is more than the number of registration, then it can lead to shortage of inventory and thus, a bad experience for the people.", "To tackle this problem, Medcamp has provided the total number of registrations\u00a0from past 4 years and\u00a0want data scientists to provide them insights from the data.\u00a0The evaluation metric used was AUC ROC.", "Knocktober ended on a pleasant note, leaving everyone inquisitive to know what the final results will reveal. And when we announced\u00a0the Top 3 ranks, not just the participants but even we were surprised. Here are the Top 3 rankers and it was definitely not an easy win.", "Rank 1 : Sudalai Rajkumar & Rohan Rao", "Rank 2 : Naveen Kumar Kaveti & Suprit Saha", "Here are the final rankings of all the participants at the\u00a0leaderboard.", "All the Top 3 winners have shared their detailed approach & code from the competition. I am sure you are eager to know their secrets, go ahead.", "Sonny Laskar is a data science expert currently heading the IT Operations Analytics wing at Microland. He often participates in machine learning challenges to test his expertise. Here\u2019s what Sonny says:", "Even though it was a binary classification problem, the data was not present in the standard labeled format. Hence many were confused as to what is the actual problem.", "Another interesting thing was the \u201cNo IDs please\u201d clause. Recently, we have observed that some competitions in Analytics Vidhya and Kaggle turned out to a leak \u2013 exploration\u00a0problem which at the end of the day is of very less value to the client. Hence any leak exploration is strictly discouraged.", "As always, I started with a few visualizations. Below are few of the plots:", "Like others, I also had created few time-based features. The ratio of the days left for the event to end to the duration of the camp was an interesting feature that worked for me. Another interesting feature was how many\u00a0days have elapsed between the previous registrations by the same patient.", "Plots above\u00a0show that the 1\u2019s occurred\u00a0more if the patient registered for the event much closer to the event start date. May be as days pass, the patient loses interest.", "In my experience, tree-based models work better than linear models in such data sets. Hence I started with Xgboost, the universally accepted tree-based algo. Surprisingly, RandomForest didn\u2019t work as well , might be because I didn\u2019t tune that well. GBM performed\u00a0slightly better than Xgboost.", "I created two bags for both Xgboost and GBM and did a final rank average ensemble of the scores.", "This competition reminded me of the thumb rule:", "Naveen Kumar Kaveti and Suprit Saha are both statistical analyst at Walmart Labs, India. Naveen and Suprit are both data science enthusiasts and often participates in competitions to test their\u00a0skills.\u00a0Here\u2019s what they shared:", "Initially we generated numerous features but later realized that some of them are performing very well in the train set but they are adding noise in the test set. In this competition we mainly focused on feature engineering rather than algorithm selection.", "We built different models like logistic regression, random forest, xgboost and GBM (in h2o package) using our initial set of features and observed that, there is a significant difference between cross validation score and public leaderboard score. We realized that some of the features in train set have different distribution in test set then we started our hunt for finding out the variables, which are adding noise in the test set.", "To start with, we compared the distribution of variables across test and train and then we validated our results against public leaderboard score to find out noise variables.", "After eliminating noise variables, we tried aforementioned models again and among those GBM was outperforming others. Using only GBM we reached 8th position in the public leaderboard after that we tried different ensemble methods but none of them increased the score in public leaderboard.", "Key learning from this competition is that, feature engineering is one of the most important part of modeling, probably much more than the choice of algorithm. This competition reminds us the famous quote by George Box \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful\u201d. I think here the useful ones are the one with good set of features.", "The major key for our success in this competition is elimination of noise variables and adding relevant features.", "Some of the features, which helped us in pushing leaderboard score:", "Sudalai Rajkumar is a lead data scientist at Freshdesk and Rohan Rao is a lead data scientist at AdWyze. Their profound knowledge and deep understanding of machine learning concepts\u00a0is truly inspiring. Here\u2019s what they shared:", "Our approach was to explore the data independently and merge our models towards the end to generate a strong ensemble.", "I started off with a camp based 5 fold-cross validation where camps were disjoint among the folds. This worked\u00a0decently for me. If there was a substantial increase in my CV score, there was some improvement in my LB score as well though not in the same magnitude. But one thing I realised was that I will not be able to create time based features in this methodology since this might cause a future leakage. From the data exploration, we can see that train and test are separated not only by camps but also by time. So, I created a validation set using the rows from the last few camps given in the training set and used the rest as development sample.", "One thing I cherished a lot in this competition is feature engineering. Since I had some good amount of time during this hackathon unlike the recent ones, I spent time creating variables, checking the performance and then adding / discarding them.", "To start with, I ran an xgboost model using all the variables and checked the variable importance. I discarded those features with low variable importance (A trick learned from Rohan!). Removing those did not affect the cv scores and public LB score.", "Then I started creating additional variables. The ones that are included in my model and the reasoning for including the same are as follows:", "1. Duration of the camp in days \u2013 if the duration is long, then more people might attend", "2. Date difference between camp start date and registration date \u2013 If the person register close to the camp start date, then the chance of turning up for the camp is quite high.", "3. Date difference between camp end date and registration date \u2013 Some registration dates fall after camp start date as well. So to understand whether registration is done well ahead of the final day of the camp.", "4. Date difference between registration and first interaction \u2013 Frequent interactions might help gain more popularity for the camps.", "5. Date difference between camp start date and first interaction \u2013 Very similar to the reasoning of (2).", "6. Number of times the patient registered for a camp \u2013 To capture the individual characteristics.", "7. Number of patients registered for the given health camp \u2013 To capture the camp characteristics.", "8. Date difference between current registration date and the previous registration date \u2013 If the difference is a shorter time span, then there might be a higher chance to attend.", "9. Date difference between current registration date and the next registration date \u2013 Same reasoning as that of previous one.", "10. Mean outcome of the patient till the given date \u2013 To capture the historical patient outcome characteristics.", "11. Format of the previous camp attended \u2013 To capture if the patient attends any particular format of camps.", "12. Sum of donations given by the patient till the given date \u2013 If a patient donates more, then there might be a chance that the person is interested in attending the camps.", "13. Total number of stalls visited by the patient till the given date \u2013 If a\u00a0patient visits more stalls, then the chance of attending the camps might be high.", "Variables that did not help me improve the score are:", "1. Different ratio variables on the date i.e. one date differences divided by another.", "2. Ratio variables using age, income and education.", "3. Mean health score values of the previously attended camps.", "4. Last known outcome value for the patient.", "5. Bayesian encoding on categorical variables.", "The reason could be that they were not really helpful or this information was already captured by some other variables present above.", "My final model was an xgboost which scored 0.8389 in public leaderboard and I bagged them thrice to get 0.8392.", "As I was busy at the World Sudoku/Puzzle Championships, I had very less time in this hackathon. Hence, I decided to focus on building a tangential different model with features so as to blend well with SRK\u2019s.", "I spent 95% of my time in exploring the data and engineering features. I did not even have time to tune my parameters, so, stuck with the set I started with. I went with a minimalistic approach, carefully choosing the most effective features, which gave stable CV and LB scores.", "I used the following raw features:", "These mainly capture metadata on the camps and the patients.", "The following engineered features boosted my model\u2019s performance:", "7. Start_Date_Diff: Difference between start date of camp and registration date of patient.", "8. End_Date_Diff: Difference between end date of camp and registration date of patient.", "9. Prev_Date_Diff: Difference between registration date of patient and previous registration date of the patient.", "10: Next_Date_Diff: Difference between registration date of patient and next registration date of the patient.", "11. Count_Patient: Number of camps a patient registered.", "12. Count_Patient_Date: Number of camps a patient registered on each date.", "13. Donation_Flag: Binary indicator if the patient made a donation in the past.", "Using the raw date features isn\u2019t a good idea since the test data is split on time, hence, converting the date features into date differences was very useful.", "I found that patients who donated had a higher response rate than other patients, and thats how donation_flag helped the model.", "The other features are similar to SRK\u2019s, which describe characteristics of the timing and patient.", "My final model was an XGBoost with these 13 variables. I also subsetted the data, excluding observations in 2003 and 2004, and ones where the registration date was missing.", "We checked the correlation of our best performing models and to our surprise it was 0.93 \u2013 low correlation for a second level input, given both of us used the same modelling algorithm \u2013 XGBoost. The varied set of features in our base models is the reason for this. Hence we averaged both our models together to get to 0.8432 in the public leaderboard, which proved to be stable and robust, as we finished 1st on the public as well as the final private leaderboard.", "On working together as a team", "Sudalai:\u00a0Rohan was very busy during the weekend with his World Championships. Inspite of his busy schedule, he managed to squeeze some time and create an awesome model with very few features and varied from my model. Salutes and thanks to him! It is always a great learning experience working with Rohan and look forward to the same in the future as well.", "Rohan:\u00a0It was fun and interesting to work with Sudalai, and our ensemble made a considerable difference at the end, which got us the win. Really happy with our team-work and performance. Thanks to SRK for all the help and support!", "Below are the key learnings from this competition:", "As we come to the end of this article, I am sure you will agree with me that it was an incredible competition.
