Continuing the series of articles on neural network libraries, I have decided to throw light on Keras \u2013 supposedly the best deep learning library so far.", "I have been working on deep learning for sometime now and according to me, the most difficult thing when dealing with Neural Networks is the never-ending range of parameters to tune. With increase in depth\u00a0of a Neural Network, it becomes increasingly difficult to take care of all the parameters. Mostly, people rely on intuition and experience to tune it. In reality, research is still rampant on this topic.", "Thankfully we have Keras, which takes care of a lot of this\u00a0hard work and provides an easier interface!", "In this article, I am going to share my experience of working in deep learning. We will begin with an overview of Keras, its features and differentiation over other libraries. We will then, look at a simple implementation of neural networks in Keras. And then, I will take you through a hands-on exercise on parameter tuning in neural networks.", "Keras is a high level library, used specially for building neural network models. It is written in Python and is compatible with both Python \u2013 2.7 & 3.5. Keras was specifically developed for fast execution of ideas.\u00a0It has a simple and highly modular interface, which makes it easier to create even complex neural network models. This library abstracts low level libraries, namely Theano and TensorFlow so that, the user is free from \u201cimplementation details\u201d of these libraries.", "The key features of Keras are:", "Being a high level library and its simpler interface, Keras certainly shines as one of the best deep learning library available.\u00a0Few features of Keras, which stands out in comparison with other libraries are:", "Given the above reasons, it is no surprise that Keras is increasingly becoming popular as a deep learning library.", "Neural networks is a special type of machine learning (ML) algorithm. So, like every ML algorithm, it follows the usual ML workflow of data preprocessing, model building and model evaluation. For the sake of conciseness, I have listed out a To-D0 list of how to approach a Neural Network problem.", "Before starting this experiment, make sure you have Keras installed in your system. Refer the official installation guide. We will use tensorflow for backend, so make sure you have this done in your config file. If not, follow the steps given here.", "Here, we solve our deep learning practice problem \u2013\u00a0Identify the Digits.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at our problem statement:", "Our problem is an image recognition problem, to identify digits from a given 28 x 28 image. We have a subset of images for training and the rest for testing our model. So first, download the train and test files. The dataset contains a zipped file of all the images and both the train.csv and test.csv have the name of corresponding train and test images. Any additional features are not provided in the datasets, just the raw images are provided in \u2018.png\u2019 format.", "a) Import all the necessary libraries", "b) Let\u2019s set a seed value, so that we can control our models randomness", "c) The first step is to set directory paths, for safekeeping!", "a) Now let us read our datasets. These are in .csv formats, and have a filename along with the appropriate labels", "b) Let us see what our data looks like! We read our image and display it.", "c) The above image is represented as numpy array, as seen below", "d) For easier data manipulation, let\u2019s store all our images as numpy arrays", "e) As this is a typical ML problem, to test the proper functioning of our model we create a validation set. Let\u2019s take a split size of 70:30 for train set vs validation set", "a) Now comes the main part! Let us define our neural network architecture. We define a neural network with 3 layers \u00a0input, hidden and output. The number of neurons in input and output are fixed, as the input is our 28 x 28 image and the output is a 10 x 1 vector representing the class. We take 50 neurons in the hidden layer. Here, we use Adam as our optimization algorithms, which is an efficient variant of Gradient Descent algorithm. There are a number of other optimizers available in keras (refer here). In case you don\u2019t understand any of these terminologies, check out the article on fundamentals of neural network to know more in depth of how it works.", "b) It\u2019s time to train our model", "a) To test our model with our own eyes, let\u2019s visualize its predictions", "b) We see that our model performs well even on being very simple. Now we create a submission with our model", "I feel that, hyperparameter tuning is the hardest in neural network in comparison to any other machine learning algorithm. You would be insane to apply Grid Search, as there are numerous parameters when it comes to tuning a neural network.", "Note: I have discussed a few more details, on when to apply neural networks in the following article An Introduction to Implementing Neural Networks using TensorFlow", "Some important parameters to look out for while optimizing neural networks are:", "Also, there may be many more hyperparameters depending on the type of architecture. For example, if you use a convolutional neural network, you would have to look at hyperparameters like convolutional filter size, pooling value, etc.", "The best way to pick good parameters is to understand your problem domain. Research the previously applied techniques on your data, and most importantly \u00a0ask experienced people for insights to the problem. It\u2019s the only way you can try to ensure you get a \u201cgood enough\u201d neural network model.\n", "Here are some resources for tips and tricks for training neural networks. (Resource 1, Resource 2, Resource 3)", "Let us take our knowledge of hyperparameters and start tweaking our neural network model.", "This result blows your mind, doesn\u2019t it. Even with such small training time, the performance is way better! This proves that a better architecture can certainly boost your performance when dealing with neural networks.", "It\u2019s time to let go of the training wheels. There\u2019s many things you can try, so many tweaks to do. Try this on your end and let us know how it goes!", "Now, you have a basic overview of Keras and a hands-on experience of implementing neural networks.\u00a0There is still much more you can do. For example, I really like the implementation of keras to build image analogies. In this project, the authors train a neural network to understand an image, and recreate learnt attributes to another image. As seen below, the first two images are given as input, where the model trains on the first image and on giving input as second image, gives output as the third image.", "Neural network tuning is still considered as a \u201cdark art\u201d. So, don\u2019t expect that you would get the best model in your first try. Build, evaluate and reiterate, this is how you would be a better neural network practitioner.", "Another point you should know that there are other methods to ensure that you would get a \u201cgood enough\u201d neural network model without training it from scratch. Techniques like pre-training and transfer learning, are essential to know when you are implementing neural network models to solve real life problems.", "I hope you found this article helpful. Now, it\u2019s time for you to practice and read as much as you can. Good luck! If you have any recommendations / suggestions on neural networks,\u00a0I\u2019d love to interact with you in comments.
