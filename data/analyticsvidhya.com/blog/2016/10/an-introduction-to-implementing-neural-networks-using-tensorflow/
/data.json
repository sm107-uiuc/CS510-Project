From running competitions to open sourcing projects and paying big bonuses, people are trying every possible thing to tap into this limited pool of talent.", "Self driving engineers are being hunted by the big guns in automobile industry, as the industry stands on the brink of biggest disruption it faced in last few decades!", "If you are excited by\u00a0the prospects deep learning has to offer, but have not started your journey yet \u2013 I am here to enable it.\u00a0Starting with this article, I will\u00a0write a series of articles on deep learning covering the popular Deep Learning libraries and their hands-on implementation.", "In this article, I will introduce TensorFlow to you. After reading this article you will be able to understand\u00a0application of neural networks and use TensorFlow to solve a real life problem. This article will require you to know the basics of neural networks and have familiarity with programming. Although the code in this article is in python, I have focused on the concepts and stayed as language-agnostic as possible.", "An Introduction to Implementing Neural Networks using TensorFlow", "Neural Networks have been in the spotlight for quite some time now.\u00a0For a more detailed explanation on neural network and deep learning\u00a0read here.\u00a0Its \u201cdeeper\u201d versions are making tremendous breakthroughs in many fields such as image recognition, speech and natural language processing etc.", "The main question that arises is when to and when not to apply neural networks? This field is like a gold mine right now, with many discoveries uncovered everyday. And to be a part of this \u201cgold rush\u201d, you have to keep a few things in mind:", "Neural networks is a special type of machine learning (ML) algorithm. So as every ML algorithm, it follows the usual ML workflow of data preprocessing, model building and model evaluation. For the sake of conciseness, I have listed out a TO DO list of how to approach a Neural Network problem.", "For this article, I will be focusing on image data. So let us understand that first before we delve into TensorFlow.", "Images are mostly arranged as 3-D arrays, with the dimensions referring to height, width and color channel. For example, if you take a screenshot of your PC at this moment, it would be first convert into a 3-D array and then compress it \u00a0\u2018.jpeg\u2019 or \u2018.png\u2019 file formats.", "While these images are pretty easy to understand to a human, a computer has a hard time to understand them. This phenomenon is called \u201cSemantic gap\u201d. Our brain can look at the image and understand the complete picture in a few seconds.\u00a0On the other hand,\u00a0computer sees image as just an array of numbers. So the problem is how to we explain this image to the machine?", "In early days, people tried to break down the image into \u201cunderstandable\u201d format for the machine like a \u201ctemplate\u201d. For example, a face always has a specific structure which is somewhat preserved in every human, such as the position of eyes, nose or the shape of our face. But this method would be tedious, because when the number of objects to recognise would increase, the \u201ctemplates\u201d would not hold.", "Fast forward to 2012, a deep neural network architecture won the ImageNet challenge, a prestigious challenge to recognise objects from natural scenes. It continued to reign its sovereignty in all the upcoming ImageNet challenges, thus proving the usefulness to solve image problems.", "So which library / language do people normally use to solve image recognition problems? One recent survey I did that most of the popular deep learning libraries have interface for Python, followed by Lua, Java and Matlab. The most popular libraries, to name a few, are:", "Now, that \u00a0you understand how an image is stored and which are the common libraries used, let us look at what TensorFlow has to offer.", "Lets start with the official definition,", "\u201cTensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using dataflow graphs. Nodes in the graph represents mathematical operations, while graph edges represent multi-dimensional data arrays (aka tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.\u201d", "If that sounds a bit scary \u2013 don\u2019t worry. Here is my simple definition \u2013 look at TensorFlow as nothing but numpy with a twist. If you have worked on numpy before, understanding TensorFlow will be a piece of cake! A major difference between numpy and TensorFlow is that TensorFlow follows a lazy programming paradigm. It first builds a graph of all the operation to be done, and then when a \u201csession\u201d is called, it \u201cruns\u201d the graph. It\u2019s built to be scalable, by changing internal data representation to tensors (aka multi-dimensional arrays). Building a computational graph can be considered as the main ingredient of TensorFlow. To know more about mathematical constitution of a computational graph, read this article.", "It\u2019s easy to classify TensorFlow as a neural network library, but it\u2019s not just that. Yes, it was designed to be a powerful neural network library. But it has the power to do much more than that. You can build other machine learning algorithms on it such as decision trees or k-Nearest Neighbors. You can literally do everything you normally would do in numpy! It\u2019s aptly called \u201cnumpy on steroids\u201d", "The advantages of using TensorFlow are:", "Every library has its own \u201cimplementation details\u201d, i.e. a way to write which follows its coding paradigm. For example, when implementing scikit-learn, you first create object of the desired algorithm, then build a model on train and get predictions on test set, something like this:", "As I said earlier, TensorFlow follows a lazy approach. The usual workflow of running a program in TensorFlow is as follows:", "Lets write a small program to add two numbers!", "Note: We could have used a different neural network architecture to solve this problem, but for the sake of simplicity, we settle on feed forward multilayer perceptron with an in depth implementation.", "Let us remember what we learned about neural networks first.", "A typical implementation of Neural Network would be as follows:", "Here we solve our deep learning practice problem \u2013\u00a0Identify the Digits.\u00a0 Let\u2019s for a moment take a look at our problem statement.", "Our problem is an image recognition, to identify digits from a given 28 x 28 image. We have a subset of images for training and the rest for testing our model. So first, download the train and test files. The dataset contains a zipped file of all the images in the dataset and both the train.csv and test.csv have the name of corresponding train and test images. Any additional features are not provided in the datasets, just the raw images are provided in \u2018.png\u2019 format.", "As you know we will use TensorFlow to make a neural network model. So you should first install TensorFlow in your system. Refer the official installation guide for installation, as per your system specifications.", "We will follow the template as described above. Create a Jupyter notebook with python 2.7 kernel and follow the steps below.", "The above image is represented as numpy array, as seen below", "This will be the output of the above code", "And done! We just created our own trained neural network!", "Most of the above mentioned are in the sights of TensorFlow developers. They have made a roadmap for specifying how the library should be developed in the future.", "TensorFlow is built on similar principles as Theano and Torch of using mathematical computational graphs. But with the additional support of distributed computing, TensorFlow comes out to be better at solving complex problems. Also deployment of TensorFlow models is already supported which makes it easier to use for industrial purposes, giving a fight to commercial libraries such as Deeplearning4j, H2O and Turi. TensorFlow has APIs for Python, C++ and Matlab. There\u2019s also a recent surge for support for other languages such as Ruby and R. So, TensorFlow is trying to have a universal language support.", "So you saw how to build a simple neural network with TensorFlow. This code is meant for people to understand how to get started implementing TensorFlow, so take it with a pinch of salt. Remember that to solve more complex real life problems, you have to tweak the code a little bit.", "Many of the above functions can be abstracted to give a seamless end-to-end workflow. If you have worked with scikit-learn, you might know how a high level library abstracts \u201cunder the hood\u201d implementations to give end-users a more easier interface. Although TensorFlow has most of the implementations already abstracted, high level libraries are emerging such as TF-slim and TFlearn.", "I hope you found this article helpful.
