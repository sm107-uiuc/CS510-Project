I set myself on a journey to learn the basic steps for solving a Time Series problem and here I am sharing the same with you. These will definitely help you get a decent model in any future project you take up!", "Before going through this article, I highly recommend reading A Complete Tutorial on Time Series Modeling in R\u00a0and taking the free Time Series Forecasting course. It focuses on fundamental concepts and I will focus on using these concepts in solving a problem end-to-end along with codes in Python. Many resources exist for time series in R but very few are there for Python so I\u2019ll be using Python in this article.", "Are you a beginner looking for a place to start your data science journey? Here is a comprehensive course to assist you in your journey. Master Time Series, Machine Learning and Deep Learning through our Certified Blackbelt Program-", "As the name suggests, TS is a collection of data points collected at constant time intervals. These are analyzed to determine the long term trend so as to forecast the future or perform some other form of analysis. But what makes a TS different from say a regular regression problem? There are 2 things:", "Because of the inherent properties of a TS, there are various steps involved in analyzing it. These are discussed in detail below. Lets start by loading a TS object in Python. We\u2019ll be using the popular AirPassengers data set which can be downloaded here.", "Please note that the aim of this article is to familiarize you with the various techniques used for TS in general. The example considered here is just for illustration and I will focus on coverage a breadth of topics and not making a very accurate forecast.", "Pandas has dedicated libraries for handling TS objects, particularly the datatime64[ns]\u00a0class which stores time information and allows us to perform some operations really fast. Lets start by firing up the required libraries:", "Let\u2019s understand the arguments one by one:", "Now we can see that the data has time object as index and #Passengers as the column. We can cross-check the datatype of the index with the following command:", "Notice the dtype=\u2019datetime[ns]\u2019 which confirms that it is a datetime object.\u00a0As a personal preference, I would convert the column into a Series object to prevent referring to columns names every time I use the TS. Please feel free to use as a dataframe is that works better for you.", "Before going further, I\u2019ll discuss some indexing techniques for TS data. Lets start by selecting a particular value in the Series object. This can be done in following 2 ways:", "Both would return the value \u2018112\u2019 which can also be confirmed from previous output. Suppose we want all the data upto May 1949. This can be done in 2 ways:", "There are 2 things to note here:", "Consider another instance where you need all the values of the year 1949. This can be done as:", "The month part was omitted. Similarly if you all days of a particular month, the day part can be omitted.", "Now, lets move onto the analyzing the TS.", "A TS is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance remain constant over time. But why is it important? Most of the TS models work on the assumption that the TS is stationary. Intuitively, we can sat that if a TS has a particular behaviour over time, there is a very high probability that it will follow the same in the future. Also, the theories related to stationary series are more mature and easier to implement as compared to non-stationary series.", "Stationarity is defined using very strict criterion. However, for practical purposes we can assume the series to be stationary if it has constant statistical properties over time, ie. the following:", "I\u2019ll skip the details as it is very clearly defined in this article. Lets move onto the ways of testing stationarity. First and foremost is to simple plot the data and analyze visually. The data can be plotted using following command:", "It is clearly evident that there is an overall increasing trend in the data along with some seasonal variations. However, it might not always be possible to make such visual inferences (we\u2019ll see such cases later). So, more formally, we can check stationarity using the following:", "These concepts might not sound very intuitive at this point. I recommend going through the prequel article. If you\u2019re interested in some theoretical statistics, you can refer Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting\u00a0by Brockwell and Davis. The book is a bit stats-heavy, but if you have the skill to read-between-lines, you can understand the concepts and tangentially touch the statistics.", "Back to checking stationarity, we\u2019ll be using the rolling statistics plots along with Dickey-Fuller test results a lot so I have defined a function which takes a TS as input and generated them for us. Please note that I\u2019ve plotted standard deviation instead of variance to keep the unit similar to mean.", "The code is pretty straight forward. Please feel free to discuss the code in comments if you face challenges in grasping it.", "Let\u2019s run it for our input series:", "Though the variation in standard deviation is small, mean is clearly\u00a0increasing with time and this is not a stationary series. Also, the test statistic is way more than the critical values. Note that the signed values should be compared and not the absolute values.", "Next, we\u2019ll discuss the techniques that can be used to take this TS towards stationarity.", "Though stationarity assumption is taken in many TS models, almost none of practical time series are stationary. So statisticians have figured out ways to make series stationary, which we\u2019ll discuss now. Actually, its almost impossible to make a series perfectly stationary, but we try to take it as close as possible.", "Lets understand what is making a TS non-stationary. There are 2 major reasons behind non-stationaruty of a TS:1. Trend \u2013 varying mean over time. For eg, in this case we saw that on average, the number of passengers was growing over time.2. Seasonality \u2013 variations at specific time-frames. eg people might have a tendency to buy cars in a particular month because of pay increment or festivals.", "The underlying principle is to model or estimate the trend and seasonality in the series and remove those from the series to get a stationary series. Then statistical forecasting techniques can be implemented on this series. The final step would be to convert the forecasted values into the original scale by applying trend and seasonality constraints back.", "Note: I\u2019ll be discussing a number of methods. Some might work well in this case and others might not. But the idea is to get a hang of all the methods and not focus on just the problem at hand.", "Let\u2019s start by working on the trend part.", "One of the first tricks to reduce trend can be transformation. For example, in this case we can clearly see that the there is a significant positive trend. So we can apply transformation which penalize higher values more than smaller values. These can be taking a log, square root, cube root, etc. Lets take a log transform here for simplicity:", "In this simpler case, it is easy to see a forward trend in the data. But its not very intuitive in presence of noise. So we can use some techniques to estimate or model this trend and then remove it from the series. There can be many ways of doing it and some of most commonly used are:", "I will discuss smoothing here and you should try other techniques as well which might work out for other problems. Smoothing refers to taking rolling estimates, i.e. considering the past few instances. There are can be various ways but I will discuss two of those here.", "In this approach, we take average of \u2018k\u2019 consecutive values depending on the frequency of time series. Here we can take the average over the past 1 year, i.e. last 12 values. Pandas has specific functions defined for determining rolling statistics.", "The red line shows the rolling mean. Lets subtract this from the original series. Note that since we are taking average of last 12 values, rolling mean is not defined for first 11 values. This can be observed as:", "Notice the first 11 being Nan. Lets drop these NaN values and check the plots to test stationarity.", "This looks like a much better series. The rolling values appear to be varying slightly but there is no specific trend. Also, the test statistic is smaller than the 5% critical values so we can say with 95% confidence that this is a stationary series.", "However, a\u00a0drawback in this particular approach is that the time-period has to be strictly defined.\u00a0In this case\u00a0we can take yearly averages but in complex situations like forecasting a stock price, its difficult to come up with a number. So we take a \u2018weighted moving average\u2019 where more recent values are given a higher weight. There can be many technique for assigning weights.\u00a0A popular one is exponentially weighted moving average where weights are assigned to all the previous values with a decay factor. Find details here. This can be implemented in Pandas as:", "Note that here the parameter \u2018halflife\u2019 is used to define the amount of exponential decay. This is just an assumption here and would depend largely on the business domain. Other parameters like span and center of mass can also be used to define decay which are discussed in the link shared above. Now, let\u2019s remove this from series and check stationarity:", "This TS has even lesser variations in mean and standard deviation in magnitude. Also, the test statistic is smaller than the 1% critical value, which is better than the previous case. Note that in this case, there will be no missing values as all values from starting are given weights. So it\u2019ll work even with no previous values.", "The simple trend reduction techniques discussed before don\u2019t work in all cases, particularly the ones with high seasonality. Let\u2019s discuss two ways of removing trend and seasonality:", "One of the most common methods of dealing with both trend and seasonality is differencing. In this technique, we take the difference of the observation at a particular instant with that at the previous instant. This mostly works well in improving stationarity. First-order differencing can be done in Pandas as:", "This appears to have reduced trend considerably. Lets verify using our plots:", "We can see that the mean and std variations have small variations with time. Also, the Dickey-Fuller test statistic is less than the 10% critical value, thus the TS is stationary with 90% confidence. We can also\u00a0take second or third order differences which might get even better results in certain applications. I leave it to you to try them out.", "In this approach, both trend and seasonality are modeled separately and the remaining part of the series is returned. I\u2019ll skip the statistics and come to the results:", "Here we can see that the trend, seasonality are separated out from data and we can model the residuals. Lets check stationarity of residuals:", "The Dickey-Fuller test statistic is significantly lower than the 1% critical value. So this TS is very close to stationary. You can try advanced decomposition techniques as well which can generate better results. Also, you should note that converting the residuals into original values for future data in not very intuitive in this case.", "We saw different techniques and all of them worked reasonably well for making the TS stationary. Lets make model on the\u00a0TS after differencing as it is a very popular technique. Also, its\u00a0relatively easier to add noise and seasonality back into predicted residuals in this case. Having performed the trend and seasonality estimation techniques, there can be two situations:", "Let me give you a brief introduction to ARIMA. I won\u2019t go into the technical details but you should understand these concepts in detail if you wish to apply them more effectively. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages. The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is nothing but a linear (like a linear regression) equation. The predictors depend on the parameters (p,d,q) of the ARIMA model:", "An importance concern here is how to determine the value of \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019. We use two plots to determine these numbers. Lets discuss them first.", "The ACF and PACF plots for the TS after differencing can be plotted as:", "In this plot, the two dotted lines on either sides of 0 are the confidence interevals. These can be used to determine the \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019 values as:", "Now, lets make 3 different ARIMA models considering individual as well as combined effects. I will also print the RSS for each. Please note that here RSS is for the values of residuals and not actual series.", "We need to load the ARIMA model first:", "The p,d,q values can be specified using the order argument of ARIMA which take a tuple (p,d,q). Let model the 3 cases:", "Here we can see that the AR and MA models have almost the same RSS but combined is significantly better. Now, we are left with 1 last step, i.e. taking these values back to the original scale.", "Since the combined model gave best result, lets scale it back to the original values and see how well it performs there. First step would be to store the predicted results as a separate series and observe it.", "Notice that these start from \u20181949-02-01\u2019 and not the first month. Why? This is because we took a lag by 1 and first element doesn\u2019t have anything before it to subtract from. The way to convert the differencing to log scale is to add these differences consecutively to the base number. An easy way to do it is to first determine the cumulative sum at index and then add it to the base number. The cumulative sum can be found as:", "You can quickly do some back of mind calculations using previous output to check if these are correct. Next we\u2019ve to add them to base number. For this lets create a series with all values as base number and add the differences to it. This can be done as:", "Here the first element is base number itself and from thereon the values cumulatively added. Last step is to take the exponent and compare with the original series.", "That\u2019s all in Python.

Not a very good forecast I would say but you got the idea right? Now, I leave it upto you to refine the methodology further and make a better solution.", "Now, its time to take the plunge and actually play with some other real datasets. So are you ready to take on the challenge? Test the techniques discussed in this post and accelerate your learning in Time Series Analysis with the following Practice Problems:", "Through this article I have tried to give you a standard approach for solving time series problem. This couldn\u2019t have come at a better time as today is our Mini DataHack which will challenge you to solve a similar problem. We\u2019ve covered concepts of stationarity, how to take a time series closer to stationarity and finally forecasting the residuals.
