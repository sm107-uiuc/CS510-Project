Furthermore, this article\u00a0also explores the possibilities of leveraging a segment model approach using complex techniques like\u00a0stochastic gradient boosting or random forest into a simple logistic or linear regression framework (albeit to a very limited extent).", "Doing this, brings the essence of interaction effects in modeling process and replicated the advantages of complex techniques stated above.", "I could take you down in the depth of marketing to explain this concept. But, why\u00a0to complicate things\u00a0if they could be made simpler?", "So, I define Market Segmentation as,", "\u201cDividing the target market or customers on the basis of some significant features which could help a company sell more products in less marketing expenses.\u201d", "Companies have limited marketing budgets.

As mentioned above, they make use of market segmentation techniques. This ensures the product is positioned to the right segment of customers with\u00a0high propensity to buy.", "There are two broad set of methodologies for segmentation: Objective (supervised) and Non-Objective (unsupervised) segmentation methodologies. As the name indicates, a supervised methodology requires the objective to be stated as the basis for segmentation.", "Given below are some examples of objective and non-objective approaches.", "Hence, it is critical that the segments created on the basis of an objective segmentation methodology must be different with respect to the stated objective (e.g. response to an offer).", "However, in case of a non-objective methodology, the segments are different with respect to the \u201cgeneric profile\u201d of observations belonging to each segment, but not with regards to any specific outcome of interest.", "The most common techniques used for building an objective segmentation are CHAID and CRT. Each of these techniques attempt to maximize the difference among segments with regards to the stated objective (sometimes referred to as the target for segmentation). CHAID uses a chi square statistic for the same while CRT uses Gini impurity.", "The most common techniques for building non-objective segmentation are cluster analysis, K nearest neighbor techniques etc.", "Each of these techniques uses a distance measure (e.g. Euclidian distance, Manhattan distance, Mahalanobis distance etc.) This is done\u00a0to maximize the distance between the two segments. This\u00a0implies maximum difference between the segments with regards to a combination of all the variables (or factors).", "If you have thoroughly followed this article till here, we are now good to delve into the methodology adopted for creating segments. Of course, with the sole objective of building separate models for each segments.", "Here we\u2019ll build a logistic regression model for predicting likelihood of a customer to respond to an offer. A very similar approach can also be used for developing a linear regression model.\u00a0I\u2019ve discussed it in the following\u00a0section.", "Logistic regression: It uses\u00a01 or 0 indicator in the historical campaign data, which indicates\u00a0whether the customer has responded to the offer or not.", "Usually, one uses\u00a0the target (or \u2018Y\u2019 known as dependent variable) that has been identified for model development to undertake an\u00a0objective segmentation. Remember,\u00a0a separate model will be built for each segment. A segmentation scheme which provides the maximum difference between the segments with regards to the objective is usually selected. Below is a simple example of this approach.", "Fig-1: Sample segmentation for building a logistic regression \u2013 commonly adopted methodology", "The above segmentation scheme is the best possible objective segmentation developed, because the segments demonstrate the maximum separation with regards to the objectives (i.e. response rate).", "In the above tree, each separation should represent a statistically significant difference between the nodes with respect to the target. If a CHAID algorithm is used for developing the segmentation tree, then Chi Square value for each separation should be significantly different from zero (as measured by the \u201cp\u201d value of the separation).", "In addition, it is the common business intuition (which may not always have a sound statistical rationale), to develop separate models if the difference in response rates between adjacent node is at least 30% (e.g. if the response rate in a particular node is 0.7% and the same for the adjacent node is 0.5% then the difference in response rate is ~30%)", "The commonly adopted approach would suggest that one should build separate models for each of the terminal (or end) nodes, which have been depicted in green in Fig-1. But, is this the best approach from a modeling perspective? To answer that question, we need to find out a measure for evaluating a segmentation scheme from a modeling perspective.", "The most effective measure for evaluating a segmentation scheme for the purpose of building separate models is the lift in predictive power that can be achieved by building segmented models. The following example is\u00a0used to illustrate the same.", "Let us assume that a logistic model is developed on the entire population to predict the likelihood of response.", "Let us designate this as Model-1 (mostly analysts describe this as the parent model), let the Gini for this model be 0.57. Now as part of the segmented model development approach, five separate models are built, one for each end node (mostly analysts describe them as child models).", "After building 5 separate models, the score or the predicted probability is calculated for each observation (or record) and the 5 data sets (for each end node) are appended.", "The Gini of the combined data set is compared with the Gini of model-1. Then, the ratio of the two is designated as the lift in predictive power. For instance, if the Gini of the combined data set is 0.6, then the lift will be 1.05. It can be seen that, though segmentation is the best possible objective segmentation, yet it provides only 5% extra lift in predictive power.", "Let us find out why this may be the case. It should be noted that,\u00a0when\u00a0one is developing a linear model, the\u00a0lift in Adjusted R Square should be considered instead of lift in Gini.", "While building the overall model (Model-1), one can always use appropriate dummy variables to represent the segmentation. For instance, one can use the following dummies (it should be noted that due to degree of freedom constraint there will be one less than all possible number of dummies)", "The predictive power of the model will be even better if one uses dummies to replicate the segmentation tree", "These dummies would provide the same differentiation in response rate as that of the five individual segments. Hence, it can be seen that the differentiation in response rate which\u00a0is provided by the segmentation can easily be replicated by using a set of dummy variables in an overall regression model.", "However, this is not the complete explanation behind the low lift in predictive power.\u00a0It is also important to consider\u00a0the set of segmented models or the child models. Fig-2 provides the list of variables in the child models.", "The variables in each model are ordered in accordance to their predictive strength (as measured by the Wald Chi Square and the Standardized Betas). The same color has been used to depict a particular variable across segments so as to make the comparison easier.", "Fig-2: Variables across the 5 child models", "It can be observed that the variables in each of the five child models are quite similar, though the relative ordering of the variables is slightly different. This implies that the drivers of response are similar across segments. In addition, if one considers the predictive pattern of a particular variable across segments, one can observe something even more interesting.", "Fig-3 depicts the predictive pattern for the variable \u201cNumber of purchase in the last 12 months\u201d.\u00a0For depicting the predictive pattern, the Weight of Evidence (WoE) has been plotted. ", "Weight of Evidence is a common measure used for understanding if a particular range of value for a variable has a relatively higher or lower concentration of the desired target. A positive value of WoE indicates that there is a higher concentration of the target and vice-versa. ", "In this case, for higher values of number of purchases, one observes a higher WoE; indicating a relatively higher concentration of the\u00a0respondents. While\u00a0building a linear model, the average value of the target across\u00a0each range of the variable should be used for understanding the predictive pattern.", "A visual inspection of the graph reveals that though the individual WoEs are different across the segments, yet the trend is very similar. This implies that the predictive pattern of the variable is same across segments. Therefore, the impact of variable in overall model is not very different as compared to the segment wise impact.", "In other words, it means that there is no interaction effect between the segmenting variables (i.e. age and income) aJnd the predictor variable \u201c\u201cNumber of purchase in the last 12 months\u201d. Hence, the segmentation is not expected to yield any benefit with regards to lift in predictive power.", "It should also be noted that in this case the information value of the variables are also similar across segments. In case of a linear model, partial R square can be used instead of information value. If this is the case for most of highly predictive variables, then segmentation would add limited value to the overall predictive power.", "Fig-3: Predictive Pattern of the Variable \u201cNumber of purchase in the last 12 months\u201d Across the Five Segments", "In order to harness the interaction effect between the segmenting variables and the predictor variables, it is important to devise a segmentation scheme where predictors and\u00a0predictive patterns of the variables are different across segments.", "This will help one to create a scenario where the predictive power of the segmented models is higher than the predictive power of the overall model. Fig-4 provides an alternate segmentation scheme for the problem described earlier.", "Fig-4: Sample segmentation for building a logistic regression \u2013 alternate methodology", "In this case, one would develop the following segmented models (child models):", "The variables in the child models have been depicted in Fig-5. As in earlier case, the common variables have been highlighted in same color. It can be observed that in this case, the extent of overlap of the variables between segments is very limited. Therefore, each segment represents a homogeneous set of customers for whom the driver of response are almost completely different.", "Hence, in this case the Gini of the segmented system of models is significantly higher compared to the Gini of the overall model. This segmentation provides a significantly superior predictive power which is created due to the interaction of the segmenting variables and the predictor variables.", "Fig-5: Variables across the 4 child models", "Fig-6: Predictive Pattern of the Variable \u201cNumber of purchase in the last 24 months\u201d Across the Five Segments", "In this case, one can observe that the predictive pattern of a particular variable is significantly different across segments. The lines in Fig-5 are much more dispersed and look different from one another as compared to Fig-3, which indicates that the predictive pattern of the variable is different across segments.", "Therefore the impact of the variable in the overall model is quite very different as compared to the segment wise impact. In other words, it means that there is significant interaction effect between the segmenting variables and the predictor variable \u201cNo. of different categories of purchase made in last 18 months\u201d.", "Hence, the segmentation is expected to produce superior lift in predictive power. It should also be noted that in this case the information value of the variables are also different across segments.", "There is another interesting aspect to it. For\u00a0segmentation, it is also good to consider machine learning algorithms based on multiple trees. Multiple Additive Regression Tree, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Boosting are techniques that use a multitude of trees and an ensemble of the same for making predictions.", "For instance if one considers stochastic gradient boosting, at a very simplistic (and possibly amateurish level), the method involves building an ensemble of trees wherein the residual from the first tree is used as the target for the second tree and so on till no further improvement in predictive power is observed.", "Each tree in this case consists of a few nodes and ensures that it does not over fit the data. In reality, each of these tree is expected to capture the interaction effect instead of fitting too closely to the target at hand. One can relate this philosophy (at a broad level) with the idea behind creation of segments for developing models, wherein the objective of the segmentation is not to achieve a closer fit with the target but to identify interaction effects.", "In fact, a possible way of identifying the segments for developing separate models may involve considering the nodes of the first few trees in a stochastic gradient boosting ensemble of trees and consider if those are appropriate for building segmented models.", "In this article, we learnt the following aspects:", "Did you find the article useful ?
