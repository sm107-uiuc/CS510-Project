Only a small percentage of these applicants get through!", "Qualifying for studying Analytics / Data Science as a post graduate course in US is not easy. But it\u2019s not impossible either. I recently got selected in\u00a02016-2018 batch for\u00a0MS in Data Science at Columbia University.\u00a0So, I thought I will share my learnings and research with our community.", "Before starting the research, you should be asking this. If you follow this field closely, the answer should be obvious.\u00a0US is the largest analytics / data science market in the entire world. The major benefit of pursuing Masters in US is to gain access to the large pool of upcoming job opportunities in US. It is also one of the most mature market in analytics / data science evolution.", "If you\u2019ve ever dreamed of working as a data scientist in US, this guide with take you a step closer.\u00a0In this article, I\u2019ve provided a detailed analysis of 10 good\u00a0MS Programs in Analytics /Data Science in US. I\u2019ve seen that people become clueless in\u00a0choosing the best college / university for themselves. Therefore, I\u2019ve also provided a detailed explanation of selection parameters which can be used to evaluate goodness of any university program.", "Note:\u00a0This is not an exhaustive list. I\u2019ve only listed the best universities which one should consider which applying for analytics programs in US.", "Before jumping into the programs, I would like to discuss some\u00a0aspects which you should consider while judging a program. There is no absolute ranking among programs because each program is stronger / better than others\u00a0in some aspects. So, choosing a university completely\u00a0depends on your preference and choice\u00a0of parameters as described below:", "Having understood the key parameters\u00a0we should keep\u00a0in mind while evaluating a masters program, lets consider some of the good\u00a0 programs that I came across while\u00a0applying for my masters.", "For a better view,\u00a0I\u2019ve provided ranking to these universities on 4 parameters namely Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Business\u00a0based on US News.", "Therefore, for you to decide which is better, you would have to weight these parameters accordingly. For example, if you think that you are good at mathematics but not computer science, choose the\u00a0programs with a higher concentration on mathematics in the curriculum.", "Columbia University is located in the heart of New York city. Being an Ivy League institution, there are no questions about its reputation. The MS program\u00a0is being run by the Data Science Institute at Columbia. The students have access to courses from all the top programs at the institute. The general course duration is 16 months,i.e. 3 semesters of study and an internship semester.", "Conclusion:\u00a0The program provides a good foundation in\u00a0machine learning and programming along with practical experience. Moreover Columbia\u00a0is ranked in top 20 in all the domains related to data science making it\u00a0a good choice. One drawback of the program could be that the curriculum is a bit inclined towards programming and more technical in nature than few other programs, which are more business oriented.", "NYU\u00a0is located in New York city and is fairly\u00a0reputed. The MS program\u00a0is being run by the Center for Data Science at NYU. The students have access to courses from a wide range of departments including statistics, AI, bio-statistics, business, economics, psychology etc. The\u00a0course can be completed in 3 or 4 semesters, depending on the choice of students.", "Conclusion: This program will provided a strong foundation in\u00a0machine learning and ample experience in a particular domain through the 6 electives courses. NYU might lack slightly in terms of the departmental rankings but the program structure and location of NYC\u00a0will definitely", "Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is one of the topmost universities for research in computer science. It\u2019s CS department also run few\u00a0specialized masters programs.", "These programs focus on one core domain, have higher tuition fee and offers no assistance. They treat them as cash cow programs but\u00a0students benefit from the high quality pedagogy. MSCDS is one such\u00a0program. It spans over 16 months with 3 semesters of study and an internship semester.", "Conclusion:\u00a0This is a CS oriented program and ideal\u00a0for people with some coding experience who want to get into machine learning. The drawback being that the business side of the program is weak and you should not expect getting some domain experience like finance/healthcare. It\u00a0is better suited for software engineering roles rather than data scientist roles.", "This is another program like #3 offered by the Machine Learning Department in the dept of CS at CMU. The core idea is the same except for a couple of changes:", "This would also prepare you for software engineering or research roles. You should choose this if you\u00a0have a theoretical bent of mind and would like to pursue a doctorate (Ph.D) after masters.", "This interdisciplinary masters program is being run by McCormick (engineering), Kellogg (management) and Medill (journalism) schools at NWU along with industry professionals in the Chicago area. It\u2019s a 15 month program with a 10 week internship.", "Conclusion:\u00a0This program is designed for people working in a particular domain who want to understand analytics and its applications in different industries. It is not designed for techies who want to incorporate\u00a0machine learning algorithms in their software. The program makes heavy use of the industry connections coming from Kellogg School of Management, which is one of the most reputed management institution of the world.", "This interdisciplinary program is run jointly by the College\u00a0of Engineering, Business and Computing at GaTech. Its a 1 year program and covers the fall, spring and summer semesters.", "Conclusion:\u00a0This is a typical coursework based program. One drawback could be\u00a0the choice between a capstone and internship. Also, the short duration of the program will put additional academic burden and restricts the\u00a0networking opportunities. The positives are in terms of GaTech\u2019s brand name and the involvement of operations research courses in which GaTech is one of the best institutes.", "This program is managed by the Institute of Advanced Analytics at NCSU and is the first analytics program started way back in 2007.", "Most of the other programs are 2-4 years old and thus lack recognition. But NCSU is a highly reputed program in the analytics industry, even though NCSU as a whole is considered a tier 2 institution. This is a 10-month intensive program, with 3 semesters starting in the summer and ending in spring. Moreover, GRE score is not required for application, only TOEFL is required.", "Conclusion:\u00a0NCSU is a well reputed program with good future prospects. It prepare candidates well for data scientist roles as it exposes them to a wide spectrum of analytics techniques. Strong mathematics and statistics fundamentals are required to get into this program and you should apply only if you are confident about\u00a0the same.", "The masters program at TAMU is offered by the department of statistics and it\u2019s a part-time program for working professionals. The program website is not much informative but TAMU as an institution has a decent reputation in the industry. Being a part time program, it is spread over 5 semesters.", "Overall, it is a decent program and\u00a0designed specifically for working professionals.", "This is a 1 year program which commences\u00a0in the spring semester and continues in summer and fall with graduation in December. The course prepares students for data scientist roles in industries such as\u00a0consulting, automotive, consumer products, retail, and financial services.", "Conclusion:\u00a0This is a good\u00a0program and if you like the fixed curriculum, it might work out. Also, since Michigan State University is not as reputed as some other universities mentioned here, it might be easier to get in.", "This is another 1 year program commencing\u00a0in fall, with a more or less fixed curriculum. It prepares the candidates for business analyst and data scientist positions.", "Conclusion: This is a slightly less reputed university with a decent program which should be comparatively easier to get through. But you should be comfortable with the curriculum before you think about taking it up.", "I\u2019m adding a list of other programs which you can consider and evaluate using the ideas shared above. Please feel free to drop a comment if you feel other programs should be added and I\u2019ll be happy to make a mention here.", "MS in other departments\u00a0with Data Science/Machine Learning specialization:", "List of online data science programs \u2013 click here.", "List of online\u00a0business analytics programs \u2013 click here.", "In this article, I\u2019ve\u00a0discussed the various factors which you should consider while selecting a masters program in data science in USA. I have also evaluated\u00a010 programs on some of these factors\u00a0based on available information.", "This should be sufficient for making an initial selection of which courses to apply to. But while making the final selection of which institution to attend, you should consider additional factors which might require your extra\u00a0effort and research.", "Please note that these days there are many traditional courses which offer a specialization in data science like an MS in Computer Science with machine learning track or an MS in Statistics with data science track. I haven\u2019t\u00a0considered such courses here because they have a focus on the core subject with subtle emphasis on data science. If you have a core domain, you can check out such courses as well.", "I would like to restate that this is by no means a ranking of the institutions. Actually, rankings will be very relative because each program has some pros and cons making the suitability vary from one individual to other. However, I have provided rankings from a trusted source for different subjects here which can be used as a metric to judge the university in area of your interest.", "Hope this helps you in making a good career choice. If you have any questions, please feel free to discuss in comments.", "Aarshay graduated from MS in Data Science at Columbia University in 2017 and is currently an ML Engineer at Spotify New York. He works at an intersection or applied research and engineering while designing ML solutions to move product metrics in the required direction.
