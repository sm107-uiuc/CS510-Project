The flooding has been attributed to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon.", "In the city of Chennai, the impact of the heavy rainfall was compounded by the overfull water reservoirs, which soon started to spill over into the city. Whole neighborhoods were inundated, with loss of power, communication and access to essentials. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Indian Army and disaster management units were pressed into service. Rescue and rehabilitation efforts spanned well over 2 weeks.", "What emerged conspicuously during this unprecedented crisis was the coordination of relief efforts over social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Volunteers, NGOs and other rescue parties were observed to be sending out alerts, requests and sharing useful information related to the flooding on social media. Others used social media to check up on their loved ones, share information, express opinions and sending out requests for help.", "A tweet is a social media message posted on Twitter.com.

Examples are \u2018is\u2019, \u2018but\u2019, \u2018shall\u2019, \u2018by\u2019 etc. These words were removed by matching the corpus with the stopwords list in the tm package of R. Expletives were also removed.", "Removing non-English words: The corpus generated after performing the last 3 steps were broken into their constituent words and all English words and words less than 4 characters long were removed.
