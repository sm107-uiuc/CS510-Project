We believe knowledge can only be useful when it is applied and\u00a0tested time and again. The motive behind AV hackathons is to challenge your self and realize\u00a0your true\u00a0potential.", "Our recent hackathon, \u201cThe Smart Recruits\u201d was a phenomenal success and we are deeply thankful to our community for their\u00a0participation. More than 2500 data aspirants made close to 10,000 submissions over a weekend to take the coveted spot.", "It was a 48 hour data science challenge and we challenged our community with a real life machine learning challenge. The competition was fierce and top data scientists competed against each other.", "As you would know, the best part of our community is that people share their knowledge / approach with fellow community members. Read on to find the secret recipe from the winners, which would help you to improve yourself further.", "The competition launched on midnight of 23rd July with more than 2500\u00a0registration and 48 hours to go and as expected in no time our slack channel was buzzing with discussion. The individuals were pleasantly surprised with the data set and participants were convinced that it\u2019s not a cake walk. Overnight, the heat rose and hackathon platform was bustling with ideas and execution strategies.", "The participants were required to help Fintro \u2013 \u00a0a financial distribution company \u00a0to\u00a0help assessing potential agents which will be profitable for the company. The evaluation metric used was AUC- ROC.", "Fintro is an offline financial distribution company operating across India from past 10 years. They sell financial products to consumers with the help of agents. The managers at Fintro identify the right talents and recruit these agents. Once the candidate has been hired by the company they undergo a training for next 7 days and have to clear an assessment to become an agent with Fintro. \u00a0The agents work as freelancers and get paid in commission for each product they sell.", "However, Fintro is facing a challenge of not being able to generate enough business from its agents.", "Fintro invests invaluable time and money in recruiting & training the agents.

Kanishk discovered that the target variable when grouped by application date gave a constant percentage! We incorporated this feature in our model and our score shot up.

And this proved to be a great decision.", "While plotting the target variable for a sample set of days, I found a glaring pattern. Within a day, a large proportion of positive samples appeared in the first half, and vice-versa. At first, it seemed too good to be true. I quickly created a feature based on ordering and saw a big jump in CV score, crossing the 0.8 mark. On exploring this pattern in detail, I was unsure whether it is leakage or whether it is just a pattern that applications received initially in the day are more likely to be accepted than ones later.
