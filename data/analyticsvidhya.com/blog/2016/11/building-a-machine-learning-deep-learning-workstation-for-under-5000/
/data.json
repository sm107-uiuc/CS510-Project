There are so many choices out there. Would you go for NVidia developer box and spend $15,000? or could you build something better in a more cost-effective manner. Which hardware is right for your requirements? How much RAM do you need? The questions are endless and there might be no right or wrong answers.", "We just finished building our first workstation at Analytics Vidhya. It was a special moment for all of us at Analytics Vidhya. Not because the server is a monster (which it is) and we can now let our fantasies run on a much larger machine. But, because we were all proud of what we have built together. Building this server was symbolic of something much bigger. It meant that as an organization, we are coming out of our monthly cash flow challenges and starting to build for an exciting future.", "While building this work station, we faced several trade-offs. We made several choices people come across while creating a workstation for data science. In this article, I will highlight some of the choices we made while building this server, the steps in getting it up and running and the thrill of running first large dataset on it. If you are only interested in knowing the configuration, you can read it below. If you are interested in understanding the trade-offs and the reasons for the hardware / software we chose, you can continue to read the rest of the article.", "I am sure some of you would be asking, why build a monster workstation in today\u2019s world? Why not rent a machine on the cloud?", "The true answer is it depends on your requirements. In our case, this was the best way to enable the team to do machine learning at scale. Just to give some context, Analytics Vidhya currently has 5 people today, who might work on large datasets or huge computations. These datasets could come from competitions, real world problems from clients looking to crowd source solutions from our community or running solutions of our winners to verify them.", "Here are the reasons, why building a workstation worked best for us:", "Obviously nothing comes free in life. So, while we had these advantages, there were a few down sides as well. Here are the compromises we had to make:", "Given the pros were working out better for us and I think we would still be able to use the server a few years down the line, we went ahead with the decision to build a workstation.", "Once we decided that we would build a workstation, there were a few more decisions we had to take. Here were the decisions we needed to take:", "Once these high level decisions were taken, we started the search on finding hardware components of the server.", "Given the spread of Hardware, length of GPU and the cost constraints \u2013 we decided to go with Storm Trooper Cabinet.", "With all the hardware ready, it was time to assemble the server. If you have not done this before, it might look a bit intimidating from outside, but it is not. The components are meant to fit in only in the slots they are supposed to fit in. So, here was the monster ready to breathe", "With the hardware ready, we were excited to the core. The next thing was installing the right software. Before doing so, make sure your server is connected via a LAN cable and is attached to power. It is advisable to add a wireless keyboard so that you can start installation of desired software. Once you are ready, it is time to awaken the monster \u2013 BOOM!", "Time to feed the machine with the right software:", "You can add other packages you may need depending on your need, but this should give you a base setup ready. Time to add Deep Learning tools.", "Deep learning is an active field of research. With a wide\u00a0variety of available libraries to choose from and their individual dependencies, it is very hard to maintain a continuously working DL system. Hence, it is usually a good practice to set up your own virtual environment. This is what we did.", "The easiest solution was\u00a0to use containers, which are essentially \u201cboxes\u201d of self-contained softwares. Its like virtualization of OS, but along with the ease of access from local machine.", "The first step we did was to setup nvidia drivers", "Integrating GPU on docker has some additional steps:", "Now comes the main part, installing DL libraries on docker. We built the docker from scratch, following this excellent guide (https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker/blob/master/README.md)", "Thats it! We have completed the \u201cinstallation steps\u201d. There were a few more things to, i.e. handle data persistency. DL requires huge amount of data to be processed and the best way\u00a0to share this data to docker system is add as a data volume (https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).", "And Voila! We have a complete running Deep Learning system!", "We shared our\u00a0decisions and choice of hardware / software as there are so many options available today. It is difficult to find the right option for you among all the options. If you are looking to build your own workstation, this guide should be immensely helpful to you. If you are not looking to build one, there is still a lot to learn from the process. I myself learnt a lot of finer aspects about hardware selection while going through this journey.", "If you had to build one workstation under $4,500 \u2013 how would you go about doing so? Would you do something different? If so, why? Looking forward to hear from you.", "Kunal is a post graduate from IIT Bombay in Aerospace Engineering. He has spent more than 10 years in field of Data Science. His work experience ranges from mature markets like UK to a developing market like India.
