I think both the libraries are fascinating with their pros one over the other. I decided to make this more interesting and do a comparison between two superpowers of Deep Learning.", "In this article, I\u2019ve covered a basic overview of Keras and Theano. Then I will be explaining in details with the help of use cases why & when should one prefer Theano over Keras. Then I\u2019ve explained about advanced techniques like transfer learning and fine tuning, with a case study combining all the mentioned topics.", "Before we proceed further, let\u2019s look at the definitions of Theano and Keras.", "A programming language which runs on top of Python but has its own data structure\u00a0which are tightly integrated with numpy, allowing faster implementation of mathematical expressions", "Keras is a high level library, used specially for building neural network models. Keras was specifically developed for fast execution of ideas.\u00a0It is written in (and for) Python", "Theano and Keras are built keeping specific things in mind and they excel in the fields they were built for. Theano is more of a matrix manipulation library with an optimized compiler on its backend. Whereas Keras is a deep learning library built over Theano to abstract most of the code to give an easier interface.", "Keras is a very useful deep learning library but it has its own pros and cons, which has been explained in my previos article on\u00a0Keras. The main scenario in which you would prefer Theano is when you want to build a custom neural network model.", "Theano is flexible enough when it comes to building your own models. You can write you own functions and optimizations and easily integrate it with your model. This is especially useful in research environment, when it comes to innovating new ideas.", "A recently published paper called \u201cBinarized Neural Networks: Training Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or \u22121\u201d \u00a0uses an innovative strategy. As the name says, they change the typical values of weights & activations and replace them with binary values.", "To build this \u201cBinary Net\u201d, you would have to rewrite the code for value representations in a neural network. So using low-level libraries like Theano,\u00a0can easily make this possible.", "Now, I will be taking you through an implementation of a neural network written in Theano.", "A typical implementation of Neural Network would be as follows:", "Here we solve our deep learning practice problem \u2013\u00a0Identify the Digits.\u00a0 Let\u2019s for a moment take a look at our problem statement.", "Our problem is an image recognition, to identify digits from a given 28 x 28 image. We have a subset of images for training and the rest for testing our model. So first, download the train and test files. The dataset contains a zipped file of all the images in the dataset and both the train.csv and test.csv have the name of the\u00a0corresponding train and test images. Any additional features are not provided in the datasets, just the raw images are provided in \u2018.png\u2019 format.", "Now let\u2019s first get to know how to build a neural network model in Theano.", "The above image is represented as numpy array, as seen below:", "And we\u2019re done! We just created our own trained neural network!", "As we have seen before, training a neural network from scratch is a pain. It can require extensive training times as the number of parameters increase. But now with techniques like transfer learning, you can essentially cut short a lot of this training time.", "But what is Transfer Learning? The technique can be interpreted by observing a teacher-student scenario. A teacher has years of experience in the particular topic he/she teaches. With all this accumulated information, the lectures that students get is a concise and brief overview of the topic. So it can be seen as a \u201ctransfer\u201d of information from the learned to a novice.", "Keeping in mind this analogy, we compare this to neural network. A neural network is trained on a data. This network gains knowledge from this data, which is compiled as \u201cweights\u201d of the network. These weights can be extracted and then transferred to any other neural network. Instead of training the other neural network from scratch, we \u201ctransfer\u201d the learned features.", "This transfer of learned features can be done across any domains. To make the models domain specific, you have to train it on the original domain. This is where fine tuning comes in. Fine tuning is retraining your model on the intended data but with decreased \u201clearning rates\u201d. You essentially try to change only those things which could increase your model\u2019s overall effectiveness. Fine tuning can be considered the same as tuning strings of a guitar.", "Let us try understanding the topics with an example:", "Suppose you have images of dogs and you want to your model to recognize whether there\u2019s a dog in the picture? How would you solve this problem?", "We take a neural network mode, say VGG-16 (as displayed below) and train it on ImageNet data. For those who don\u2019t know what ImageNet is, it\u2019s a dataset comprised of tens of thousands of images with their respective labels. Training on such a big dataset is no small feat. It takes a lot of time and resources to train on such a data.", "So what you would do is, download a pre-trained VGG model (which have been trained by other people) and use the weights of this model to initialize your own model. Then you retrain the model on your required problem. During retraining you can essentially \u201cfreeze\u201d the first few layers, i.e. you can set the learning rates of these layers to 0, and continue training. You do this because you are fine-tuning your model, i.e. you adjust the parameters of a pre-trained network to better fit your data.", "Now let\u2019s jump on to a practical use case! We will be using the practice problem again, but this time we\u2019ll be combining everything we\u2019ve learnt uptil now and implement it. A short overview of what will do, we\u2019ll first train a custom neural network built with Theano, extract pre-trained weights from this network and fine-tune a Keras model. Let\u2019s go!", "NOTE: Some steps we\u2019ll see now have been explained in above code. We\u2019re changing some parts of it to see a case study of transfer learning and fine tuning", "Techniques like Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning are a great way to increase the efficiency of neural networks both in terms of time and memory resources. As you saw in the case study, it\u2019s pretty easy to implement ideas when you have an understanding of it. Tools like Theano and Keras give us the ability to go beyond what is already done, to innovate and build something useful. In reality, it is you who gets superpowers when you use them!", "There are many things still unexplored in Deep Learning / Neural Networks, each and every day, there are papers being published and projects being done to push the boundaries. Therefore knowing the tools and how to leverage them is an absolute must to everyone who wants to make a dent in this field.", "I hope you found this article helpful. Now, it\u2019s time for you to practice and read as much as you can.Good Luck!", "What\u2019s your Keras vs Theano story, and which superpower do you prefer? Tell me about it in the comments below and let\u2019s discuss further. \u00a0And to gain expertise in working in neural network don\u2019t forget to try out our deep learning practice problem \u2013\u00a0Identify the Digits.", "Faizan is a Data Science enthusiast and a Deep learning rookie.
