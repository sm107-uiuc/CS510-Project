However, R-squared has additional problems that the adjusted R-squared and predicted R-squared are designed to address.\nEvery time you add a predictor to a model, the R-squared increases or remains same.", "The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.", "For more detail, you can refer this discussion.", "Q37. If we were evaluating the model performance with the help below visualizations which we have plotted for three different models for same regression problem on same training data. What do you conclude after seeing this visualization?", "1. The training error in first plot is maximum as compare to second and third plot.\n2. The best model for this regression problem is the last (third) plot because it has minimum training error (zero).\n3. The second model is more robust than first and third because it will perform best on unseen data.\n4. The third model is overfitting more as compare to first and second.\n5. All will perform same because we have not seen the testing data.", "Solution: C\nThe trend in the graphs looks like a quadratic trend over independent variable X. A higher degree(Right graph) polynomial might have a very high accuracy on the train population but is expected to fail badly on test dataset. But if you see in left graph we will have training error maximum because it underfits the training data.", "Q38. What are the assumptions we need to follow while applying linear regression?", "1. It is important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.\n2. The linear regression analysis requires all variables must have normal distribution\n3. Linear regression assumes that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.", "Q39. When we build linear models, we look at the correlation between variables. While searching for the correlation coefficient in the correlation matrices, if we found that correlation between 3 pairs of variables (Var1 and Var2 , Var2 and Var3 , Var3 and Var1) is -0.98, 0.45 and 1.23 respectively. What can we infer from this?", "1. Correlation between Var1 and Var2, it shows a high correlation\n2. Since correlation between Var1 and Var2 is very high we can consider it a case of multicollinearity so we can remove either of Var1 and Var2 from our model\n3. The correlation coefficient of 1.23 between Var3 and Var1 is not possible.", "Q40. If there is a high non-linearity & complex relationship between dependent & independent variables, a tree model is likely to outperform a classical regression method.
