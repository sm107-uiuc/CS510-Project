The road to becoming a data scientists is tedious.\u00a0It requires sheer perseverance and a lot of hard work. Bishwarup\u2019s journey not only tells us how to\u00a0make a career in data science, but also how to become one of the best.", "Bishwarup completed his Bachelors in Statistics from University of Calcutta. His experience varies from being a data analyst to being an independent analytics consultant and finally joining a startup as a data scientist. He has won several competitions on Analytics Vidhya and is currently ranked 8th on our datahack platform.", "He is a huge inspiration for all of us and one of the best minds I have come across in analytics industry. We wanted to know more about his journey and what kept him going. So, we conducted an exclusive interview with him.", "Here are the excepts from my conversations with him!", "KJ: First of all, I would like to sincerely thank you for devoting time for this interview. Kindly tell us about yourself and how did you start your career in analytics?", "Bishwarup: I am glad to have this opportunity to present myself to such a fascinating group of professional and aspiring data scientists and I really thank you and the team AnalyticsVidhya at large for that. I hail from a Statistical background. I always liked the part where Statistical methods are used to solve real-life problems like driving the growth of a business or facilitating various workflows in a large organization and many more. On the other hand, I\u2019ve always had a knack for learning different programming languages and I am still learning. I think that helped me a lot to get me going and make my journey very interesting as a data scientist. I started as a Data Analyst in a product based start-up. However, not after long I started providing independent consulting services.", "KJ: When and why did you think that you will start your own consultancy?", "Bishwarup: While working as an independent consultant, I made quite a few contacts with offshore clients who wanted to work with me in a confidential manner and without the hassle of going through different freelancing web portals. In the beginning, I would take care of most of their requirements by myself, but going ahead I got involved with a number of long term projects where time management became an issue. I was almost working 16 hours a day at a point. So, I thought of reaching out to a few like-minded people I knew who could potentially help me in this regard. All of us together, thought that it would be better for us to work as a team rather than a number of people working on their own. So, I went ahead and registered a business. The business was good in its initial years. But today almost every analytics service is being automated and we too took a pretty bad hit. So very recently, I thought of moving out of what I was doing and at this moment, I am working with Decision Minds Pvt Ltd, a US based start-up, in the role of a Senior Data Scientist.", "KJ: Tell us 3 things life has taught you in your journey from a data analyst to founder of a company and going back to corporate again?", "KJ: Tell us a bit more on what challenges did you face in your journey? How did you overcome them?", "Bishwarup: The most critical challenge, I think you would agree, to make up your mind when thinking something out of the box. Apart from that, I had a financial constraint at a point which got better with time. Also, I would like to mention that when I started my own consultancy services.", "KJ: You are currently ranked 74th on Kaggle among more than 50,000 people. Amazing feat. Please describe your journey.", "Bishwarup: I joined Kaggle almost a couple of years back. At that time, I was exploring potential ways of enhancing my skills in data science, not just by enrolling into some online course but something that will provide me with hands-on experience of what it takes to deal with large scale data. I found Kaggle very useful and I am really glad that I kept myself involved in there. My first competition in Kaggle was Springleaf Marketing and the data was quite large to fit into 4GB RAM laptop that I had at that point. I was confused by the advanced discussions going on the forums and I had little idea how to efficiently approach the problem. However, I went ahead and rented a AWS instance to implement whatever I could learn and we finally ended up at the 27th position in the private leaderboard among 2226 teams. I was pretty satisfied with my effort and since then I\u2019ve always believed I can do better in every competition in which I take part and that\u2019s what helped me to learn a lot of new things including stuff like how to preprocess large data files in a number of different ways, stacked generalization and many more. From my personal experience, I have seen people who think of platforms like Kaggle, AnalyticsVidhya, KDD etc. as just a fun competition organizers. However, if you ask me, I would rate these platforms even higher than attending a course in Coursera or Udacity. These platforms promote self-learning which, in my opinion, is the best way to master a subject.", "KJ: Recently, you\u2019ve won various other data science competitions including AV Hackthons, CrowdAnalytix etc. I must say you\u2019ve got the midas touch. Is there any structure / formula / framework you follow to build this winning streak?", "KJ: How do you decide in which Kaggle competition should you participate?", "Bishwarup: Given the time, I would like to participate in all of the competitions as each of them helps one learn something new. However, there is a resource and time constraint on my side, so before entering a contest I like to think of the amount of time I would probably be able to invest behind it. There is no point taking part in a competition, copy some forum scripts and make a number of submissions.", "There are also a lot of competitions related to computer vision that are held in Kaggle, but I don\u2019t have much idea about that subject. I would really like to learn that in near future and participate in such competitions.", "KJ: Which mode do you prefer in a competition? Team or Self?", "Bishwarup: I personally prefer competing solo mainly because of the reason that after the end of the competition you get to know what possibly you could have done differently to make your model better. But participating in team is also advantageous for a number of reasons. For one, you get to learn different ideas and concepts from your teammates. At the same time, it offers a really good scope of ensembling different approaches and surging the leaderboard.", "KJ: According to you, what should be the ideal approach by people to solve problems in these competitions?", "Bishwarup: I don\u2019t think that there is a one size fits all solution here as the problems are quite varied and they come in their own flavours. However, certain things are common across them. For example,", "KJ: Which techniques / algorithms do you think are the most important to learn to give a tough fight in these competitions? Why?", "KJ: According to you, how different are these competitions to real life challenges which are solved in industry using data science and machine learning?", "Bishwarup:\u00a0There is a fundamental difference indeed. In industry, businesses are looking for estimates which are backed by a certain confidence bands \u2013 the confidence interval is more crucial than just a point estimate whereas in online competitions we are crazy about optimizing the evaluation metric even up to the 5th or 6th decimal places. In real life use cases, people are more interested in a directional view of where the business is heading to and find the potential drivers of the change whereas in online contests we rarely bother about what insight we can gather from the data. Besides, the complicated stacked models that we develop to crack the online contests are hardly possible to implement in production environment due to their complexity/long training time/ stochastic nature of optimization. However, it does not mean that such contests offer no career value for people working in companies \u2013 I think most of the companies in their analytics wing, use algorithms like Random Forest or even xGboost. One just have to factor in the domain perspective rather than just applying the black-box machine learning to solve a problem in industry.", "KJ: \u00a0As per your experience, which tutorials, online courses, MOOCs are must to undergo for aspiring data scientists? Which one helped you the most personally?", "Bishwarup: I haven\u2019t taken any online courses, MOOCs or followed any online or offline contents. I learnt by debugging \u2013 whenever stuck with something I would go to stackoverflow or google forums to search for answers. I think it\u2019s the best way to learn. Of course, the courses in websites like Coursera, Udacity or Udemy provide a lot of value \u2013 they will give you a jump start \u2013 but if you want to master a subject, better do it by practicing and being on your own. You will get hundreds of contents describing what deep learning is and where it is used, but not a single content in the web completely describing how to install [theano + gpu + cuda + cudnn] on a Windows machine. In my opinion, there is no use of going through an article if you can\u2019t practice the same side by side.", "KJ: If you had a chance to go back in time, what are the things you would have done differently?", "Bishwarup: I would learn Java to its core and also try to create some kind of routine in my life.", "KJ: What things a fresher must do to get his/her first break in analytics?", "Bishwarup: I would be honest, it\u2019s a very competitive market down there. Going back 7-8 years from now, companies would hire people who can efficiently run a logistic regression but today the outlook is completely different. Corporate establishments are looking for people extremely well equipped with latest technologies \u2013 however, it is not to demotivate the folks who just came out of college or looking to move to data science domain \u2013 I would say:", "Also you should follow the AnalyticsVidhya blog posts which are full of helpful materials. Last time I remember, I read a blog post on D3.js and it was pretty well written.", "I would like to thank the AnalyticsVidhya team once more for providing me with this wonderful opportunity and I look forward to having a long-term relationship with you guys. Your blog posts are fantastic and you guys are doing a great job for the data science community at large. My best wishes for you.", "KJ:\u00a0Thank you Bishwarup for your invaluable time and thoughts. I am sure a lot of people in\u00a0analytics & data science industry will benefit from this. All the best to you too!", "Kunal is a post graduate from IIT Bombay in Aerospace Engineering. He has spent more than 10 years in field of Data Science.
