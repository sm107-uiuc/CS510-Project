It had no target column and no explicit separation between the training and test set. So I discovered, there were more than one potential ways to tackle such problems.", "However, since the evaluation metric for the competition was the area under the ROC curve (AUC), I preferred to first formulate the problem as a case of supervised learning which I think majority of the participants did as well.", "I used the data from 2003-2005 as my training set and matched the customers who repeated in 2006 to derive the labels for my data. That was pretty straightforward. Just formulating the problem in this way and using a very simple xgboost model, I could get > 0.83 on the public leaderboard.", "Then, feature engineering played\u00a0a huge role to play in my success. Since, we were ultimately supposed to predict the probability of a repeat on per user basis, I summarized multiple user records in the training data to one single training instance. The features which helped me are as follows:", "There were more features which I derived, but they did not help my model\u2019s accuracy.", "In the end, I trained two xgboost models on the above features selecting a part of it in each of them and the rank average of them got me to end at 3rd position in this competition with 0.874409 accuracy.", "This was the first time, a team (Team Or) managed to secure a position in Top 3.

He found\u00a0that predictions from tree model and linear model were very different and averaging them was giving a significant boost in CV as well as on LB.", "We kept exploring different styles and finally\u00a0we made 4 tree models and 1 linear model using XGBoost.\u00a0We only made a linear model on the final representation of data on which XGBOOST was giving best CV. We finished at Rank 2 with\u00a00.876660 accuracy.", "In this competition, we learned a lot about sparse matrices. We decided to learn simple things like aggregating, transformation etc. on sparse matrices which is very helpful in exploring large data sets in an efficient way.", "In the end, we would like to tell young aspiring data science folks to never give up. Every time you feel like giving up, try to make a different representation of data and try different models on them.", "Rohan Rao is currently working as a Data Scientist at AdWyze.

More than anything, I\u2019ve learned many new things. I am glad I finally got my maiden win!", "The road to achieve a seer\u2019s accuracy turned out to be interesting. Unlike a majority of predictive modelling competitions, this hackathon did not have the standard train/test data format.", "I started off with understanding how best to build a machine-learning based solution with the data, along with setting up a stable validation framework.", "Based on my CV-LB scores from an XGBoost model, that were quite well in sync, I explored each variable and started working on feature engineering. I could see, that there is subtle but good scope of creating new variables.", "My final model was an ensemble of 3 XGBoost models, each having a different set of data points, features and parameters. The ensemble was mainly to ensure more stability in the predictions.\u00a0I explored few other ML-based models, but none were as good as XGBoost. Even their ensembling with XGBoost did not help. This way I won this competition with\u00a0the\u00a0accuracy of 0.88002.", "I feel, it is always wonderful to work with clean datasets that are designed over a good problem statement. And, this hackathon was very well organized. The CV-LB stable correlation was a huge plus because it enabled me to focus on feature engineering, which is the most exciting part of building machine learning models.", "It was nice to see and compete with many of the top data scientists in India, and at the end, I\u2019m glad I finished 1st to win my maiden competition on AnalyticsVidhya.", "The biggest learning for me from this competition was the importance of drilling down into understanding the problem statement inside out and building a robust and solid solution step-by-step. And, then practice more so that one can do these as quickly as possible. It might sound cliche but it actually works!", "Finally, some of the tips I would like to give to aspiring data scientists:", "Always trust your Cross-Validation (CV) score. And to trust your CV, you need to build the right validation method depending on the problem, data and evaluation. During the competition, explore and try out as many ideas as possible. You\u2019d be surprised to know that sometimes, the simplest algorithm\u00a0or the least obvious ones could also work out. In the end, always be ready to learn from others and never hesitate in asking for help. There\u2019s always something to learn for everyone.", "This competition gave a clean well structured data set. Hence, no efforts were required in data cleaning. But, problem framing (which most of us overlook) paved the way towards success. Moving away from a conventional ML competition, turned out to be challenging event for participants but eventually gave them something new to learn. Below are the key takeaways from our top 3 participants:", "Some of your might have sought motivation & some of you take away knowledge from this article. If you have thoroughly read the winners talk, you would have realized that winning this competition didn\u2019t require anything extra ordinary technique. It wasn\u2019t about knowing advanced machine learning algorithms, but required a simple approach of understanding the problem.", "Therefore, next time when you come for challenge, make sure you\u2019ve understood what has been asked for, and then start working on predictive modeling. This way you\u2019ll have more confidence while working. Last but not the least, learn about cross validation, xgboost and feature engineering.", "Did you find this article helpful ?
