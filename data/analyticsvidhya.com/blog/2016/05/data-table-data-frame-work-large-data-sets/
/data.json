They get haunted by repetitive warnings, error messages of insufficient memory usage. Most of them come to an immediate conclusion, that their machine specification isn\u2019t powerful enough. It\u2019s time to upgrade the RAM or work on a new machine. Have you ever thought this way?", "If you have seriously worked on data sets, I\u2019m sure you would have. Even, I did too when I participated in The Black Friday. The data set contained more than 400,000 rows. I was totally clueless. Honestly, it was frustrating to see RStudio taking hours to execute one line of code. As we say, \u2018necessity is the mother of all inventions\u2019. I was in need of a solution.", "After 2 hours of internet research, I came across an interesting set of R packages and APIs, specially made to work with large data sets without compromising with execution speed. One such package is data.table.", "In this article, I\u2019ve shared a smart approach which you should use when you work on large data sets. As you scroll down, you will come across the type of changes you can make to improve your R coding. It\u2019s time to write codes which are fast and short. Consider it as a quick tutorial on data.table package.", "Note: This article is best suited to beginners in data science using R who mainly work on data sets using\u00a0data.frame() .If you are already a proficient user of data.table, this might not interest you.", "It\u2019s important to understand the factors which deters your R code performance.\u00a0Many a times, the\u00a0incompetency\u00a0of your machine is directly correlated with\u00a0the type of work you do while running R code. \u00a0Below are some practices\u00a0which impedes R\u2019s performance on large data sets:", "The package data.table is written by Matt Dowle in year 2008.", "Think of data.table as an advanced version of data.frame. It inherits from data.frame and works perfectly even when data.frame syntax is applied on data.table. This package is good to use with any other package which accepts data.frame.", "The syntax of data.table is quite similar to SQL. Therefore, if you\u2019ve worked on SQL you would quickly understand it. The general form of syntax is:", "Let\u2019s see how does this command work. After the data table is created, I asked data table to filter the rows whose code is C. Then I asked it to calculate the mean capacity of the rows which have code C for every state separately. It\u2019s not necessary that you always mention all the three parts of the syntax.\u00a0Try doing the following commands at your end :", "Write your answers in the comments! Let\u2019s see how quickly you are getting this concept.", "After I delved deeper into data.table, I found several aspects at which data.table package outperforms data.frame. Therefore, I would recommend every R beginner to use data.table as much as they can. There is a lot to explore. The earlier you start, the better you\u2019ll become. You should use data.table because:", "1. It provides blazing fast speed when it comes to loading data. With the fread function in data.table package, loading large data sets need just\u00a0few seconds. For example: I checked the loading time using a data set which contains\u00a0439,541 rows. Let\u2019s see how fast is fread \u2013", "As you saw, loading data with fread is 16x faster than the base function read.csv. fread() is faster than read.csv() because, read.csv() tries to first read rows into memory as character and then tries to convert them into integer and factor as data types. On the other hand, fread() simply reads everything as character.", "2. It is even faster than the popular dplyr, plyr packages used for data manipulation. data.table provides enough room for tasks such as aggregating, filtering, merging, grouping and other related tasks. For example:", "data.table has processed this task 20x faster than dplyr. It happened because it avoids allocating memory to the intermediate steps such as filtering. Also, dplyr creates\u00a0deep copies\u00a0of the entire data frame where as data.table does a shallow copy of the data frame.\u00a0Shallow copy means that the data is not physically copied in system\u2019s memory. It\u2019s just a copy of column pointers (names). Deep copy copies the entire data to another location in the memory. Hence, with memory efficiency, the speed of computation is enhanced.", "3. Not just reading files, writing the files using data.table is much faster than write.csv(). This packages provides fwrite() function enabled with parallelised fast writing ability. So, next time you get to write 1 million rows, try this function.", "4. In built features such as automatic indexing, rolling joins, overlapping range joins further enhances the user experience while working on large data sets.", "Therefore, you see there is nothing wrong with data.frame, it just lacks the wide range of features and operations that data.table is enabled with.", "The idea of this tutorial is to provide you handy commands which can speed up your modeling process. Actually, there is so much to explore in this packages, chances are you might get puzzled from where to start, which command to stick with and when to use a particular command. Here, I provide answer to some of the most common questions which you come across while doing data exploration / manipulation.", "The data set used below can be download from here: download. The data set contains 1714258 rows of 12 columns. It will be interesting to see, how long does the data.table takes in loading this data. Time for action!", "Note: The data set contains uneven distribution of observations i.e. blank columns and NA values. The reason of taking this data is to check the performance of data.table on large data sets.", "It took only 7 seconds to read this file. Do try at your end.", "In a data table, columns are referred to as variables. Therefore, we don\u2019t need to refer to variables as DT$column name, column name alone works just fine. If you do DT[,c(V2,V3,V4)], it would return a vector of values. Using .() symbol, wraps the variables within list() and returns data table. In fact, every data table or data frame is a compilation of list of equal length and different data types. Isn\u2019t it?", "Subsetting data can be done even faster setting\u00a0keys in data table. Keys are nothing but supercharged rownames. A part of it has been demonstrated below.", "Order function is data table is much faster than base function order(). Reason being, order in data table uses radix order sort which impart additional boost. - sign results in descending order.", "We did not assign the results back to DT. This is because, := operator modifies the input object by reference. It results in shallow copies in R which leads to better performance with less memory usage. The result is return invisibly.", "With this line of code, we\u2019ve updated Aberdeen City to Abr City in column V8.", "Check View(DT).\u00a0We see that the data contains\u00a0blank columns in the data set.\u00a0It can be removed using the code above. In fact, all the three steps can be done in command as well. This is known as chaining of commands.", "Let\u2019s calculate mean of V10 variable on the bases of V4 (showing country).", ".N is a special variable in data.table used to calculate the count of values in a variable. If you wish to obtain the order of the variable specified with by option, you can replace by with keyby. keyby automatically orders \u00a0the grouping variable in ascending order.", "keys in data table delivers incredibly fast results. We usually set keys on column names which can be of any type i.e. numeric, factor, integer, character. Once a key is set of a variable, it reorders the column observations in increasing order. Setting a key is helpful, specially when you know that you need to make multiple computations on one variable.", "Once, the key is set, we can subset any value from the key. For example:", "Once the key is set, we no longer need to provide the column name again and again. If we were to look for multiple values in a column, we can write it as:", "Similarly, we can set multiple keys as well. This can be done using:", "We can again, subset value from these two columns simultaneously using:", "There are several other modifications which can be done in the 5 steps demonstrated above. These 5 steps illustrated above will help you to perform the basic data manipulation tasks using data.table. To learn more, I would suggest you to start using this package in your every day R work. You\u2019d face various hurdles and that\u2019s where your learning curve would accelerate. You can also check the official data.table guide here.", "This article is written to provide you a path using which you can easily deal with large data sets. No longer, you need to spend money on upgrading your machines, instead it\u2019s time to upgrade your knowledge of dealing with such situations. Apart from data.table, there are several other packages for parallel computing available. But, I don\u2019t see any need to any other package for data manipulation, once you become proficient with data.table.", "In this article, I discussed about some important aspects which every beginner in R must know while working on large data sets. After data manipulation, the very next hurdle which comes is model building. With large data sets, packages like caret, random forest, xgboost takes a lot of time in computation.
