After all, it helps in building predictive models free from correlated variables, biases and unwanted noise.", "A lot of novice analysts assume that keeping all (or more) variables will result in the best model as you are not losing any information. Sadly, that is not true!", "How many times has it happened that removing a variable from the model has increased your model accuracy ?", "At least, it has happened to\u00a0me. Such variables are often found to be correlated and hinder achieving higher model accuracy. Today,\u00a0we\u2019ll learn one of the ways of how to get rid of such variables in R. I must say, R has an incredible CRAN repository. Out of all packages, one such available\u00a0package for variable selection is Boruta Package.", "In this article,\u00a0we\u2019ll focus on understanding the theory and practical aspects of using Boruta Package. I\u2019ve followed a step wise approach to help you understand better.", "I\u2019ve also drawn a comparison of boruta with other traditional feature selection algorithms. Using this, you can arrive at a more meaningful set of features which can pave the way for a robust prediction model. The terms\u00a0\u201cfeatures\u201d, \u201cvariables\u201d and \u201cattributes\u201d have been used interchangeably, so don\u2019t get confused!", "Boruta is a feature selection algorithm. Precisely, it works as a wrapper algorithm around Random Forest. This\u00a0package derive its name from a\u00a0demon in Slavic mythology who dwelled in pine forests.", "We know that feature selection is a crucial step in predictive modeling. This technique achieves supreme importance when a\u00a0data set comprised of\u00a0several variables is given for model building.", "Boruta can be your\u00a0algorithm of choice to deal with such data sets. Particularly when one is interested in understanding the mechanisms related to the variable of interest, rather than just building a black box predictive model with good prediction accuracy.", "Below\u00a0is the step wise working of boruta algorithm:", "Boruta follows an all-relevant feature selection method where it captures all features which are in some circumstances relevant to the outcome variable. In contrast, most of the traditional feature selection algorithms follow a minimal optimal method where they rely on a small subset of features which yields a minimal error on a chosen classifier.", "While fitting a random forest model on\u00a0a\u00a0data set, you can recursively get rid of features in each iteration which didn\u2019t perform well in the process. This will eventually lead to a minimal optimal subset of features as the method minimizes the error of random forest model. This happens by selecting an over-pruned version of the input data set, which in turn, throws away some relevant features.", "On the other hand, boruta find all features which are either strongly or weakly relevant to the decision variable. This makes it well suited for biomedical applications where one might be interested to determine which human genes (features) are connected in some way to a particular medical condition (target variable).", "Till here, we have understood the theoretical aspects of\u00a0Boruta Package. But, that isn\u2019t enough. The real challenge starts now. Let\u2019s learn to implement this package in R.", "First things first.

More sophisticated methods & packages of missing value imputation can be found here.", "Let\u2019s convert the categorical variables into factor data type.", "Now is the time to implement and check the performance of boruta package.

In this case, out of 11 attributes, 4 of them are rejected and 5 are confirmed. 2 attributes are designated as tentative. Tentative attributes have importance so close to their best shadow attributes that Boruta is not able to make a decision with the desired confidence in default number of random forest runs.", "Now, we\u2019ll plot the boruta variable importance chart.", "By default, plot function in Boruta adds the attribute values to the x-axis horizontally where all the attribute values are not dispayed due to lack of space.", "Here I\u2019m adding the attributes to the x-axis vertically.", "Blue boxplots correspond to minimal, average and maximum Z score of a shadow attribute.
