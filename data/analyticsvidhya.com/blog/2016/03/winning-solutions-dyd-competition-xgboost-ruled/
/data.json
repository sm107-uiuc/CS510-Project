There comes a moment of challenge in every competition\u00a0when participants feel that nothing seems to work their way\u00a0and its time to give up. That\u2019s when a\u00a0person stands up and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I try one more time,\u00a0but this time in\u00a0a different way?\u201d That\u2019s when champions are born.", "Competitions organized at Data Hack are meant to\u00a0challenge your\u00a0skills & knowledge\u00a0and\u00a0give you a chance\u00a0to learn more and become a better analyst / data scientist.", "On a similar note, we organized Date Your Data\u00a0Competition from\u00a026th Feb\u2019 16 to 28th Feb \u201916.\u00a0This competition enticed more than\u00a0~ 2100 participants around the world. Unlike other dates (romantic ones), this date turned out to be\u00a0dramatic. No signs of love were shown. Only fierce\u00a0attempts to slice and dice the data with\u00a0highest level of granularity.", "The emerged winners (top 3) mainly used R and XGBoost\u00a0to rule the leaderboard.\u00a0Here\u2019s a complete solution (approach & codes) used by winners in this competition. You\u2019ll shortly see how feature engineering turned out to be a game changer in this competition.", "For R users, these solutions are\u00a0highly helpful and can be used as a practice material.", "Note: A special thanks to the winners of this competition for their immense co-operation and time.", "This competition surpassed our previous high of number of submissions. It recorded more than 3100 submissions. Also, we got our first female data scientist winner in this competition.", "This competition involved a supervised machine learning problem. Participants were required to predict the chances of a student\u2019s profile to be of high relevance to employers. In simple words, the participants were required to predict whether a student will be shortlisted or not. The data set used was provided by Internshala, India\u2019s No. 1 platform for internships.", "You can read the complete problem statement here: Link. The data set is available for download here. Please note that the data set is available for your practice purpose and will be accessible until 20th March 2016.", "The winners were judged on the basis of ROC score. ROC curve is a plot between sensitivity and (1-specificity). To know more, visit here. AUC score close to 1 is always desirable.", "After a live feedback session with participants held at slack, it was inferred that this competition was challenging and participants were keen to acknowledge\u00a0what they missed!", "A common factor which played a crucial role in their victory\u00a0is their prolonged reverence for\u00a0feature engineering and data exploration. Boosting (XGBoost, GBM) imparted their models necessary accuracy. Ensemble modeling\u00a0played a cameo in further enhancing their model\u2019s accuracy.", "Since most of the coding has been done in R, this can\u00a0be a great resource to practice for R users.", "Sonny Laskar, currently works as a Manager \u2013 Strategy at Microland Limited. He says:", "Like everyone, I started with taking a close look at data. I call it as \u2018data discovery\u2018 stage. Since there were 4 files, the chances of oversight were high. So, I realized that data has spelling mistakes. Later, I discovered some of the variables like internship profile, internship skills had good number of repetitive observations. It was evident that such observations row will dominate the prediction process.", "This impelled me to do one hot encoding of such variables and added them as\u00a0separate features. Later, I label encoded the binary features (0,1). In fact, majority of my time went in encoding features.", "But, this wasn\u2019t enough. I got a terrible score until here. Then, I created additional features with mean, percentages to supply more information to my model. It worked.", "I used caret package.\u00a0I built 2 XGBoost models with different seed values and nrounds.\u00a0Due to lack of time, I didn\u2019t do much experiment with machine learning. I then simply, ensembled my 2 XGBoost models.", "I think I could have achieved higher score, had I not removed duplicate rows from student experience. I\u2019m sure that lead to loss of information, but it was a race against time too. My final score was 0.700698.", "Prarthana Bhat, currently works as a Data Scientist at Flutura Decision Science and Analytics. She\u2019s the first female participant on Data Hack to secure a rank in Top 3.", "When I looked at the data, I discerned that\u00a0feature engineering will\u00a0turn out to\u00a0be a game changer. Hence, right from the beginning I kept my focus on discovering new features.", "Of course, I started with\u00a0the basic hygienic steps of data cleaning. There was a lot of mix and match possible in this data set. Since the data was large, I used parallel computing in R for faster computation and also not to run out of patience. R has awesome libraries such as doParallel, doSNOW, foreach to do this job!", "I think the features I created were able to add significant information to the model. That\u2019s the key to predictive modeling. One should always attempt to extract as much as information (uncorrelated) from available data.", "For modeling, I used XGBoost algorithm. I decided to test for its optimal potential on this data. Then, I did parameter tuning. I decided to stick with only 3 parameters namely eta, colsample_bytree, subsample. In fact, I\u2019d suggest R users to pay attention to these parameters the most for parameter tuning.", "Not to make it a repetitive process, I wrote some functions to do this job. This was time consuming. But, in the end, turned out to be worthy enough. My final score stood at 0.709808.", "Santanu Dutta, currently works as a Senior Associate in ACME. He is an experienced analytics professional specializing in BFSI and marketing. He\u2019s a self learned data scientist.", "I had always been curious to know more about the science of data and how it can derive benefits in our daily lives.\u00a0Since then I have been training myself to build good and stable predictive models by participating in hackathons.", "In this competition, the biggest challenge was shortage of time as the data set was quite huge\u00a0and dirty. Lots of data cleaning was supposed to be done before processing it to build models.\u00a0An early cursory look on date variables, gave hint that pre-processing is going to be the real game changer.", "I have specialized myself in R. But, in last few\u00a0hackathons,\u00a0I noticed that Python is quickly gearing up\u00a0and is becoming the first love of hackathon winners. So, this time I promised myself to walk an extra mile. I used both R and Python to solve this problem (faster). I used R for data wrangling and Python for model building.", "Python was a real challenge for me. Because, in the last few months I\u2019ve badly struggled in implementing XGBoost on my windows machine. So, I selected the next best alternative i.e. GBM. In addition,\u00a0I had built few variations of Random Forest, Boosting , Matrix Factorization models as well and relied on local CV to select the parameters and model.", "It\u2019s been a great privilege competing with leading data scientists across the globe. Learning while competing steepens the learning curve. My public lb score was 0.63 and ranking 17 and private lb score resulted in 0.72 which got me the\u00a0first position.", "In this competition, participants got the chance to work on real life data. Real life data comes in all shapes and dimensions. Hence, it becomes essential to develop business understanding in order to work better with data sets. In DYD, participants worked deeply with data exploration, data engineering and feature engineering techniques. Below are the key takeaways one can take home from this article:", "If you have thoroughly followed this article, you would have noticed that feature engineering and boosting are\u00a0awfully important in winning competitions. So, the next time you would participate in a competition, make sure you don\u2019t miss out creating new features and render\u00a0some boost. In fact, the process is simple: Clean the data, create new features, build the model, keep the best features, build the model again (boost) and done. If you have still been indecisive about, whether to learn R or Python, you can start with R from scratch.", "In this article, I\u2019ve shared the winning approach of top 3 winners of DYD Competition. These winners took home amazon vouchers worth INR 55k ( $800 ). For your practice, the data set is available for download until 20th March 2016.
