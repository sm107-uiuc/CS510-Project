XGBoost algorithm has become the ultimate weapon of many data scientists. It\u2019s a highly sophisticated algorithm, powerful enough to deal with all sorts of irregularities of data. It uses parallel computation in which multiple decision trees are trained in parallel to find the final prediction. This article is best suited to people who are new to XGBoost. We\u2019ll learn the art of XGBoost parameters tuning and XGBoost hyperparameter tuning. Also, we\u2019ll practice this algorithm using a training\u00a0data set in Python.", "Building a machine learning model using XGBoost is easy. But, improving the model using XGBoost is difficult (at least I struggled a lot). This algorithm uses multiple parameters. To improve the model, parameter tuning is a must to get the best parameter values. It is very difficult to get answers to practical questions like \u2013 Which set of parameters should you fine-tune? What is the ideal value of these parameters to obtain optimal output?", "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm. Since I covered Gradient Boosting Machine in detail in my previous article \u2013\u00a0Complete Guide to Parameter Tuning in Gradient Boosting (GBM) in Python, I highly recommend going through that before reading further. It will help you bolster your understanding of boosting in general and parameter tuning for GBM.", "I\u2019ve always admired the boosting capabilities that this algorithm infuses into a predictive model. When I explored more about its performance and the science behind its high accuracy, I discovered many advantages:", "I hope now you understand the sheer power XGBoost algorithm. Note that these are the points that I could muster. Do you know a few more? Feel free to drop\u00a0a comment below, and I will update the list.", "The overall parameters have been\u00a0divided into 3 categories by XGBoost authors:", "I will give analogies to GBM here and highly recommend reading this article\u00a0to learn from the very basics.", "These define the overall functionality of XGBoost.", "There are 2 more parameters that are set automatically by XGBoost, and you need not worry about them. Let\u2019s move on to Booster parameters.", "Though\u00a0there are 2 types of boosters, I\u2019ll consider only\u00a0tree booster\u00a0here because it always outperforms the linear booster, and thus the latter is rarely used.", "These parameters are used to define the optimization objective and the metric to be calculated at each step.", "If you\u2019ve been using Scikit-Learn till now, these parameter names might not look familiar. The good news is that the xgboost module in python has an sklearn wrapper called XGBClassifier parameters. It uses the sklearn style naming convention. The parameters names that will change are:", "You must be wondering why we have defined everything except something similar to the \u201cn_estimators\u201d parameter in GBM. Well, this exists as a parameter in XGBClassifier. However, it has to be passed as \u201cnum_boosting_rounds\u201d while calling the fit function in the standard xgboost implementation.", "I recommend you go through the following parts of the xgboost guide to better understand the parameters and codes:", "We will take the data set from Data Hackathon 3.x AV hackathon, as taken in the GBM article. The details of the problem can be found on the competition page. You can download the data set from here. I have performed the following steps:", "For those who have the original data from the competition, you can check out these steps from the data_preparation\u00a0iPython notebook in the repository.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the required libraries and loading the data.", "Note that I have imported 2 forms of XGBoost:", "Before proceeding further, let\u2019s define a function that will help us create XGBoost\u00a0models and perform cross-validation. The best part is that you can take this function as it is and use it later for your own models.", "This code is slightly different from what I used for GBM. The focus of this article is to cover the concepts and not coding.\u00a0Please feel free to drop a note in the comments if you find any challenges in understanding any part of it. Note that xgboost\u2019s sklearn wrapper doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfeature_importances\u201d metric but a get_fscore() function, which does the same job.", "We will use an\u00a0approach similar to that of GBM here. The various steps to be\u00a0performed are:", "Let us look at a more detailed step-by-step approach.", "In order to decide on boosting parameters, we need to set some initial values of other parameters. Let\u2019s take the following values:", "Please note that all the above are just initial estimates and will be tuned later. Let\u2019s take the default learning rate of 0.1 here and check the optimum number of trees using the cv function of xgboost. The function defined above will do it for us.", "As you can see that here we got 140\u00a0as the optimal estimator for a 0.1 learning rate. Note that this value might be too high for you depending on your system\u2019s power. In that case, you can increase the learning rate and re-run the command to get the reduced number of estimators.", "Note: You will\u00a0see the test AUC as \u201cAUC Score (Test)\u201d in the\u00a0outputs here. But this would not appear if you try to run the command on your system as the data is not made public. It\u2019s provided here just for reference. The part of the code which generates this output has been removed here.", "We tune these first as they will have the highest impact on the model outcome.\u00a0To start with, let\u2019s set wider ranges, and then we will perform another\u00a0iteration for smaller ranges.", "Important Note: I\u2019ll be doing some heavy-duty grid searches in this section, which can take 15-30 mins or even more time to run, depending on your system. You can vary the number of values you are testing based on what your system can handle.", "Here, we have run 12\u00a0combinations with wider intervals between values. The ideal values are 5\u00a0for max_depth and 5\u00a0for min_child_weight. Let\u2019s go one step deeper and look for optimum values. We\u2019ll search for values 1 above and below the optimum values because we took an interval of two.", "Here, we get the optimum values as 4\u00a0for max_depth and 6 for min_child_weight. Also, we can see the CV score increasing slightly. Note that as the model performance increases, it becomes exponentially difficult to achieve even marginal gains in performance. You would have noticed that here we got 6 as the optimum\u00a0value for min_child_weight, but we haven\u2019t tried values more than 6. We can do that as follow:", "We see 6 as the optimal value.", "Now let\u2019s tune the gamma value using the parameters already tuned above. Gamma\u00a0can take various values, but I\u2019ll check for 5 values here. You can go into more precise values.", "This shows that our original value of gamma, i.e., 0 is the optimum one. Before proceeding, a good idea would be to re-calibrate the number of boosting rounds for the updated parameters.", "Here, we can see the improvement in score. So the final parameters are:", "The next step would be to try different subsample and colsample_bytree values. Let\u2019s do this in 2 stages as well and take values 0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9 for both to start with.", "Here, we found 0.8 as the optimum value for both subsample and colsample_bytree.\u00a0Now we should try values in 0.05 intervals around these.", "Again we got the same values as before. Thus the optimum values are:", "The next step is to apply regularization to reduce overfitting. However, many people don\u2019t use this parameter much as gamma provides a substantial way of controlling complexity. But we should always try it. I\u2019ll tune the \u2018reg_alpha\u2019 value here and leave it up to you to try different values of \u2018reg_lambda\u2019.", "We can see that\u00a0the CV score is less than in the previous case. But the\u00a0values tried are\u00a0very widespread. We\u00a0should try values closer to the optimum here (0.01) to see if we get something better.", "You can see that we got a better CV. Now we can apply this regularization in the model and look at the impact:", "Again we can see a slight improvement in the score.", "Lastly, we should lower the learning rate and add more trees. Let\u2019s use the\u00a0cv function of XGBoost to do the job again.", "Here is a live coding window where you can try different parameters and test the results.", "Now we can see a significant boost in performance, and the effect of parameter tuning is clearer.", "As we come to an end, I would like to share\u00a02 key thoughts:", "You can also download the iPython notebook with all these model codes from my GitHub account. For codes in R, you can refer to this article.", "This tutorial was based on developing an XGBoost\u00a0machine learning model\u00a0end-to-end. We started by discussing why XGBoost has superior performance over GBM,\u00a0which was followed by a detailed discussion of the various parameters involved. We also defined a generic function that you can reuse for making models. Finally, we discussed the general approach towards tackling a problem with XGBoost\u00a0and also worked out\u00a0the AV Data Hackathon 3.x problem through that approach.", "If you\u2019re looking to take your machine learning skills to the next level, consider enrolling in our Data Science Black Belt program.

General Parameters: These parameters control the overall behavior of the XGBoost.It includes parameters like seed for random number generation, objective function to be optimized, etc.2. Booster parameters: These parameters control the gradient boosting algorithm, such as the type of booster to use, the learning rate, and the number of trees to build for parallel computation.3. Learning task parameters: These parameters control how XGBoost handles specific learning tasks. Examples of learning task parameters include the evaluation metric, the scale of the target, and the evaluation set.", "A. Overfitting, underfitting, choosing the wrong objective function, ignoring the interaction between different hyperparameters of XGBoost, and not using early stop or cross-validation to avoid overfitting are some of the most common mistakes in XGBoost Hyperparameter tuning.", "A. XGBoost is a supervised machine-learning model used for both regression and classification problems. It is widely used in Kaggle, NLP, Recommendation systems, etc.", "A. The parameters that should be tuned for XGBoost depend on the specific problem being addressed.

The three main hyperparameters in XGBoost are the learning rate, the number of trees, and the maximum depth of each tree. These hyperparameters control the overall behavior and performance of the model.", "A. XGBoost has many different hyperparameters that can be adjusted to optimize the model. Some of the key hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, the subsample ratio, and the regularization parameters.", "A. XGBoost hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the various hyperparameters of the algorithm to optimize the model\u2019s performance.
