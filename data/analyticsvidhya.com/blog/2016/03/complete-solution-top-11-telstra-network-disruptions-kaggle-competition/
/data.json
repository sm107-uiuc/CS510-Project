Telstra Network Disruptions\u00a0(TND) Competition ended on 29th February 2016. This was a recruiting competition.", "At Analytics Vidhya,\u00a0I\u2019ve been experimenting with several machine learning algorithms from past\u00a02 months. It was my time to test\u00a0the waters.\u00a0I tried several algorithms and approaches in this competition. And, I ended up securing 106 Rank out of 974 Participants.", "Though I missed the benchmark of a rank in Top 10% participants, I feel satisfied after learning several tips, best practices and approaches from several Kaggle masters via discussion forums.", "If there is one take away from the competition, it is this \u2013 \u201cPredictive Modeling is not just about using advanced machine learning algorithms, but more about data exploration and feature engineering.\u201d", "Here is my complete solution for this competition. I used XGBoost and my own ML\u00a0library. I used Python in this competition. You can learn Python using this complete tutorial.", "The idea behind this step is to think broadly about the problem WITHOUT looking at\u00a0the data. This helps us to think about the problem without getting biased.", "Telstra wants help. The problem is to predict the severity of service disruptions on their network. In other words, we are supposed to predict if a disruption occurred is a momentary glitch or total interruption of connectivity. To make this easy, a data set of service log is provided.", "This will help Telsra to enhance customer experience by providing better connectivity. The accurate predictions of service disruptions will help Telstra serve customers better.", "For this problem, I further searched on Telstra.\u00a0We know that its the largest telecommunication service providers in\u00a0mobile phones, broadband, landline as well as digital TV. Also, we know the problem.", "Let\u2019s try to think about parameters from a user\u2019s perspective which can potentially influence this factor:", "These are just a few\u00a0examples to get you thinking and you can perform hypothesis further. Let\u2019s look at the data now and see what we have got!", "Data set is available for download here. Let\u2019s have a good look at the data and summarize the key points:", "Let\u2019s have a look at the individual files and derive some insights.", "Generally, I tend to combine both the train and test files\u00a0for analysis by adding a source feature which keeps record of where the observation belongs. After combination, the data looks like:", "Lets move to\u00a0preparing this data for first analysis.", "The first step was to clean and map the given data and prepare test and train files. The idea is not do something new but simply use the available information and make a model which will act as the baseline to test further modifications.", "The data preparation step involves making features from different information files and mapping them back to the train and test files. The codes can be found in the data_preparation_1\u00a0iPython notebook from my GitHub repository.", "I adopted the following approach for event_type, resource_type and log_features file, all of which had multiple occurrences\u00a0\u00a0for each id:", "The overall idea is to keep categories which occur a certain minimum number of times and club the rest. This is done\u00a0to ensure that the rules are made on certain minimum number of samples. The same can also be enforced using model parameters. But, taking all the unique entities would give ~450 features and models would run really slow.", "Let\u2019s take an example of event_type.\u00a0I created a dataframe of unique entities which looked like:", "First column is the count, then the percentage in train, then mode of fault_severity and then the final decision taken. This data is sorted by count and you can see that the higher counts are all kept as it is in \u201cpreprocess\u201d column.\u00a0If we look at the lower end of this table:", "Here, you find the low count entities have been combined into \u201cevent_type others_0/1/2\u201d. Also, the ones only present in test file are removed. Finally sparse features are made by mapping\u00a0this table into\u00a0original data.", "Similar steps have been performed for other files as well. Some points to note:", "Though location should ideally be converted to sparse features, but it has too many unique values\u00a0\u2013\u00a01126 to be precise.\u00a0So\u00a0following steps were taken:", "This data was used to make the first model using xgboost. I used xgboost here directly because one of my aim during this competition was to learn xgboost. Also, I started learning it around 10 days before end of competition and I didn\u2019t get\u00a0much time to experiment. I couldn\u2019t have got a better opportunity!", "I\u00a0tuned a xgboost model with the data set. I could see that the numeric coding of location was actually working as location was the most significant variable in my first model:", "The final model build was using the following parameters:", "It scored\u00a00.50710 on the public leaderboard. I was still\u00a0in the bottom 50% with this score and there was a lot to improve upon.", "After making my first submission, I noticed something strange. The leaderboard had a\u00a0peculiar\u00a0trend. The top ~15 people had a score 0.42-0.44 and below that it was all above 0.48. There was a abrupt change from\u00a00.44 to\u00a00.48 with nothing in between. This was a clear indication of leakage!", "If you\u2019re wondering what is leakage, it is nothing but some information which was not supposed to be present but got overlooked\u00a0by mistake. It can be of various kinds, for instance:", "Type 1 is easy to find\u00a0because the algorithm will automatically detect it for us. However, Type 2 is really hard to find and requires some serious exploration. In this case, it was definitely type 2 for two reasons. One, the algorithm didn\u2019t detect something very different and two, we were expecting some time information in the data which was not given. So there are high chances that people found some time-trend in the data.", "I tried various things on my file:", "The intuition for #4 and #6 came from a thesis report which I read on analyzing telecommunication networks. The pattern features came out to be important in the feature importance chart but there was no significant probably. Apparantly, xgboost was already learning about such patterns without those features.", "When all efforts were in vain, I created some other features which gave slight improvements in performance:", "You can have a look at the various things I tried in the\u00a0feature_engineering_1/2/3 iPython notebook in my GitHub repository.", "I was still in range\u00a0of\u00a00.5 mark with these efforts. Towards the end, I started thinking about creating ensemble models. The most basic form is to create 10 different models with the same parameters and different seeds and average their results. I was surprised to see that my performance suddenly improved to ~0.499 with this kind of ensembling. I did this for all my good performing models and averaged them again. This also lead to some slight improvement.", "Then I read about stacking technique. Stacking is nothing but using the output of the model as input and then running again. But there is a catch here, you should always use out-of-fold predictions, else there will be serious over-fitting. The typical process I followed is:", "I tried first by stacking xgboost with another xgboost, i.e. the model made on each half was an xgboost and the model on the predicted outcomes was also an xgboost. This gave slight improvement.", "Then I tried making different models in intermediate step. I made random forest and extra-trees classifier model with \u2018ginni\u2019 and \u2018entropy\u2019 losses. Then, I used the xgboost model to stack their outcome. This gave me a good boost to ~0.498.", "You might be wondering that so much effort for 0.499 to 0.498! But yes this is what Kaggle competitions are all about \u2013 extracting every bit of performance possible. And it gave me a good 50-100 position boost. Also, these models are more robust and the chances of performing good on private leaderboard are high.", "Now I had to choose my model for final submission. While reading on how to do it, Kaggle masters suggested to determine a combination of CV and leaderboard score. Something like this:", "Another trick I tried here was to make ensemble of all of my \u2018good\u2019 models, i.e. ones ~0.498 mark. The ones which I created with ensemble to 10 models of different seeds. I was surprised to get a jump from 0.498 to 0.493 using this. I was really starting to understand the power of ensemble and how robust can different models be. I finally submitted this model and the next best. Without any surprises, the top model performed best and gave me a private leaderboard score of 0.485.", "This can be found in the \u2018ensemble_models\u2019 iPython notebook at the GitHub repository.", "My final rank was 106 out of 974 participants, which is ~11% from top. I was sad that I missed the top 10% mark but was still satisfying as this was my first attempt at Kaggle. I was still very curious to see what that \u201cmagic feature\u201d was which I couldn\u2019t spot. I was praying that it shouldn\u2019t turn out to be something very simple which I missed. You know, it hurts a lot.", "It was exactly what I didn\u2019t expect. I was looking at the wrong place. I mapped information from all the additional files into the train and test file. All my attempts were in this while the trend was safely hidden in those additional files. Those files were sorted by location and then by time. Just creating a simple index out of it gave a performance of 0.42! I was kicking myself for missing out on that, but still learnt a lot.", "A very interesting and informative blog has been written by the Daria Vasyukova (aka dune_dweller) who ranked 31 in the competition.", "Apart from this, I have hand-picked some interesting features\u00a0made by top performers from\u00a0Kaggle forums and summarized them here for you:", "You can read further about the approaches from\u00a0Kaggle forum.", "In this article, I described my approach in a\u00a0recent Kaggle competition \u2013 Telstra Network Disruption, where the type of disruption had to be predicted. The competition was a good one and required some out-of-the-box thinking more than predictive modeling. Though I didn\u2019t do wonders, but it was a good learning experience. I\u2019m sure this will help you in making some informed decisions in your upcoming data science competitions.", "Did you like the methods shared here?
