NO!", "In this article, I\u2019ve attempted to explain the concept of neural network in simple words. Understanding this article requires a\u00a0little\u00a0bit of biology and lots of patience. By end of this article, you would become a confident analyst ready to start working with neural networks. In case you don\u2019t understand anything, I\u2019m always available in comments section.", "Note: This article is best suited for intermediate users in data science & machine learning. Beginners might find it\u00a0challenging.", "Neural Networks (NN), also called as Artificial Neural Network is named after\u00a0its\u00a0artificial representation of working of a human being\u2019s nervous system. Remember this diagram ? Most of us have been\u00a0taught in High School !", "Flashback Recap: Lets start by understanding how our nervous system works.\u00a0Nervous System\u00a0comprises of millions of nerve cells or neurons. A neuron has the following structure:", "In simple terms, each neuron takes input from numerous other neurons through the dendrites. It then\u00a0performs the required processing on the input and sends another electrical pulse through the axiom into the terminal nodes from where it is transmitted to numerous other neurons.", "ANN works in a very similar fashion. The general structure of a neural network looks like:Source", "This figure depicts a typical neural network with working of a single neuron explained separately. Let\u2019s understand this.", "The input to\u00a0each\u00a0neuron are like the dendrites. Just like in\u00a0human nervous system, a neuron (artificial though!) collates all the inputs and performs an operation on them. Lastly, it transmits the output to all other neurons (of the next layer) to which it is connected. Neural Network is divided into layer of 3 types:", "Lets start by looking into the functionality of each neuron with examples.", "In this section, we will explore the working of a single neuron with\u00a0easy examples. The idea is to give you some intuition on how a neuron compute outputs using the inputs. A typical neuron looks like:", "Here f is known\u00a0an activation function. This makes a Neural Network extremely flexible and imparts the capability to estimate complex non-linear relationships in data. It can be a gaussian function, logistic function, hyperbolic function or even a linear function in simple cases.", "Lets implement\u00a03 fundamental functions\u00a0\u2013 OR, AND, NOT using Neural Networks. This will help us understand how they work. You can assume these to be like a classification problem where we\u2019ll predict the output (0\u00a0or\u00a01) for different combination of inputs.", "We will model these like linear classifiers with the following activation function:", "The AND function can be implemented as:", "The output of this neuron is:", "The truth table for this implementation\u00a0is:", "Here we can see that the AND function is successfully implemented. Column \u2018a\u2019 complies with \u2018X1 AND X2\u2019. Note that here the bias unit weight is -1.5. But it\u2019s not a fixed value. Intuitively, we can understand it as anything which makes the total value positive only when both x1 and x2 are positive. So any value between (-1,-2) would work.", "The OR\u00a0function can be implemented as:", "The output of this neuron is:", "The truth table for this implementation is:", "Column \u2018a\u2019 complies with \u2018X1 OR X2\u2019.\u00a0We can see that, just by changing the bias unit weight, we can implement an OR function. This is very similar to the one above. Intuitively, you can understand that here, the bias unit is such that the weighted sum will be positive if any of x1 or x2 becomes positive.", "Just like the previous cases, the NOT\u00a0function can be implemented as:", "The output of this neuron is:", "The truth table for this implementation is:", "Again, the compliance with desired value proves functionality.\u00a0I hope with these examples, you\u2019re getting some intuition into how a neuron inside a Neural Network works. Here I have used a very simple activation function.", "Note: Generally a\u00a0logistic function will be\u00a0used in place of what I used here because it is differentiable and makes determination of a gradient possible. There\u2019s just 1 catch. And, that is, it outputs floating value and not\u00a0exactly 0 or 1.", "After understanding the working of a single neuron, lets try to understand how a Neural Network can model complex relations using multiple layers. To understand this further, we will take the example of an XNOR function. Just a recap, the truth table of an XNOR function looks like:", "Here we can see that the output is 1 when both inputs are same, otherwise 0. This sort of a relationship cannot be modeled using a single neuron. (Don\u2019t believe me? Give it a try!) Thus we will use a multi-layer network. The idea behind using multiple layers is that complex relations can be broken into simpler\u00a0functions and combined.", "Lets break down the XNOR function.", "Now we can implement it using any of the simplified cases. I will show you how to implement this using 2 cases.", "Here the challenge is to\u00a0design a neuron to model A\u2019.B\u2019 . This can be easily modeled using the following:", "The output of this neuron is:", "The truth table for this\u00a0function is:", "Now that we have modeled the individual components and we can combine them using a multi-layer network. First, lets look at the semantic diagram of that network:", "Here we can see that in layer 1, we will determine A\u2019.B\u2019 and A.B individually. In layer 2, we will take their output and implement an OR function on top. This would complete the entire Neural Network. The final network would look like this:", "If you notice carefully, this is nothing but a combination of the different neurons which we have already drawn. The different outputs represent different units:", "The functionality can be verified using the truth table:", "I think now you can get some intuition into how multi-layers work. Lets do another implementation of the same case.", "In the above example, we had to separately calculate A\u2019.B\u2019. What if we want to implement the function just using the basic AND, OR, NOT functions. Consider the following semantic:", "Here you can see that we had to use 3 hidden layers. The working will be similar to what we did before. The network looks like:", "Here\u00a0the neurons perform following actions:", "Note that, typically a neuron feeds into every other neuron of the next layer except the bias unit. In this case, I\u2019ve obviated few connections from layer 1 to layer 2. This is because their weights are 0 and adding them will make it visually cumbersome to grasp.", "Finally, we have successfully implemented XNOR function. This method is more complicated than case 1. Hence, you should prefer case 1 always. But the idea here is to show how complicated functions can be broken down in multiple layers. I hope the advantages of multiple layers are clearer now.", "Now that we had a look at some basic examples, lets define a generic structure in which every Neural Network\u00a0falls. We will also see the equations to be followed to determine the output given an input. This is known as\u00a0Forward Propagation.", "A generic Neural Network\u00a0can be defined as:", "It has L layers with 1 input layer, 1 output layer and L-2\u00a0hidden layers.\u00a0Terminology:", "Since the the output of each layer forms the input of next layer, lets define the equation to determine the output of i+1th layer using output of ith layer as input.", "The input to the i+1th layer are:", "The weights matrix from ith to i+1th layer is:", "The output of the i+1th layer can be calculated as:", "Using these equations for each subsequent layer, we can determine the final output. The number of neurons in the output layer will depend on the type of problem. It can be 1 for regression or binary classification problem or multiple for multi-class classification problems.", "But this is just determining the output from 1 run. The ultimate objective is to update the weights of the model in order to minimize the loss function. The weights are updated using a back-propogation algorithm which we\u2019ll study next.", "Back-propagation (BP) algorithms works by determining the loss (or error) at the output and then propagating\u00a0it back into the network. The weights are updated to minimize the error resulting from each neuron. I will not go in details of the algorithm but I will try to give you some intuition into how it works.", "The first step in minimizing the error is to determine the gradient of each node wrt. the final output. Since, it is a multi-layer network, determining the gradient is not very straightforward.", "Let\u2019s understand the\u00a0gradients for multi-layer networks. Lets take a step back from neural networks and consider a very simple system as following:", "Here there are 3 inputs which simple processing as:", "Now we need to determine the gradients of a,b,c,d wrt the output e. The following cases are very straight forward:", "However, for determining the gradients for a and b, we need to apply the chain rule.", "And, this way the\u00a0gradient can be computed by simply multiplying the gradient of the input to a node with that of the output of that node. If you\u2019re still confused, just read the equation carefully 5 times and you\u2019ll get it!", "But, the actual cases are not that simple. Let\u2019s take another example. Consider a case where a single input is being fed into multiple items in the next layer as this is almost always the case with neural network.", "In this case, the gradients of all other will be very similar to the above example except for \u2018m\u2019 because m is being fed into 2 nodes. Here, I\u2019ll show how to determine the gradient for m and rest you should calculate on your own.", "Here you can see that the gradient is simply the summation of the two different gradients. I hope the cloud cover is slowly vanishing and things are becoming lucid. Just understand these concepts and we\u2019ll come back to this.", "Before moving forward, let\u2019s sum up the entire process behind optimization of a neural network. The various steps involved in each iteration are:", "Till now we have covered #1 \u2013 #3 and we have some intuition into #5. Now lets start from #4 \u2013 #6. We\u2019ll use the same generic structure of NN as described in section 4.", "Here y(i) is the actual outcome from training data", "#5- Back-propogating the error into the network", "The error for layer L-1 should be determined first using the following:", "Intuition from the concepts discussed in former half of this section:", "This process has to be repeated consecutively from L-1th layer to 2nd layer. Note that the first layer is just the inputs.", "#6- Update weights to minimize gradient", "I hope the convention is clear. I suggest you go through it multiple times and if still there are questions, I\u2019ll be happy to take them on through comments below.", "With this we have successfully understood how a neural network\u00a0works. Please feel free to discuss further if needed.", "This article is focused on the fundamentals of a Neural Network and how it works. I hope now you understand the working of a neural network and wouldn\u2019t use it as a black box ever.
