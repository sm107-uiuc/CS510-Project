In case of R, the problem gets accentuated by the fact that various algorithms would have different syntax, different parameters to tune and\u00a0different requirements on the data format. This could be too much for a beginner.", "So, then how do you transform from a beginner to a data scientist building hundreds of models and stacking them together?\u00a0There certainly isn\u2019t any shortcut but what I\u2019ll tell you today will make you capable of applying hundreds of machine learning models without having to:", "All this has been made possible by the years of effort that have gone behind CARET ( Classification And Regression Training) which is possibly the biggest project in R. This package alone is all you need to know for solve almost any supervised machine learning problem. It provides a uniform interface to several machine learning algorithms and standardizes various other tasks such as Data splitting, Pre-processing, Feature selection, Variable importance estimation, etc.", "To get an in-depth overview of various functionalities provided by Caret, you can refer to this article.", "Today, we\u2019ll work on the Loan Prediction problem-III to show you the power of Caret package.", "P.S. While caret definitely simplifies the job to a degree, it can not take away the hard work and practice you need to put in to become a master at machine learning.", "To put in simple words, Caret is essentially a wrapper for 200+ machine learning algorithms. Additionally, it provides several features which makes it a one stop solution for all the modeling needs for supervised machine learning problems.", "Caret tries not to load all the packages it depends upon at the start. Instead, it loads them only when the packages are needed. But it does assume that you already have all the algorithms installed on your system.", "To install Caret on your system, use the following command. Heads up: It might take some time:", "Now, let\u2019s get started using caret package on Loan Prediction 3 problem:", "In this problem, we have to predict the Loan Status of a person based on his/ her profile.", "We need to pre-process our data before we can use it for modeling. Let\u2019s check if the data has any missing values:", "Next, let us\u00a0use Caret to impute these missing values using KNN algorithm. We will predict these missing values based on other attributes for that row. Also, we\u2019ll scale and center the numerical data by using the convenient preprocess() in Caret.", "It is also very easy to use one hot encoding in Caret to create dummy variables for each level of a categorical variable. But first, we\u2019ll convert the dependent variable to numerical.", "Now, creating dummy variables using one hot encoding:", "Here, \u201cfullrank=T\u201d will create only (n-1) columns for a categorical column with n different levels. This works well particularly for the representing categorical predictors like gender, married, etc. where we only have two levels: Male/Female, Yes/No, etc. because 0 can be used to represent one class while 1 represents the other class in same column.", "We\u2019ll be creating a cross-validation set from the training set to evaluate our model against. It is important to rely more on the cross-validation set for the actual evaluation of your model otherwise you might end up overfitting the public leaderboard.", "We\u2019ll use createDataPartition() to split our training data into two sets : 75% and 25%. Since, our outcome variable is categorical in nature, this function will make sure that the distribution of outcome variable classes will be similar in both the sets.", "Feature selection is an extremely crucial part of modeling. To understand\u00a0the\u00a0importance of feature selection and various techniques used for feature selection, I strongly recommend that you to go through my previous article. For now, we\u2019ll be using Recursive Feature elimination which is a wrapper method to find the best subset of features to use for modeling.", "This is probably the part where Caret stands out from any other available package. It provides the ability for implementing 200+ machine learning algorithms using consistent syntax. To get a list of all the algorithms that Caret supports, you can use:", "To get more details of any model, you can refer here.", "We can simply apply a large number of algorithms with similar syntax. For example, to apply, GBM, Random forest, Neural net and Logistic regression :", "You can proceed further tune the parameters in all these algorithms using the parameter tuning techniques.", "It\u2019s extremely easy to tune parameters using Caret. Typically, parameter tuning in Caret is done as below:", "It is possible to customize almost every step in the tuning process. The resampling technique used for evaluating the performance of the model using a set of parameters in Caret by default is bootstrap, but it provides alternatives for using k-fold, repeated k-fold as well as Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) which can be specified using trainControl(). In this example, we\u2019ll be using 5-Fold cross-validation repeated 5 times.", "If the search space for parameters is not defined, Caret will use 3 random values of each tunable parameter and use the cross-validation results to find the best set of parameters for that algorithm. Otherwise, there are two more ways to tune parameters:", "To find the parameters of a model that can be tuned, you can use", "Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using\u00a0 the largest value.", "The final values used for the model were n.trees = 10, interaction.depth = 1, shrinkage =\u00a00.05 and n.minobsinnode = 3", "Thus, for all the parameter combinations that you listed in expand.grid(), a model will be created and tested using cross-validation. The set of parameters with the best cross-validation performance will be used to create the final model which you get at the end.", "Instead, of specifying the exact values for each parameter for tuning we can simply ask it to use any number of possible values for each tuning parameter through tuneLength. Let\u2019s try an example using tuneLength=10.", "Tuning parameter \u2018shrinkage\u2019 was held constant at a value of 0.1", "Tuning parameter \u2018n.minobsinnode\u2019 was held constant at a value of 10", "Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using\u00a0 the largest value.", "The final values used for the model were n.trees = 50, interaction.depth = 2, shrinkage =\u00a00.1 and n.minobsinnode = 10.", "Here, it keeps the shrinkage and n.minobsinnode parameters constant while alters n.trees and interaction.depth over 10 values and uses the best combination to train the final model with.", "Caret also makes the variable importance estimates accessible with the use of varImp() for any model. Let\u2019s have a look at the variable importance for all the four models that we created:", "Clearly, the variable importance estimates of different models differs and thus might be used to get a more holistic view of importance of each predictor. Two main uses of variable importance from various models are:", "For predicting the dependent variable for the testing set, Caret offers predict.train(). You need to specify the model name, testing data. For classification problems, Caret also offers another feature named type which can be set to either \u201cprob\u201d or \u201craw\u201d. For type=\u201draw\u201d, the predictions will just be the outcome classes for the testing data while for type=\u201dprob\u201d, it will give probabilities for the\u00a0occurrence of each observation in various classes of the outcome variable.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the predictions from our GBM model:", "Caret also provides a confusionMatrix function which will give the confusion matrix along with various other metrics for your predictions. Here is the performance analysis of our GBM model:", "Caret is one of the most powerful and useful packages ever made in R. It alone has the capability to fulfill all the needs for predictive modeling from preprocessing to interpretation. Additionally, its syntax is also very easy to use. If you use R, I\u2019ll encourage you to use Caret.", "Caret is a very comprehensive package and instead of covering all the functionalities that it offers, I thought it\u2019ll be a better idea to show an end-to-end implementation of Caret on a real hackathon J dataset. I have tried to cover as many functions in Caret as I could, but Caret has a lot more to offer. For going in depth, you might find the resources mentioned above\u00a0very useful.
