It gives you a lot of insight into how you perform against the best on a level playing field.", "Initially, I used to believe that machine learning is going to be all about algorithms \u2013 know which one to apply when and you will come on the top. When I got there, I realized that was not the case \u2013 the winners were using the same algorithms which a lot of other people were using.", "Next, I thought surely these people would have better / superior machines. I discovered that is not the case. I saw competitions being won using a MacBook Air, which is not the best computational machine. Over time, I realized that there are 2 things which distinguish winners from others in most of the cases: Feature Creation and Feature Selection.", "In other words, it boils down to creating variables which capture hidden business insights and then making the right choices about which variable to choose for your predictive models! Sadly or thankfully, both these skills require a ton of practice. There is also some art involved in creating new features \u2013 some people have a knack of finding trends where other people struggle.", "In this article, I will focus on one of the 2 critical parts of getting your models right \u2013 feature selection. I will discuss in detail why feature selection plays such a vital role in creating an effective predictive model.", "If you are interested in exploring the concepts of feature engineering, feature selection and dimentionality reduction, check out the following comprehensive courses \u2013", "Machine learning works on a simple rule \u2013 if you put garbage in, you will only get garbage to come out. By garbage here, I mean noise in data.", "This becomes even more important when the number of features are very large. You need not use every feature at your disposal\u00a0for creating\u00a0an algorithm. You can assist your algorithm by feeding in only those features that are really important. I have myself witnessed feature subsets giving better results than complete set of feature for the same algorithm. Or as Rohan Rao puts it \u2013 \u201cSometimes, less is better!\u201d", "Not only in the competitions but this can be very useful in industrial applications\u00a0as well. You not only reduce the training time and the evaluation time, you also have less things to worry about!", "Top reasons to use feature selection are:", "Next, we\u2019ll discuss various methodologies and techniques that you can use to subset your feature space and help your models perform better and efficiently. So, let\u2019s get started.", "Filter methods are generally used as a preprocessing step. The selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The correlation is a subjective term here. For basic guidance, you can refer to the following table for defining correlation co-efficients.", "One thing that should be kept in mind is that filter methods do not remove multicollinearity. So, you must deal with multicollinearity of features as well before training models for your data.", "In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from your subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. These methods are usually computationally very expensive.", "Some common examples of wrapper methods are forward feature selection, backward feature elimination, recursive feature elimination, etc.", "One of the best ways for implementing feature selection with wrapper methods is to use Boruta package that finds the importance of a feature by creating shadow features.", "It works in the following steps:", "For more information on the\u00a0implementation of Boruta package, you can refer to this article :", "For the\u00a0implementation of Boruta in python, refer can refer to this article.", "Embedded methods combine the qualities\u2019 of filter and wrapper methods. It\u2019s implemented by algorithms that have their own built-in feature selection methods.", "Some of the most popular examples of these methods are LASSO and RIDGE regression which have inbuilt penalization functions to reduce overfitting.", "For more details and implementation of LASSO and RIDGE regression, you can refer to this article.", "Other examples of embedded methods are Regularized trees, Memetic algorithm, Random multinomial logit.", "The main differences between the filter and wrapper methods for feature selection are:", "Let\u2019s use wrapper methods for feature selection and see whether we can improve the accuracy of our model by using an intelligently selected subset of features instead of using every feature at our disposal.", "We\u2019ll be using stock prediction data in which we\u2019ll predict whether the stock will go up or down based on 100 predictors in R. This dataset contains 100 independent variables from X1 to X100 representing profile of a stock and one outcome variable Y with two levels : 1 for rise in stock price and -1 for drop in stock price.", "To download the dataset, click here.", "Let\u2019s start with applying random forest for all the features on the dataset first.", "Now, instead of trying a large number of possible subsets through say forward selection or backward elimination, we\u2019ll keep it simple by using the top 20 features only to build a Random forest. Let\u2019s find out if it can improve the accuracy of our model.", "So, by just using 20 most important features, we have improved the accuracy from 0.452 to 0.476. This is just an example of how feature selection makes a difference. Not only we have improved the accuracy but by using just 20 predictors instead of 100, we have also:", "I believe that his article has given you a good idea of how you can perform feature selection to get the best out of your models. These are the broad categories that are commonly used for feature selection. I believe you will be convinced about the potential uplift in your model that you can unlock using feature selection and added benefits of feature selection.", "Did you enjoy reading this article? \u00a0Do share your views in the comment section below.", "Saurav is a Data Science enthusiast, currently in the final year of his graduation at MAIT, New Delhi.
