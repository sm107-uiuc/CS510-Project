It\u2019s the aha! factor which\u00a0most companies seek in a data scientist. The ability of make justifiable and quick decisions can make\u00a0any candidate stand out for a job.", "More than 1200 participants from all over the world registered for this competition. Winners\u00a0were chosen on the basis of RMSE score.", "Since time was limited, we decided to provide a relatively simple data set. A time series problem was given. The data set had\u00a0fewer variables. Therefore, participants got more time to focus\u00a0on modeling techniques rather than data exploration.", "This battle of intense coding and machine learning algorithms continued for 3 hours.\u00a0Winners took the smartest way of all. Below are the top 3 winners:", "Here is the final rankings of all participants: Leaderboard", "For your learning purpose, below is the complete approach, solution and codes used by top 3 winners.\u00a0", "Note: I would like to sincerely thank our winners for their immense cooperation and patience shown in sharing their competition experience.", "In this mini-hack, I followed a\u00a0similar approach, I\u00a0used\u00a0in previous edition of\u00a0mini hack (explained here. This time also, my best model\u00a0was a weighted average of XGBoost model and Linear Regression. Yes, linear regression is an under-dog but powerful team player.", "It was evident from the date variable that it contained a lot of information. So, I created new time based features:", "I used these features as input variables to\u00a0the model. These two models (XGBoost and Regression) did a fairly good job in capturing the variation in sales and the increasing trend.", "Then, I did data exploration, just to ensure that I don\u2019t miss out on visible patterns in the data. Interestingly, when I created\u00a0a scatterplot of sales, I saw that there were two points way higher than the rest of the sales (about 70x of the median value). When probed deeper, I found out the dates\u00a0were 25th Dec 2007 and 24th Dec 2008. Also, being\u00a0the last working day on both these years, I thought this higher sales could be due to:", "After this information, when I re-checked my model output, I found that this pattern (higher sales during Christmas) didn\u2019t get captured. So, I thought of\u00a0creating a separate variable (a binary variable like Christmas flag) to capture this trend.", "But, due to time constraint I couldn\u2019t do it satisfactorily.\u00a0So, I just did a manual correction for Christmas Eve sales and made the final submission. I am fairly sure that because of this last step, I ended up at 3rd position. Had I got few more minutes, I might have done better.", "In the end, it was an amazing learning experience. I learned that it is essential to do some data exploration even if we use powerful algorithms as sometimes they might fail to capture the obvious patterns.", "Unlike full fledged long hours hackathons, the key to crack a 3 hour mini hack is just being smart\u00a0at handling the data.", "In 3 hour, you don\u2019t get\u00a0the luxury of trying out many\u00a0different approaches ( because you\u2019ve limited time), so adopting a\u00a0smart approach will give\u00a0you a definite\u00a0competitive advantage.", "But, I\u00a0tried several methods\u00a0to deal with given time series data. After progressing through failed attempts, I finally found the model which helped me secure 2nd position. So, here\u2019s a quick review of my approach used:", "Method 1 \u2013 As a no-brainer , I started\u00a0with times series (decomposition and forecasting)\u00a0concepts\u00a0to\u00a0check for trend and seasonality. Then, I eliminated the unsual trends to avoid biasness and built an ARIMA model. With this method, I became aware of the\u00a0hidden patterns in the data. Though, the forecast values were pretty off target, but starting here did give me a base to improve upon.", "Method 2 \u2013 After scrutinizing the data, I found out that the data had abnormally high sales on Christmas Eve and September (which I believe is due to festive season). Beyond these abnormal observations, the random fluctuations in the time series seem to be roughly constant in size over time. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be incorrect to describe the data using an additive model. Thus,\u00a0I made\u00a0forecasts using simple exponential smoothing i.e. Holt Winter\u2019s model. But again the results were unsatisfactory. Still, I kept trying.", "Method 3 \u2013 The forecast package in R contains functions to make forecasts using Neural Networks with nnetar function. I tried it and got\u00a0slightly better results. Yet,\u00a0I was still way down the leaderboard.", "Method 4 \u2013 This time I thought of doing something drastically different.\u00a0I eliminated the outliers, gave higher weight to recent data, generated a feature \u2018month\u2019 and categorized it\u00a0as high sale and low sale. Then, I generated a week day feature (weekends generally had more sales) and finally\u00a0used a simple XGBOOST model with random hyper parameter tuning using MLR package in R. This did the trick.", "It was great fun participating in this competition.\u00a0As someone who has studied and learnt statistical and analytical concepts from IIT, IIM and ISI, I want to state that AV\u2019s blog, tutorials and competitions have been\u00a0of great help to understand\u00a0statistical concepts\u00a0better and to\u00a0keep up with the latest developments in the field. AV\u2019s competitions also draws significant interest from my batchmates here. Thank you for making them so interesting.", "This was my first hack @ AV. I joined the hack pretty late and didn\u2019t have much time left. When I explored\u00a0the data, I found\u00a0evidence of year on year trend and some seasonality (specially year end sales). Sales were also erratic at places.", "So, with limited time in hand, I decided to build a model using\u00a0exponential smoothing time series method.\u00a0This helped me fetch the winning model.", "Had I started earlier, I would have ideally captured seasonal elements separately like weekly seasonal indices, holiday seasonal indices (using some generic holiday calendar) and the trend part.\u00a0 With the de-seasonalized data, I would have predicted daily forecast using any of the time series model and multiplied the seasonal and trend components to it.", "Overall\u00a0 I enjoyed the experience and look forward to participating in many more hacks to come.", "The motive of this article is to make you familiar with simple & advanced techniques used in a time series problem. Here are the key takeaways from this article:", "It was a wonderful experience interacting with these winners and knowing about their secretive coding styles.
