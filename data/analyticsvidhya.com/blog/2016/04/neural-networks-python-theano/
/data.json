If you\u2019ve been following this series, today we\u2019ll become familiar with practical process of implementing neural network in Python (using Theano package).", "I found various other packages also such as Caffe, Torch, TensorFlow etc to do this job. But, Theano is no less than and satisfactorily execute all the tasks. Also, it has multiple benefits which further enhances the coding experience\u00a0in Python.", "In this article, I\u2019ll\u00a0provide a comprehensive practical guide to implement Neural Networks using Theano. If you are here for just python codes, feel free to skip the sections and learn at your pace. And, if you are new to Theano, I suggest you to follow the article sequentially to gain complete knowledge.", "In short, we can define Theano as:", "As popularly known, Theano was developed at the University of Montreal in 2008. It is\u00a0used for defining and evaluating mathematical expressions in general.", "Theano has several features which\u00a0optimize the processing time of expressions. For instance\u00a0it\u00a0modifies the symbolic expressions we define before converting them to C codes. Examples:", "Below are some powerful\u00a0advantages of using Theano:", "Let\u2019s now focus on Theano (with example) and try to understand it as a programming language.", "Lets start by implementing a simple mathematical expression, say a multiplication in Theano and see how the system works. In later sections, we will take a deep dive into individual components.\u00a0The general structure of a Theano code works in 3 steps:", "Lets look at the following code for simply multiplying 2 numbers:", "Here, we have simply imported 2 key functions of theano \u2013 tensor and function.", "Here 2 variables are defined. Note that we have used Theano tensor object type here. Also, the arguments passed to dscalar function are just name of tensors which are useful while debugging. They\u00a0code will work even without them.", "Here we have defined a function f which has 2 arguments:", "Now we are simply calling the function with the 2 inputs and we get the output as a multiple of the two. In short, we saw how we can define mathematical expressions in Theano and evaluate them. Before we go into complex functions, lets understand some inherent properties of Theano which will be useful in building neural networks.", "Variables are key building blocks of any programming language. In Theano, the objects are defined as tensors. A tensor can be\u00a0understood as a generalized form of a vector with dimension t. Different dimensions are analogous\u00a0to different types:", "Watch this\u00a0interesting video to get\u00a0a deeper level of intuition into vectors and tensors.", "These variables can be defined similar to our definition of \u2018dscalar\u2019 in the above code. The various keywords for defining variables are:", "Now you understand that\u00a0we can define variables with different memory allocations and dimensions. But this is not an exhaustive list. We can define dimensions higher than 4 using a generic TensorType class. You\u2019ll find more details here.", "Please note that variables of these types are just symbols. They don\u2019t have a fixed value and are passed into functions as symbols. They only take values when a function is called. But, we often need variables which are constants and which we need not pass in all the functions. For this Theano provides shared variables. These have a fixed value and are not of the types discussed above. They can be defined as\u00a0numpy\u00a0data types or simple constants.", "Lets take an example. Suppose, we initialize\u00a0a shared variable as 0 and use a function which:", "Note that here function has an additional argument called updates. It has to be a list of lists or tuples, each containing 2 elements of form (shared_variable, updated_value).\u00a0The output for 3 subsequent runs is:", "You can see that for each run, it returns the square of the present value, i.e. the value before updating. After the run, the value of shared variable gets updated. Also, note that shared variables have 2 functions \u201cget_value()\u201d and \u201cset_value()\u201d which are used to read and modify the value of shared variables.", "Till now we saw the basic structure of a function and how it handles shared variables.\u00a0Lets move forward and discuss couple more things we can do with functions:", "We can return multiple values from a function. This can be easily done as shown in following example:", "We can see that the output is an array with the square and cube of the number passed into the function.", "Gradient computation is one of the most important part of training a deep learning model. This can be done easily in Theano. Let\u2019s define a function as the cube of a variable and determine its gradient.", "This returns 48 which is 3x2 for x=4. Lets see how Theano has implemented this derivative using the pretty-print feature as following:", "In short, it can be explained as: fill(x3,1)*3*x3-1 You can see that this is exactly the derivative of x3. Note that fill(x3,1) simply means to make a matrix of same shape as x3 and fill it with 1. This is used to handle high dimensionality input and can be ignored in this case.", "We can use Theano to compute Jacobian and Hessian matrices as well which you can find here.", "There are various other aspects of Theano like conditional and looping constructs.\u00a0You can go into further detail using following resources:", "Lets start by modeling a single neuron.", "Note that I will take examples from my previous article on neuron networks here. If you wish to go in the detail of how these work, please read this article. For modeling a neuron, lets adopt a 2 stage process:", "Lets implement an AND gate\u00a0for this purpose.", "An AND gate can be implemented as:", "Now we will define a feed forward network which takes inputs and uses the shown weights to determine the output. First we will define a neuron which computes the output a.", "I have simply used the steps we saw above. If you are not sure\u00a0how this expression works, please refer to the neural networks article I have referred above. Now let\u2019s test out all values in the truth table and see if the AND function has been implemented as desired.", "Note that, in this case we had to provide weights while calling the function. However, we will be required to update them while training. So, its better that we define them as a shared variable. The following code implements w as a shared variable. Try this out and you\u2019ll get the same output.", "Now the feedforward step is complete.", "Now we have to modify the above code and perform following additional steps:", "Lets initialize the network as follow:", "Note that, you will notice a change here as compared to above program. I have defined x as a matrix here and not a vector. This is more of a vectorized approach where we will determine all the outputs together and find the total cost which is required for determining the gradients.", "You should also keep in mind\u00a0that I am using the full-batch gradient descent here, i.e. we will use all training observations to update the weights.", "Let\u2019s determine the cost as follows:", "In this code, we have defined a_hat as the actual observations. Then we determine the cost using a simple logistic cost function since this is a classification problem. Now lets compute the gradients and define a means to update the weights.", "In here, we are first computing gradient of the cost w.r.t. the weights for inputs and bias unit. Then, the train function here does the weight update job. This is an elegant but tricky approach where the weights have been defined as shared variables and the updates argument of the function is used to update them every time a set of values are passed through the model.", "Here we have simply defined the inputs, outputs and trained the model. While training, we have also recorded the cost and its plot shows that our cost reduced towards zero and then finally saturated at a low value. The output of the network also matched the desired output closely. Hence, we have successfully implemented and trained a single neuron.", "I hope you have understood the last section. If not, please do read it multiple times and proceed to this section. Along with learning Theano, this will enhance your understanding of neural networks on the whole.", "Lets consolidate our understanding\u00a0by taking a 2-layer example. To keep things simple, I\u2019ll take the XNOR example like in my previous article. If you wish to explore the nitty-gritty of how it works, I recommend reading the previous\u00a0article.", "The XNOR function can be implemented as:", "As a reminder, the truth table of XNOR function is:", "Now we will directly implement both feed forward and backward at one go.", "In this step we have defined all the required variables as in the previous case. Note that now we have 3 weight vectors corresponding to each neuron and 2 bias units corresponding to 2 layers.", "Here we have simply defined mathematical expressions for each neuron in sequence. Note that here an additional step was required where x2 is determined. This is required because we want the outputs of a1 and a2 to be combined into a matrix whose dot product can be taken with the weights vector.", "This is very similar to the previous case. The key difference being that now we have to determine the gradients of 3 weight vectors and 2 bias units and update them accordingly.", "We can see that our network has successfully learned the XNOR function. Also, the cost of the model has reduced to reasonable limit. With this, we have successfully implemented a 2-layer network.", "In this article, we understood the basics of Theano package in Python and how it acts as a programming language. We also implemented some basic neural networks using Theano. I am sure that implementing Neural Networks on Theano will enhance your understanding of NN on the whole.", "If hope you have been able to follow till this point, you really deserve a pat on your back. I can understand that Theano is not a traditional plug and play system like most of sklearn\u2019s ML models. But the beauty of neural networks lies in their flexibility and an approach like this will allow you a high degree of\u00a0customization in models. Some high-level wrappers of Theano do exist like Keras and Lasagne which you can check out. But I believe knowing the core of Theano will help you in using them.", "Did you find this article useful ?
