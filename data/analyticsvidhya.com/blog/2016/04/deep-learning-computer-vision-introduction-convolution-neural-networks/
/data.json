We all know robots have already reached a testing phase in some of the powerful countries of the world. Governments, large companies are spending billions in developing this ultra-intelligence creature.\u00a0The recent existence of robots have gained attention of many research houses across the world.", "Does it excite you as well ? Personally for me, learning about robots & developments in AI started with\u00a0a deep curiosity and excitement in me! Let\u2019s learn about computer vision today.", "The earliest research in computer vision started way back in 1950s. Since then, we have\u00a0come\u00a0a long way but still find ourselves far from the ultimate objective. But with neural networks and deep learning, we have become empowered like never before.", "Applications of deep learning in vision have taken this technology to a different level and made\u00a0sophisticated things\u00a0like self-driven cars possible in near future.\u00a0In this article, I will also introduce you to Convolution Neural Networks which form the crux of deep learning applications in computer vision.", "Note: This article is inspired by\u00a0Stanford\u2019s Class on Visual Recognition.

You\u2019d be surprised to know that\u00a0it took decades of research to discover and\u00a0impart the ability of\u00a0detecting an object to\u00a0a computer with reasonable accuracy.", "The field of computer vision has witnessed continual\u00a0advancements in the past 5 years. One of the most stated advancement is Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs).\u00a0Today, deep CNNs form the crux of most\u00a0sophisticated fancy computer vision application, such as self-driving cars, auto-tagging of friends in our facebook pictures, facial security features, gesture recognition, automatic number plate recognition, etc.", "Let\u2019s get familiar with it a bit more:", "Object detection is considered to be the most basic application of computer vision. Rest of the other developments in computer vision are achieved by making small enhancements on top of this. In real life, every time we(humans) open our eyes, we unconsciously detect objects.", "Since it is super-intuitive for us, we fail to appreciate the key challenges involved when we try to design systems similar to our eye. Lets start by looking at some of the key roadblocks:", "These are just some of the challenges which I brought up so that you can appreciate the complexity of the tasks which your eye and brain duo does with such utter ease. Breaking up all these challenges and solving individually is still possible today in computer vision. But we\u2019re still decades away from a system which can get anywhere close to our human eye (which can do everything!).", "This brilliance of our\u00a0human body is the reason why researchers have been trying to break the enigma of computer vision by analyzing the visual mechanics of humans or other animals. Some of the earliest work in this direction was done by Hubel and Weisel with their famous cat experiment in 1959. Read more about it here.", "This was the first study which emphasized the importance of edge detection for solving the computer vision problem. They were rewarded the\u00a0nobel prize for their work.", "Before diving into convolutional neural networks, lets take a quick overview of the traditional or rather elementary\u00a0techniques used in computer vision\u00a0before deep learning became popular.", "Various techniques, other than deep learning are available enhancing computer vision. Though, they work well for simpler problems, but as the data become huge and the task becomes complex, they are no substitute for deep CNNs. Let\u2019s briefly discuss two simple approaches.", "I hope this gives some intuition into the challenges faced by approaches other than deep learning. Please note that more sophisticated techniques can be used than the ones discussed above but they would rarely beat a deep learning model.", "Let\u2019s discuss some properties of\u00a0a neural networks. I will skip the basics of neural networks here as I have already covered that in my previous article \u2013\u00a0Fundamentals of Deep Learning \u2013 Starting with Neural Networks.", "Once your fundamentals are sorted, let\u2019s learn in detail some important concepts such as\u00a0activation functions, data preprocessing, initializing weights and dropouts.", "There are various activation functions which can be used and this is an active area of research. Let\u2019s discuss some of the popular options:", "To summarize, ReLU is\u00a0mostly the activation function of choice.\u00a0If the caveats are kept in mind, these can be used very efficiently.", "For images, generally the following preprocessing steps are done:", "Note that normalization is generally not done in images.", "There can be various techniques for initializing weights. Lets consider a few of them:", "One more thing must be remembered while using ReLU as activation function. It is that the weights initialization might be such that some of the neurons might not get activated because of negative input. This is something that should be checked. You might be surprised to know that 10-20% of the ReLUs might be dead at a particular time while training and even in the end.", "These were just some of the concepts I discussed here. Some more concepts can be of importance like batch normalization, stochastic gradient descent, dropouts which I encourage you to read on your own.", "Before going into the details, lets first try to get some intuition into why deep networks work better.", "As we learned\u00a0from the drawbacks of earlier approaches, they are unable to cater to the vast amount of variations in images. Deep\u00a0CNNs work by consecutively modeling small pieces of information and combining them deeper in network.", "One way to understand them is that the first layer will try to detect edges and form templates for edge detection. Then subsequent layers will try to combine them into simpler shapes and eventually into templates of different object positions, illumination, scales, etc. The final layers will match an input image with all the templates and the final prediction is like a weighted sum of all of them. So, deep CNNs are able to model complex variations and behaviour giving highly accurate predictions.", "There is an interesting paper on visualization of deep features in CNNs which you can go through to get more intuition \u2013\u00a0Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization.", "For the purpose of explaining CNNs and finally showing an example,\u00a0I will be using the CIFAR-10 dataset for explanation here and you can download the data set from here. This dataset has 60,000 images with 10 labels and 6,000 images of each type. Each image is colored and 32\u00d732 in size.", "A CNN typically consists of 3 types of layers:", "You might find some batch normalization layers in some old CNNs but they are not used these days. We\u2019ll consider these one by one.", "Since convolution layers form the crux of the network, I\u2019ll consider them first. Each layer can be visualized in the form of a\u00a0block or a cuboid. For instance in the case of CIFAR-10 data, the input layer would have the following form:", "Here you can see, this is the original image which is 32\u00d732 in height and width. The depth here is 3 which corresponds to the Red, Green and Blue colors, which form the basis of colored images. Now a convolution layer is formed by running a filter over it. A filter is another block or cuboid of smaller height and width but same depth which is swept over this base block. Let\u2019s consider a filter of size 5x5x3.", "We start this filter from the top left corner and sweep it till the bottom left corner. This filter is nothing but a set of eights, i.e. 5x5x3=75 + 1 bias = 76 weights. At each position, the weighted sum of the pixels is calculated as WTX + b and a new value is obtained. A single filter will result in a volume of size 28x28x1 as shown above.", "Note that multiple filters are generally run at each step. Therefore, if 10 filters are used, the output would look like:", "Here the filter weights are parameters which are learned during the back-propagation step. You might have noticed that we got a 28\u00d728 block as output when the input was 32\u00d732. Why so? Let\u2019s look at a simpler case.", "Suppose the initial image had size 6x6xd and the filter has size 3x3xd. Here I\u2019ve kept the depth as d because it can be anything and it\u2019s immaterial as it remains the same in both.\u00a0Since depth is same, we can have a look at the front view of how filter would work:", "Here we can see that the result would be 4x4x1 volume block. Notice there is a single output for entire depth of the each location of filter. But you need not do this visualization all the time. Let\u2019s define a generic case where image has dimension NxNxd and filter has FxFxd. Also, lets define another term stride (S) here which is the number of\u00a0cells (in above matrix) to move in each step. In the above case, we had a stride of 1 but it can be a higher value as well. So the size of the output will be:", "You can validate the first case where N=32, F=5,\u00a0S=1. The output had 28 pixels which is what we get from this formula as well. Please note that some S values might result in non-integer result and we generally don\u2019t use such values.", "Let\u2019s consider an example to consolidate our understanding. Starting with the same image as before of size 32\u00d732, we need to apply 2 filters consecutively, first 10 filters of size 7, stride 1 and next 6 filters of size 5, stride 2. Before looking at the solution below, just think about 2 things:", "Notice here that the size of the images is getting shrunk consecutively. This will\u00a0be undesirable in case of deep networks where the size would\u00a0become very small too early. Also, it would restrict the use of large size filters as they would result in faster size reduction.", "To prevent this, we generally use a stride of 1 along with\u00a0zero-padding of size (F-1)/2. Zero-padding is nothing but adding additional zero-value pixels towards the border of the image.", "Consider the example we saw above with 6\u00d76 image and 3\u00d73 filter. The required padding is (3-1)/2=1. We can visualize the padding as:", "Here you can see that the image now becomes 8\u00d78 because of padding of 1 on each side. So now the output will be of size 6\u00d76 same as the original image.", "Now let\u2019s summarize a convolution layer as following:", "Some additional points to be taken into consideration:", "Having understood the convolution layer, lets move on to pooling layer.", "When we use padding in convolution layer, the image size remains same. So, pooling layers are used to reduce the size of image. They work by sampling in each layer using filters. Consider the following 4\u00d74 layer. So if we use a 2\u00d72 filter with stride 2 and max-pooling, we get the following response:", "Here you can see that 4 2\u00d72 matrix are combined into 1 and their maximum value is taken. Generally, max-pooling is used but other options like average pooling can be considered.", "At the end of convolution and pooling layers, networks generally use fully-connected layers in which each pixel is considered as a separate neuron just like a regular neural network. The last fully-connected layer will contain as many neurons as the number of classes to be predicted. For instance, in CIFAR-10 case, the last fully-connected layer will have 10 neurons.", "I recommend reading the prior section multiple times and getting a hang of the concepts before moving forward.", "In this section, I will discuss the AlexNet architecture in detail. To give you some background, AlexNet is the winning solution of IMAGENET Challenge 2012. This is one of the most reputed computer vision challenge and 2012 was the first time that a deep learning network was used for solving this problem.", "Also, this resulted in a significantly better result as compared to previous solutions. I will share the network architecture here and review all the concepts learned above.", "The detailed solution has been explained in this paper. I will explain the overall architecture of the network here. The AlexNet consists of a 11 layer CNN with the following architecture:", "Here you can see 11 layers between input and output. Lets discuss each one of them individually. Note that the output of each layer will be the input of next layer. So you should keep that in mind.", "I understand this is a complicated structure but once you understand the\u00a0layers, it\u2019ll give you a much better understanding of the architecture. Note that you\u00a0fill find a different representation of the structure if you look at the AlexNet paper. This is because at that GPUs were not very powerful and they used 2 GPUs for training the network. So the work processing was divided between the two.", "I highly encourage you to go through the other advanced solutions of ImageNet challenges after 2012 to get more ideas of how people design these networks. Some of interesting solutions are:", "This video gives a brief overview and comparison of these solutions towards the end.", "Having understood the theoretical concepts, lets move on to the fun part (practical) and make a basic CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset which we\u2019ve downloaded before.", "I\u2019ll be using GraphLab for the purpose of running algorithms. Instead of GraphLab, you are free to use\u00a0alternatives tools such as\u00a0Torch, Theano, Keras, Caffe, TensorFlow, etc. But GraphLab allows a quick and dirty implementation as it takes care of the weights initializations and network architecture\u00a0on its own.", "We\u2019ll work on the CIFAR-10 dataset which you can download\u00a0from\u00a0here. The first step is to load the data. This data is packed in a specific format which can be loaded using the following code:", "We can verify this data by looking at the head and shape of data as follow:", "Since we\u2019ll be using graphlab, the next step is to convert this into a graphlab SFrame and run neural network. Let\u2019s convert the data first:", "GraphLab has a functionality of automatically creating a neural network based on the data. Lets run that as a baseline model before going into an advanced model.", "Here it used a simple fully connected network with 2 hidden layers and 10 neurons each. Let\u2019s evaluate this model on test data.", "As you can see that we have a pretty low accuracy of ~15%. This is because it is a very fundamental network. Lets try to make a CNN now. But if we\u00a0go about training a deep CNN from scratch, we will face the following challenges:", "To overcome these challenges, we can use pre-trained networks. These are nothing but networks like AlexNet which are pre-trained on many images and the weights for deep layers have been determined. The only challenge is to find a pre-trianed network which has been trained on images similar to the one we want to train. If the pre-trained network is not made on images of similar domain, then the features will not exactly make sense and classifier will not be of higher accuracy.", "Before proceeding further, we need to convert these images into the size used in ImageNet which we\u2019re using for classification. The GraphLab model is based on 256\u00d7256 size images. So we need to convert our images to that size. Lets do it using the following code:", "Here we can see that a new column of type graphlab image has been created but the images are in 32\u00d732 size. So we convert them to 256\u00d7256 using following code:", "Now we can see that the image has been converted into the desired size. Next, we will load the ImageNet pre-trained model in graphlab and use\u00a0the features created in its last layer into a simple classifier and make predictions.", "Lets start by loading the pre-trained model.", "Now we have to use this model and extract features which will be passed into a classifier. Note that the following operations may take a lot of computing time. I use a Macbook Pro 15\u2033 and I had to leave it for whole night!", "Lets have a look at the data to make sure we have the features:", "Though, we have the features with us, notice here that lot of them are zeros. You can understand this as a result of smaller data set. ImageNet was created on 1.2Mn images. So there would be many features in those images that don\u2019t make sense for this data, thus resulting in zero outcome.", "Now lets create a classifier using graphlab. The advantage with \u201cclassifier\u201d\u00a0function is that it will automatically create various classifiers and chose the best model.", "The final model selection is based on a validation set with 5% of the data. The results are:", "So we can see that\u00a0Boosted Trees Classifier has been chosen as the final model. Let\u2019s look at the results on test data:", "So we can see that the test accuracy is now ~50%. It\u2019s a decent jump from 15% to 50% but there is still huge potential to do better. The idea here was to get you started and I will skip the next steps. Here are some things which you can try:", "You can find many open-source\u00a0solutions for this dataset which give >95% accuracy. You should check those out. Please feel free to try them and post your solutions in comments below.", "Now, its time to take the plunge and actually play with some other real datasets. So are you ready to take on the challenge? Accelerate your deep learning journey with the following Practice Problems:", "In this article, we covered the basics of computer vision using deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). We started by appreciating the challenges involved in designing artificial systems which mimic the eye. Then, we looked at some of the traditional techniques, prior to deep learning, and\u00a0got some intuition into their drawbacks.", "We moved on to understanding the some aspects of tuning a\u00a0neural networks such as activation functions, weights initialization\u00a0and data-preprocessing. Next, we got some intuition into why deep CNNs should work better than traditional approaches and we understood the\u00a0different elements present in a general deep CNN.", "Subsequently, we consolidated our understanding by analyzing the architecture of AlexNet, the winning solution of ImageNet 2012 challenge.
