It\u2019s just a matter of time until we discover it and start believing in ourselves.\u00a0We all have limitations, but should we stop there? No.", "When I started coding in R, I struggled. Sometimes a lot more than one can ever think! Because I had never ever coded even <Hello World> in my entire life. \u00a0My situation was similar to a guy who didn\u2019t know swimming but was manhandled into deep ocean, who somehow saved himself from drowning but ended up gulping lot of salty water.", "Now when I look back, I laugh at myself. Do you know why? Because, I could have chosen one of several\u00a0non-coding tools available for data analysis, and could\u2019ve avoided the suffering.", "Data exploration is an inevitable part of predictive modeling. You can\u2019t make predictions unless you know what happened in the past. The most important skill to master data exploration is \u2018curiosity\u2019, which is\u00a0free of cost\u00a0yet\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0owned by everyone.", "I have written this article to help you acknowledge various free tools available for exploratory data analysis. Now a days, ample of tools are available in the market which are free & quite interesting to work with.

It\u2019s also more than just data mining tool. Rattle supports various ML algorithms such as Tree, SVM, Boosting, Neural Net, Survival, Linear models etc.", "It\u2019s being widely used these days. According to CRAN, Rattle is being installed 10000 times every month. It provides enough options to explore, transform and model data in just a few clicks. However, it has fewer options than SPSS for statistical analysis. Although, SPSS is a paid tool while Rattle is free of cost.", "Qlikview is one of the most popular tools in the business intelligence industry around the world. Deriving business insights and presenting it in an awesome manner, is what this tool does. With it\u2019s state of the art visualization capabilities, you\u2019d be amazed by the amount of control you get while working on data. It has an inbuilt recommendation engine to update you from time to time about the best visualization methods while working on data sets.", "However, it is not a statistical software. Qlikview is incredible at exploring data, trends, insights but it can\u2019t prove anything statistically. In that case, you might want to look at other softwares.", "An advantage of using Weka is that it is easy to learn. Being a machine learning tool, its interface is intuitive enough for you to get the job done quickly. It provides options for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules and visualization. Most of the steps you think of while model building can be achieved using Weka. It is built on Java.", "Initially, it was designed for research purposes at University of Wakaito, but later it got accepted by more and more people around the world. However, over time I haven\u2019t seen an enthusiastic Weka community like that of R and Python. The tutorial listed below should help you more.", "Similar to RapidMiner, KNIME offers an open source analytics platform for analyzing data, which can later be deployed, scaled using other supportive KNIME products. This tool has an abundance of features on data blending and visualization, and advanced machine learning algorithms. Yes, using this tool you can build models as well. Although, there hasn\u2019t been enough talk about this tool, but considering its state of the art design, I think it will soon come under much needed limelight.", "Moreover, quick training lessons are available on their website to get you started with this tool right now.", "As cool as its sounds, this tool is designed to produce interactive data visualizations and data mining tasks. There are enough youtube tutorials to learn this tool. It has an extensive library of data mining tasks which includes all classification, regression, clustering methods. Along with this, the versatile visualizations which get formed during data analysis allow us to understand the data more closely.", "To build any model, you\u2019ll be required\u00a0\u00a0to create a flowchart. This is interesting as it would help us further understand the exact procedure of data mining tasks.", "Tableau is a data visualization software. We can say, tableau and qlikview are the most powerful sharks in the business intelligence ocean. The comparison of superiority is never ending. It\u2019s a fast visualization software which let\u2019s you explore data, every observation using various possible charts. It\u2019s intelligent algorithms figure out by self about the type of data, best method available etc.", "If you want to understand data in real time, tableau can get the job done.

It\u2019s visualization bucket comprises of line chart, bar chart, column chart, pie chart, stacked bar chart and maps. So, it\u2019s a basic software and can\u2019t be compared with giants like tableau and qlikview. This tool is browser enabled and doesn\u2019t require any software installation.", "It is a powerful tool designed to connect technology, business and data. It is available in two segments: Coding & Non-Coding. It\u2019s a complete package for any organization which aims to develop, build, deploy and scale models on network. DSS is also powerful enough to create smart data applications to solve real world problems. It comprises of features which facilitates team integration on projects. Among all features, the most interesting part is, you can reproduce your work in DSS as every action in the system is versioned through an integrated GIT repository.", "It started as Google Refine but looks like google plummeted this project due to reasons unclear. However, this tool is still available renamed as Open Refine. Among the generous list of open source tools, openrefine specializes in messy data; cleaning, transforming and shaping it for predictive modeling purposes. As an interesting fact, during model building, 80% time of an analyst is spent in data cleaning. Sounds unpleasant, but it\u2019s a fact. Using openrefine, analysts can not only save their time, but put it to use for productive work.", "Decision making these days is largely driven by data. Managers & professionals no longer take gut-based decisions. They require a tool which can help them quickly. Talend can help them to explore data and support their decision making. Precisely, it\u2019s a data collaboration tool capable of clean, transform and visualize data.", "Moreover, it also offers an interesting automation feature where you can save and redo your previous task on a new data set.
