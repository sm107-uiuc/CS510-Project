The thrill of finding a solution in a time bound, high pressure, competitive situation is addictive. However, if you are participating in a data science hackathon for the first time, the experience can be a bit intimidating.", "Which tool should you pick? Which is the best algorithm to apply on the problem statement? How do you even begin to contemplate the steps and the structure required to succeed in a hackathon?", "If you have been thinking about taking the plunge and participating in your first hackathon, this is the perfect guide for you! Even if you have taken part in a few hackathons, read on to get some tips on how you can potentially improve on your previous attempts.", "First things first, let us spend a few minutes understanding how data science / machine learning hackathons are different from other hackathons you might have attended in the past. For people participating in a data science hackathon for the first time, the experience can be a bit overwhelming. Why?", "There could be several reasons for this:", "I hope this has given you a fair idea about what goes on during a data science hackathon.", "If you are preparing for an upcoming hackathon, you don\u2019t have a lot of time to debate on this, and trust me it ends up helping more than restricting you in many ways. If you know any of these tools already, just use that tool / language and run with it. Focus on problem solving rather than learning a new tool.", "If you are completely new to data science and don\u2019t know any of the above tools \u2013 just pick Python and it will serve you well. I don\u2019t want to start a language war here \u2013 but my reasons for picking Python are that it is easier to learn and comes in handy with a larger ecosystem and production readiness. It is also clearly the most popular language currently being using in areas like deep learning.", "I assume you have either gone through the resources mentioned above, or have experience of solving a few practice problems in the past.", "So, you have been doing data science for some time now and you know the work flow well. You have mastered the art of handling different kind of variables and applied it to a few problems already. You would also have participated and got a high rank in a few hackathons already. Now is the time to put on your flying boots!", "At this point, you should have all the technical resources you need to make a killing in a hackathon. But, mastering the art of winning a hackathon actually takes much more than these technical skills. I have included a few (behavioural) tips from my experience. You can also read the tips from some of the past winners here.", "So, if I was a first time hackathon participant, I would make sure I understand the data science workflow well. I would focus on using one tool \u2013 likely Python for the ease of it (but this isn\u2019t set in stone) and make sure I focus on getting my fundamentals right. Believe me, this should be enough to make a splash! So what are you waiting for \u2013 go, make your mark!", "If you have any questions about gearing up for the hackathons, please feel free to ask them here. Alternately, if you have a suggestion which I have missed out highlighting \u2013 please add it below in the comments.", "Kunal is a post graduate from IIT Bombay in Aerospace Engineering.
