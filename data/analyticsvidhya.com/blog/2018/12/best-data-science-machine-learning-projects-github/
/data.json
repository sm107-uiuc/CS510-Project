Ask any data scientist, and they\u2019ll point you towards GitHub. It has been a truly revolutionary platform in recent years and has changed the landscape of how we host and even do coding.", "But that\u2019s not all. It acts as a learning tool as well. How, you ask? I\u2019ll give you a hint \u2013 open source!", "The world\u2019s leading tech companies open source their projects on GitHub by releasing the code behind their popular algorithms. 2018 saw a huge spike in such releases, with the likes of Google and Facebook leading the way. The best part about these releases is that the researchers behind the code also provide pretrained models so folks like you and I don\u2019t have to waste time building difficult models from scratch.", "Additionally, we regularly see the top trending repositories aimed towards coders and developers \u2013 this includes resources like cheatsheets, video links, e-books, research paper links, among other things. No matter which level you are at in your professional career (beginner, established or advanced), you will always find something new to learn on GitHub.", "2018 was a transcendent one in a lot of data science sub-fields, as we will shortly see. Natural Language Processing (NLP) was easily the most talked about domain within the community with the likes of ULMFiT and BERT being open-sourced. In my quest to bring the best to our awesome community, I ran a monthly series throughout the year where I hand-picked the top 5 projects every data scientist should know about. You can check out the entire collection below:", "There will be some overlap here with my article covering the biggest breakthroughs in AI and ML in 2018. Do check out that article as well \u2013 it is essentially a list of all the major developments I feel everyone in this field needs to know about. As a bonus, there are predictions from experts as well \u2013 not something you want to miss. \ud83d\ude42", "And now, get ready to explore new projects in your quest to attain data science stardom in 2019 and scroll down! Simply click on each project title to head over to the code repository on GitHub.", "Let\u2019s get the ball rolling with a look at the top projects in terms of tools, libraries and frameworks. Since we are speaking about a software repository platform, it feels right to open things with this section.", "Technology is advancing rapidly and computational costs are lower than ever, so we\u2019re being treated to one massive release after another. Can we call this the golden age of coding in machine learning? That is an open question, but one thing we can all agree on \u2013 it\u2019s a great time to be a programmer in data science. In this section (and the article overall), I have tried to diversify the languages as much as possible, but Python inevitably ruled the roost. ", "How about all you .NET developers wanting to learn a bit of machine learning to complement your existing skills? Here\u2019s the perfect repository to get that idea started! ML.NET, a Microsoft project, is an open-source machine learning framework that allows you design and develop models in .NET.", "You can even integrate existing ML models into your application, all without requiring explicit knowledge of how ML models are developed. ML.NET is actually used in multiple Microsoft products, like Windows, Bing Search, MS Office, among others.", "ML.NET runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.", "Machine learning in the browser! A fictional thought a few years back, a stunning reality now. A lot of us in this field are welded to our favorite IDEs, but TensorFlow.js has the potential to change your habits. It\u2019s become a very popular release since it\u2019s release earlier this year and continues to amaze with its flexibility.", "As the repository states, there are primarily three major features of TensorFlow.js:", "If you\u2019re familiar with Keras, the high-level layers API will seem quite familiar. There are plenty of examples available on the GitHub repository, so check those out to quicken your learning curve.", "What a year it has been for PyTorch. It has won the hearts and now projects of data scientists and ML researchers around the globe. It is easy to grasp, flexible, and is already being implemented across high profile researches (as you\u2019ll see later in this article). The latest version (v1.0) already powers many Facebook products and services at scale, including performing 6 billion text translations a day. If you\u2019ve been wondering when to start dabbling with PyTorch, the time is NOW.", "If you\u2019re new to this field, ensure you check out Faizan Shaikh\u2019s guide to getting started with PyTorch.", "While not strictly a tool or framework, this repository is a gold mine for all data scientists. Most of us struggle with reading through a paper and then implementing it (at least I do). There are a lot of moving parts that don\u2019t seem to work on our machines.", "And that\u2019s where \u2018Papers with Code\u2019 comes in. As the name suggests, they have a code implementation of all the major papers that have been released in the last 6 years or so. It is a mind-blowing collection that you will find yourself fawning over. They have even added code from papers presented at NIPS (NeurIPS) 2018. Get yourself over there now!", "Thanks to falling computational costs and a surge of breakthroughs from the top researchers (something tells me those two might be linked), deep learning is accessible to more people than ever before. And within deep learning, computer vision projects are ubiquitous \u2013 most of the repositories you\u2019ll see in this section will cover one computer vision technique or another. ", "It is simply the hottest field in deep learning right now and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Whether it\u2019s object detection or pose estimation, there\u2019s a repository for seemingly all computer vision tasks. Never a better time to get acquainted with these developments \u2013 a lot of job openings might come your way soon.", "Detectron made a HUGE splash when it was launched in early 2018. Developed by Facebook\u2019s AI Research team (FAIR), it implements state-of-the-art object detection frameworks. It is (surprise, surprise) written in Python and has helped enable multiple projects, including DensePose (which we will talk about soon).", "This repository contains the code and over 70 pretrained models. Too good an opportunity pass up, would\u2019t you agree?", "Object detection in images is awesome, but what about doing it in videos? And not just that, can we extend this concept and translate the style of one video to another? Yes, we can! It is a really cool concept and NVIDIA have been generous enough to release the PyTorch implementation for you to play around with.", "The repository contains videos of how the technique looks, the full research paper, and of course the code. The Cityscapes dataset, available publicly post registration, is used in NVIDIA\u2019s examples. One of my favorite projects from 2018.", "Training a deep learning model in 18 minutes? While not having access to high-end computational resources? Believe me, it\u2019s already been done. Fast.ai\u2019s Jeremy Howard and his team of students built a model on the popular ImageNet dataset that even outperformed Google\u2019s approach.", "I encourage you to at least go through this project to get a sense of how these researchers structured their code. Not everyone has access to multiple GPUs (or even one) so this was quite a win for the minnows.", "Another research paper collection repository! It\u2019s always helpful to know how your subject of choice has evolved over a span of multiple years, and this one-stop shop will help you do just that for object detection. It\u2019s a comprehensive collection of papers from 2014 till date, and even include code wherever possible.", "The above image shows how object detection frameworks have evolved and transformed in the last five years. Quite fascinating, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s even a 2019 entry included, so you have quite a lot of catching up to do.", "Let\u2019s turn our attention to the field of pose detection. I came across this concept this year itself and have been fascinated with it ever since. That above image captures the essence of this repository \u2013 dense human pose estimation in the wild.", "The code to train and evaluate your own DensePose-RCNN model is included here. There are notebooks available as well to visualize the DensePose COCO dataset. Pretty good place to kick off your pose estimation learning.", "The above image (taken from a video) really piqued my interest.\u00a0I covered the release of the research paper\u00a0back in August and have continued to be in awe of this technique. This technique enables us to transfer the motion between human objects in different videos. The video I mentioned is available within the repository \u2013 it will blow your mind!", "This repository further contains the PyTorch implementation of this approach. The amount of intricate details this approach is capable of picking up and replicating is incredible.", "I\u2019m sure most of you must have come across a GAN application (even if you perhaps didn\u2019t realize it at the time). GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks, were introduced by Ian Goodfellow back in 2014 and have caught fire since. They specilize in performing creative tasks, especially artistic ones. Check out this amazing introductory guide by Faizan Shaikh to the world of GANs, along with an implementation in Python.", "We saw a plethora of GAN based projects in 2018 and hence I wanted to create a separate section for this.", "Let\u2019s start off with one of my favorites. I want you to take a moment to just admire the above images. Can you tell which one was done by a human and which one by a machine? I certainly couldn\u2019t. Here, the first frame is the input image (original) and the third frame has been generated by this technique.", "Amazing, right? The algorithm adds an external object of your choosing to any image and manages to make it look like nothing touched it. Make sure you check out the code and try to implement it on a different set of images yourself. It\u2019s really, really fun.", "What if I gave you an image and asked you to extend the boundaries by imagining what it would look like when the entire scene was captured? You would understandably turn to some image editing software. But here\u2019s the awesome news \u2013 you can achieve it in a few lines of code!", "This project is a Keras implementation of Stanford\u2019s Image Outpainting paper (incredibly cool and illustrated paper \u2013 this is how most research papers should be!).\u00a0You can either build a model from scratch or use the one provided by this repository\u2019s author. Deep learning wonders never cease to amaze.", "If you haven\u2019t got a handle on GANs yet, try out this project. Pioneered by researchers from MIT\u2019s CSAIL division, it helped you visualize and understand GANs. You can explore what your GAN model has learned by inspecting and manipulating it\u2019s neurons.", "I would like to point you towards the official MIT project page, which has plenty of resources to get you familiar with the concept, including a video demo.", "This algorithm enables you to change the facial expression of any person in an image. It\u2019s as exciting as it is concerning. The images above inside the green border at the originals, the rest have been generated by GANimation.", "The link contains a beginner\u2019s guide, data preparation resources, prerequisites, and the Python code. As the author mentioned, do NOT use it for immoral purposes.", "This project is quite similar to the Deep Painterly Harmonization one we saw earlier. But it deserved a mention given it came from NVIDIA themselves. As you can see in the image above, the FastPhotoStyle algorithm requires two inputs \u2013 a style photo and a content photo. The algorithm then works in one of two ways to generate the output \u2013 it either uses photorealistic image stylization code or uses semantic label maps.", "The computer vision field has the potential to overshadow other work in deep learning but I wanted to highlight a few projects outside it.", "Audio processing is another field where deep learning has started to make it\u2019s mark. It\u2019s not just limited to generating music, you can do tasks like audio classification, fingerprinting, segmentation, tagging, etc. There is a lot that\u2019s still yet to be explored and who knows, perhaps you could use these projects to pioneer your way to the top.", "Here are two intuitive articles to help you get acquainted with this line of work:", "And here comes NVIDIA again. WaveGlow is a flow-based network capable of generating really high quality audio. It is essentially a single network for speech synthesis.", "This repository includes a PyTorch implementation of WaveGlow along with a pre-trained model which you can download. The researchers have also listed down the steps you can follow if you want to train your own model from scratch.", "Want to discover your own planet? That might perhaps be overstating things a bit, but this AstroNet repository will definitely get you close. The Google Brain team discovered two new planets in December 2017 by applying AstroNet. It\u2019s a deep neural network meant for working with astronomical data. It goes to show the far-ranging applications of machine learning and was a truly monumental development.", "And now the team behind the technology has open sourced the entire code (hint: the model is based on CNNs!) that powers AstroNet.", "Who doesn\u2019t love visualizations? But it can get a tad bit intimidating to imagine how a deep learning model works \u2013 there are too many moving parts involved. But VisualDL does a great job mitigating those challenges by designing specific deep learning jobs.", "VisualDL currently supports the below components for visualizing jobs (you can see examples of each in the repository):", "Surprised to see NLP so down in this list? That\u2019s primarily because I covered almost all the major open source releases in this article. I highly recommend checking out that list to stay on top of your NLP game. The frameworks I have mentioned here include ULMFiT, Google\u2019s BERT, ELMo, and Facebook\u2019s PyText. I will briefly mention BERT and a couple of other respositories here as I found them very helpful.", "I couldn\u2019t possibly let this section pass by without mentioning BERT. Google AI\u2019s release has smashed records on it\u2019s way to winning the hearts of NLP enthusiasts and experts alike.\u00a0Following ULMFiT and ELMo, BERT really blew away the competition with it\u2019s performance. It obtained state-of-the-art results on 11 NLP tasks.", "Apart from the official Google repository I have linked to above, a PyTorch implementation of BERT is worth checking out. Whether it marks a new era of not in NLP we will soon find out.", "It often helps to know how well your model is performing against a certain benchmark. For NLP, and specifically deep text matching models, I have found the MatchZoo toolkit quite reliable.\u00a0Potential tasks related to MatchZoo include:", "MatchZoo 2.0 is currently under development so expect to see a lot more being added to this already useful toolkit.", "This repository was created by none other than Sebastian Ruder. The aim of this project is to track the latest progress in NLP. This includes both datasets and state-of-the-art models.", "Any NLP technique you\u2019ve ever wanted to know more about \u2013 there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll already be present here. The repository covers both traditional and core NLP tasks such as reading comprehension and parts-of-speech tagging. It\u2019s mandatory to star/bookmark this repository if you\u2019re even vaguely interested in this field.", "What an year for AutoML. With industries look to integrate machine learning into their core mission, the need to data science specialists continues to grow. There is currently a massive gap between the demand and the supply. This gap could potentially be filled by AutoML tools.", "These tools are designed for those people who do not have data science expertise. While there are certainly some incredible tools out there, most of them are priced significantly higher than most individuals can afford. So our amazing open source community came to the rescue in 2018, with two high profile releases.", "This made quite a splash upon it\u2019s release a few months ago. And why wouldn\u2019t it? Deep learning has been long considered a very specialist field, so a library that can automate most tasks came as a welcome sign. Quoting from their official site, \u201cThe ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background\u201d.", "You can install this library from pip:", "The repository contains a simple example to give you a sense of how the whole thing works. You\u2019re welcome, deep learning enthusiasts. \ud83d\ude42", "AdaNet is a framework for automatically learning high-quality models without requiring programming expertise. Since it\u2019s a Google invention, the framework is based on TensorFlow. You can build ensemble models using AdaNet, and even extend it\u2019s use to training a neural network.", "The GitHub page contains the code, an example, the API documentation, and other things to get your hands dirty. Trust me, AutoML is the next big thing in our field.", "Since I already covered a few reinforcement learning releases in my 2018 overview article, I will keep this section fairly brief. My hope in including a RL section where I can is to foster a discussion among our community and to hopefully accelerate research in this field.", "First, make sure you check out OpenAI\u2019s Spinning Up repository, an exhaustive educational resource for beginners. Then head over to Google\u2019s Dopamine page. It is a research framework for accelerating research in this still nascent field. Now let\u2019s look at a couple of other resources as well.", "If you follow a few researchers on social media, you must have come across the above images in video form. A stick human running across a terrain, or trying to stand up, or some such sort. That, dear reader, is reinforcement learning in action.", "Here is a signature example of it \u2013 a framework to train a simulated humanoid to imitate multiple motion skills. You can get the code, examples, and a step-by-step run-through on the above link.", "This repository is a collection of reinforcement learning algorithms from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto\u2019s book and other research papers. These algorithms are presented in the form of Python notebooks.", "As the author of this repo mentioned, you will only truly learn if you implement the learning as you go along. It\u2019s a complex topic, and giving up or reading the resources like a storybook will lead you nowhere.", "And that bring us to the end of our journey for 2018. What a year! It was a joyful ride putting this article together and I learned a lot of new stuff along the way.", "I would love to hear your feedback on this article. Which repository have you used?
