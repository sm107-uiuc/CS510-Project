And that\u2019s especially true of a field that\u2019s as vast as deep learning.", "There\u2019s no shortage of datasets to hone your skills \u2013 but where should you start? Which datasets are the best at building your profile? And can you get domain specific datasets which will help you get acquainted with that line of work? To help you out, we scoured the internet and hand-picked the top 25 open deep learning datasets.", "These datasets are divided into three categories:", "So pick your interest and get started today!", "Ah, the curse of dimensionality. We all appreciate more data, it always helps to have a large enough training set. But as most data scientists will testify, having too much data can end up being quite a headache. What should you do when you\u2019re faced with a dataset that has 1000s of variables? It\u2019s not possible to analyze each variable at a granular level.", "That\u2019s where dimensionality reduction techniques play such a vital role. Reducing the number of features without losing (too much) information is something we all strive for. Dimensionality reduction is quite a powerful way of doing this, as Pulkit shows in this comprehensive article. Check out the 12 (yes 12!) techniques he discusses along with their implementation in Python, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis and t-SNE.", "Tableau is such a wonderful tool for analyzing the data at hand. But it\u2019s not just limited to producing beautiful visualizations \u2013 you can perform Excel-like tasks in it as well.

We move beyond the \u2018Show Me\u2019 feature of Tableau and explore advanced graphs here. As Pavleen puts it so eloquently \u2013 \u201cthere is something exciting and enrapturing about the grandeur of these advanced charts\u201d.", "The different charts covered in this article \u2013 Motion, Bump, Donut, Waterfall and Pareto. Additionally, you will be introduced to the concept of R programming in Tableau. This can come in really handy when you\u2019re looking to combine data science with BI!", "I had a lot of fun putting this guide together. Interviews are often the biggest stumbling block aspiring data scientists face, and getting through them requires a combination of certain skills. Cracking these interviews becomes even more challenging if you\u2019re coming from a non-technical background (like me).", "What kind of questions are usually asked? What does the interviewer look for? What\u2019s the right combination of technical and soft skills required? These can be daunting..only if you\u2019re not prepared. And that was the idea behind writing this lengthy and detailed guide.", "This comprehensive post covers multiple topics with plenty of resources, including data science and machine learning questions, tool specific quizzes, a variety of case studies, puzzles, guesstimates, and even a couple of really inspiring stories to point you towards the finishing line!", "Aspiring data scientists make tons of mistakes in their haste to break into the field.
