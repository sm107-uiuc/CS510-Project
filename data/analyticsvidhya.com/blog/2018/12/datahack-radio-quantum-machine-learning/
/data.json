What's the job scene like? How can you learn the subject? Find out in this awesome episode with Dr. Mandaar Pande!"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Quantum computing and quantum machine learning \u2013 most of us have come across these concepts at some point without getting the opportunity to delve deeper. But what if I told you that these could potentially disrupt the way we see and use technology?", "We are joined by Dr. Mandaar Pande in episode #14 of the DataHack Radio podcast, where he navigates us through the wonderfully complex world of quantum computing. Here\u2019s a mind-blowing fact to give you a taste of what to expect:", "\u201cThe number of bits in a 300 qubit quantum computer will be more than the known atoms in the universe.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 Dr. Mandaar Pande", "Before I personally met Dr. Mandaar at DataHack Summit 2018 (where he also spoke on this subject), I only had a vague sense of what quantum computers are and the gigantic amount of power they can process. But as you\u2019ll soon find out, there\u2019s a lot more that goes on behind the scenes that one might never have thought of.", "I have briefly covered the main topics discussed in this episode but the true joy and knowledge lies in listening to Dr. Mandaar himself.", "Subscribe to DataHack Radio today and listen to this, as well as all previous episodes, on any of the below platforms:", "Dr. Mandaar holds a Ph.D degree in theoretical physics from the University of Hyderabad, with a specialization in non-linear optics. After completing his Ph.D in 1994, he took up a post as a lecturer at BITS Pilani for the next four years in the EEE department (electrical engineering).", "Experienced folks will recall that it was in the late \u201990s when IT started picking up steam in India, and Dr. Mandaar decided to take the plunge and explore other avenues outside of academia. He joined Tech Mahindra in 1998 as part of the modeling and simulation centre. There, he worked\u00a0in the capacity of Group Head and Principal Consultant in the area of Performance\u00a0Engineering and Management.", "Following a 12 year stint at Tech Mahindra, he spent 7 years at Wipro \u2013 first as a Lead Architect, then as the Global Practice Head for Performance Engineering \u2013 Quality Engineering and Testing. Dr. Mandaar\u2019s experience in this field, as you can tell, is incredibly rich and not many folks come close to rivalling his experience and know-how.", "But for Dr. Mandaar, it felt inevitable that he would return to academia at some point and he joined Symbiosis as the professor of IT last year.", "So where does his interest and passion for quantum computing and machine learning fit into the picture? Well, towards his final years with Wipro, he got some exposure to the digital way of working (and data science was a big part of that). He built up an interest while working there, and kept that up during his transition back to academia with Symbiosis.", "His Ph.D in quantum optics obviously helped while he pursued quantum computing. But what is this field exactly? And how does it tie into machine learning? Let\u2019s hear that from Dr. Mandaar himself:", "\u201cQuantum Computing is a field that is at the intersection of quantum physics, information science, as well as function theory. And one of the largest applications of quantum computing in the near future is going to be quantum machine learning.\u00a0\u201c", "This is a tough one, and a question I have been wondering about ever since I heard about this subject. Below are the two key points Dr. Mandaar mentioned:", "There\u2019s a lot more to it, but if you don\u2019t possess a solid base in these two aspects, it\u2019s going to be next to impossible to make headway.", "The current version of digital devices we use, like computers and smartphones, use metal chips in them (which are based on integrated circuits that are in turn based on transistors). Whatever computing we do today, including the data we capture and the analysis we perform, is done using the 2 bits we see in these transistors \u2013 0 and 1. Any algorithm that we write eventually gets broken down into 0 and 1 at the machine level.", "At the most fundamental level, the physical principles that govern the nature in quantum computing follow the laws of quantum mechanics. So then what is quantum mechanics? It\u2019s a theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest level (atoms and molecules). At this really basic level, these particles behave very differently.", "Now, there are a couple of things that are very important to understand:", "This is just a taste of what Dr. Mandaar described in the podcast. He broke down this complex topic into easy-to-digest bits of information using examples. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how quantum computers work from the ground up, this section will feel like you\u2019ve hit the jackpot.", "The general perception is that it might take up to 15-20 years before we see quantum computing becoming mainstream and getting democratized.", "But as Dr. Mandaar pointed out, these things are not written in stone. A big breakthrough has the potential to throw the doors wide open and accelerate the timeline (as we have seen with deep learning and AI in recent times). But until that happens, quantum computing will remain the realm of the big organisations like IBM.", "According to Dr. Mandaar, most of the classic machine learning and deep learning algorithms have a quantum equivalent now. He took the example of a perceptron, which is also available as a quantum perceptron. Further, Dr. Mandaar mentioned four ways how one can look at Quantum ML:", "That was a power-packed episode! There was a lot Dr. Mandaar told us about a subject most of us have vaguely heard of in our professional careers. Apart from the points I\u2019ve mentioned here, the conversation also covered topics like challenges in quantum computing, the areas where classical computers could potentially be better than quantum computers, a very specific list of requirements one needs to learn in order to gain traction in this field, what a quantum internet is (really cool concept!), among other things.", "Senior Editor at Analytics Vidhya.\nData visualization practitioner who loves reading and delving deeper into the data science and machine learning arts. Always looking for new ways to improve processes using ML and AI.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
