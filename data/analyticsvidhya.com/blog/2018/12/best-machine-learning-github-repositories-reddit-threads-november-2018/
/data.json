There are often days when I find myself immersed in programming something from scratch. That exhilarating feeling you get when you see your hard work culminate in a successful model? Exhilarating and unparalleled!", "But as a data scientist (or a programmer), its equally important to create checkpoints of your code at various intervals. It\u2019s incredibly helpful to know where you started off from last time so if you have to rollback your code or simply branch out to a different path, there\u2019s always a fallback option. And that\u2019s why GitHub is such an excellent platform.", "The previous posts in this monthly series have expounded on why every data scientist should have an active GitHub account. Whether it\u2019s for collaboration, resume/portfolio, or educational purposes, it\u2019s simply the best place to enhance your coding skills and knowledge.", "And now let\u2019s get to the core of our article \u2013 machine learning code! I have picked out some really interesting repositories which I feel every data scientist should try out on their own.", "Apart from coding, there are tons of aspects associated with being a data scientist. We need to be aware of all the latest developments in the community, what other machine learning professionals and thought leaders are talking about, what are the moral implications of working on a controversial project, etc. That is what I aim to bring out in the Reddit discussion threads I showcase every month.", "To make things easier for you, here\u2019s the entire collection so far of the top GitHub repositories and Reddit discussions (from April onwards) we have covered each month:", "Keeping our run going of including reinforcement learning resources in this series, here\u2019s one of the best so far \u2013 OpenAI\u2019s Spinning Up! This is an educational resource open sourced with the aim of making it easier to learn deep RL. Given how complex it can appear to most folks, this is quite a welcome repository.", "The repo contains a few handy resources:", "This one is for all the audio/speech processing people out there. WaveGlow is a flow-based generative network for speech synthesis. In other words, it\u2019s a network (yes, a single network!) that can generate impressive high quality speech from\u00a0mel-spectrograms.", "This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of WaveGlow and a pre-trained model to get you started. It\u2019s a really cool framework, and you can check out the below links as well if you wish to delve deeper:", "We covered the PyTorch implmentation of BERT in last month\u2019s article, and here\u2019s a different take on it. For those who are new to BERT, it stands for\u00a0Bidirectional\u00a0Encoder\u00a0Representations from\u00a0Transformers. It\u2019s basically a method for pre-training language representations.", "BERT has set the NLP world ablaze with it\u2019s results, and the folks at Google have been kind enough to release quite a few pre-trained models to get you on your way.", "This repository \u201cuses BERT as the sentence encoder and hosts it as a service via ZeroMQ, allowing you to map sentences into fixed-length representations in just two lines of code\u201d. It\u2019s easy to use, extremely quick, and scales smoothly. Try it out!", "Quick, Draw is a popular online game developed by Google where a neural network tries to guess what you\u2019re drawing. The neural network learns from each drawing, hence increasing it\u2019s already impressive ability to correctly guess the doodle. The developers have built up a HUGE dataset from the amount of drawings users have made previously. It\u2019s an open-source dataset which you can check out here.", "And now you can build your own Quick, Draw game in Python with this repository. There is a step-by-step explanation of how to do this. Using this code, you can run an app to either draw in front of the computer\u2019s webcam, or on a canvas.", "GAN Dissection, pioneered by researchers at MIT\u2019s\u00a0Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is a unique way of visualizing and understanding the neurons of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). But it isn\u2019t just limited to that \u2013 the researchers have also created GANPaint\u00a0to showcase how GAN Dissection works.", "This helps you explore what a particular GAN model has learned by inspecting and manipulating it\u2019s internal neurons. Check out the research paper here and the below video demo, and then head straight to the GitHub repository to dive straight into the code!", "Has this question ever crossed your mind while learning basic machine learning concepts? This is one of the fundamental algorithms we come across in our initial learning days and has proven to be quite effective in ML competitions as well. But once you start going through this thread, prepare to seriously question what you\u2019ve studied previously.", "What started off as a straight forward question turned into a full-blown discussion among the top minds on Reddit. I thoroughly enjoyed browsing through the comments and I\u2019m sure anyone with interest in this field (and mathematical rigour) will find it useful.", "What do you do when the developer of a complex and massive neural network vanishes without leaving behind the documentation needed to understand it? This isn\u2019t a fictional plot, but a rather common situation the original poster of the thread found himself in.", "It\u2019s a situation that happens regularly with developers but takes on a whole new level of intrigue when it comes to deep learning. This thread explores the different ways a data scientist can go about examining how a deep neural network model was initially designed. The responses range from practical to absurd, but each adds a layer of perspective which could help you one day if you ever face this predicament.", "My attention to this thread was drawn by the sheer number of comments (110 at the time of writing) \u2013 what in the world could be so controversial about this topic? But when you started scrolling down, the sheer difference in opinions among the debators is mind boggling. Apart from TensorFlow being derided for being \u201cnot the best framework\u201d, there\u2019s a lot of love being shown to PyTorch (which isn\u2019t all that surprising if you\u2019ve used PyTorch).", "It all started when Francois Chollet posted his thoughts on GitHub and lit a (metaphorical) fire under the machine learning community.", "Another OpenAI entry in this post \u2013 and yet another huge breakthrough by them. The title might not leap out of the page as anything special but it\u2019s important to understand what the OpenAI team have conjured up here. As one of the Redditors pointed out, this takes us one step closer to machines mimicking human behavior.", "It took around a year of total experience to beat the Montezuma\u2019s Revenge game at a super human level \u2013 pretty impressive!", "This one is for all the aspiring data scientists reading the article. The author of the thread expounds on how he landed the coveted job, his background, where he studied data science from, etc. After answering these standard questions, he has actually written a very nice post on what others in a similar position can do to further their ambitions.", "There are some helpful comments as well if you scroll down a little bit. And of course, you can post your own question(s) to the author there.", "Quite a collection this month. I found the GAN Dissection repository quite absorbing. I\u2019m currently in the process of trying to replicate it on my own machine \u2013 should be quite the ride. I\u2019m also keeping an eye on the \u2018Reverse Engineering a Massive Neural Network\u2019 thread as the ideas spawning there could be really helpful in case I ever find myself in that situation.", "Which GitHub repository and Reddit thread stood out for you?
