As a data scientist, you need to have an answer to this oft-asked question.", "For example, let\u2019s say you want to build a real-world model to predict the stock price of a company, and you want to build a methodology for it, but you observed that the stock price increased rapidly overnight. There could be multiple reasons behind it. Finding the likelihood estimators or unbiased estimators is the most probable reason is what Maximum Likelihood Estimation is all about. This concept is used in economics, MRIs, and satellite imaging, among other things.", "In this post, we will step by step look into how Maximum Likelihood Estimation (referred to as MLE hereafter) works and how it can be used to determine coefficients or model parameters with any distribution. Understanding MLE would involve knowledge of probability value (p-value), but I will try to make it easier with examples.", "Note: As mentioned, this article assumes that you know the basics of maths and probability.

The data has the following histogram and density.", "How would you model such a variable (var)? The variable is not normally distributed and is asymmetric hence it violates the assumptions of linear regression. A popular way is to transform the variable with log, sqrt, reciprocal, etc. so that the transformed variable is normally distributed and can be modeled with linear regression.", "Let\u2019s try these transformations and see how the results are:", "With Log Transformation:With Square Root Transformation:With Reciprocal: ", "None of these is close to a normal distribution. How should we model such data so that the basic assumptions of the model are not violated? How about modeling this data with a different distribution rather than a normal one? If we do use a different distribution, how will we estimate the coefficients?", "This is where Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) has such a major advantage.", "While studying stats and probability, you must have come across problems like \u2013 What is the probability of x > 100, given that x follows a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation (sd) 10, or what does degree of freedom means? In such problems, we already know the distribution (normal in this case) and its parameters (mean and sd), but in real-life problems, these quantities are unknown and must be estimated from the data. MLE is the technique that helps us determine the parameters of the distribution that best describe the given data or confidence intervals.", "Let\u2019s understand this with an example: Suppose we have data points representing the weight (in kgs) of students in a class. The data points are shown in the figure below (the R code that was used to generate the image is provided as well):", "This appears to follow a normal distribution. But how do we get the mean and standard deviation (sd) for this distribution? One way is to directly compute the mean and sd of the given data, which comes out to be 49.8 Kg and 11.37, respectively. These values are a good representation of the given data but may not best describe the population.", "We can use MLE in order to get more robust parameter estimates. Thus, MLE can be defined as a method for estimating population parameters (such as the mean and variance for Normal, rate (lambda) for Poisson, etc.) from sample data such that the probability (likelihood) of obtaining the observed data is maximized.", "In order to get an intuition of MLE, try to guess which of the following would maximize the probability of observing the data in the above figure.", "Clearly, numerically it is not very likely we\u2019ll observe the above data shape if the population mean is 100.", "Now that you got an intuition of what MLE can do, we can get into the details of what the actual likelihood method is and how it can be maximized. But first, let\u2019s start with a quick review of distribution parameters.", "Let us first understand distribution parameters. Wikipedia\u2019s definition of this term is as follows: \u201cIt is a quantity that indexes a family of probability distributions\u201d. It can be regarded as a numerical characteristic of a population or a statistical model. We can understand it by the following diagram:", "The width and height of the bell curve are conditional and are governed by two parameters \u2013 mean and variance. These are known as distribution parameters for normal distribution. Similarly, Poisson distribution is governed by one parameter \u2013 lambda, which is the\u00a0number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space.", "Most of the distributions have one or two parameters, but some distributions can have up to 4 parameters, like a 4 parameter beta distribution.", "From Fig. 2 and 3, we can see that given a set of distribution parameters, some data values are more probable than other data. From Fig. 1, we have seen that the given data is more likely to occur when the\u00a0mean is 50 rather than\u00a0100. In reality, however, we have already observed the data. Accordingly, we are faced with an inverse problem: Given the observed data and a model of interest, we need to find the one Probability Density Function/Probability Mass Function (f(x|\u03b8)), among all the probability densities that are most likely to have produced the data.", "To solve this inverse problem, we define the likelihood function by reversing the roles of the data vector x and the (distribution) parameter vector \u03b8 in f(x| \u03b8),\u00a0i.e.,", "In MLE, we can assume that we have a likelihood function L(\u03b8;x), where \u03b8\u00a0is the distribution parameter vector, and x is the set of observations. We are interested in finding the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the likelihood with given observations (values of x).", "The mathematical problem at hand becomes simpler if we assume that the observations (xi) are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a Probability Distribution, f0 (where f0\u00a0= Normal Distribution, for example, in Fig.1). This reduces the Likelihood function to:", "To find the maxima/minima of this function, we can take the derivative of this function w.r.t \u03b8\u00a0and equate it to 0 (as zero slopes indicate maxima or minima). Since we have terms in product here, we need to apply the chain rule, which is quite cumbersome with products. A clever trick would be to take the log of the likelihood function and maximize the same. This will convert the product to a sum, and since the log is a strictly increasing function, it would not impact the resulting value of \u03b8. So we have:", "To find the maxima of the log-likelihood function LL(\u03b8; x), we can:", "In many situations, calculus is of no direct help in maximizing a likelihood, but a maximum can still be readily identified. There\u2019s nothing that gives setting the first derivative equal to zero any kind of \u2018primacy\u2019 or special place in finding the parameter value(s) that maximize log-likelihood. It\u2019s a convenient tool when a few parameters must be estimated.", "As a general principle, pretty much any valid approach for identifying the argmax of a function may be suitable to find the maxima of the log-likelihood function. This is an unconstrained non-linear optimization problem. We seek an optimization algorithm that behaves in the following manner:", "It\u2019s very common to use optimization techniques to maximize likelihood; there are a large variety of methods (Newton\u2019s method, Fisher scoring, various conjugate gradient-based approaches, steepest descent, Nelder-Mead type (simplex) approaches, BFGS, and a wide variety of other techniques).", "It turns out that when the model is assumed to be Gaussian, as in the examples above, the MLE estimates are equivalent to the ordinary least squares method.", "You can refer to the proof here.", "Let us now look at how MLE can be used to determine the coefficients of a predictive model.", "Suppose that we have a large sample size (asymptotic normality)of n observations y1, y2, . . . , yn which can be treated as realizations of independent Poisson random variables, with Yi \u223c P(\u00b5i). Also, suppose that we want to let the mean \u00b5i (and therefore the variance!) depend on a vector of explanatory variables xi. We could form a simple linear model as follows:", "where \u03b8 is the vector of model coefficients. This model has the disadvantage that the linear predictor on the right-hand side can assume any real value, whereas the Poisson mean on the left-hand side, which represents an expected count, has to be non-negative. A straightforward solution to this problem is to model the logarithm of the mean using a linear model. Thus, we consider a generalized linear model with log link log, which can be written as follows:", "Our aim is to find \u03b8 by using MLE. Now, Poisson distribution is given by:We can apply the log-likelihood concept that we learned in the previous section to find the \u03b8.
