You want to become a data scientist. But where to begin? There are far too many resources out there. How do you decide the starting point? Did you miss out on topics you should have studied? Which are the best resources to learn?", "Don\u2019t worry, we have you covered!", "Analytics Vidhya\u2019s learning path for 2016 saw 250,000+ views. In 2017, we went even further and saw an incredible 500,000+ views! So this year, we have made the learning path more interactive than ever before and we can\u2019t wait for you to experience it yourself.", "This year, the learning path has been designed on a completely new LMS portal. This portal allows you to track your progress as your data science journey continues. We have designed questions and exercises after each module to test your understanding. You will also be able to access the related hackathons / practice problems from the same place.", "We even have a discussion portal within the learning path where you can share your doubts and queries and even post the awesome projects you\u2019re working on!", "Take a sneak peek below of how the progress tracking looks like:", "Just a few things to note before you experience our new LMS portal:", "Below is a summary of the learning path \u2013 an overview what you should follow throughout the year. Let\u2019s get cracking", "By the end of January, you\u2019ll know what role data science plays in the industry. You\u2019ll also be able to answer the burning question \u2013 why use Python and how is it useful?", "Before this month is over, you should have a firm grasp over the basics of statistics. You should also be proficient at exploring the dataset given to you and know the role data visualization plays in this. The budding data scientist is slowly coming out!", "Time to get into machine learning!", "By the end of the month, you should have a firm command on the basic machine learning topics like linear and logistic regression, among others. To test what you\u2019ve learnt so far, we will provide you with two projects to apply your newly acquired data science skills!", "Continue learning the ML basics and by the end of April, you should know enough to take part in hackathons are secure a decent rank. Also, go in depth into feature engineering \u2013 one of the MOST important things in data science.", "Building models is not enough. The real test of a data scientist comes in explaining the power of the model you\u2019ve created to non-technical people. By the end of May, you should have structured your thinking and personality as a data scientist to be able to do this.", "This is a very critical month in your progress. Attempt to get a high ranking in hackathons and competitions all the while learning how to make an impactful presentation of your work. Also, start looking for an internship; you should have enough knowledge by now to secure one.", "Deep dive into advanced machine learning. With half the year behind you, you should be ready to tackle advanced ML algorithms and time series models.", "Unfortunately, most real-world data comes in an unstructured format. This month you should get a deeper understanding of how to deal with unstructured data in business scenarios including learning the Natural Language Processing field. At the end of the month, you will be given a few projects to apply your newly learned skills.", "Here comes one of the hottest data science subjects around \u2013 Deep Learning! By the end of August, you should be able to deal with basic neural network problems. As usual, we will provide you with a couple of projects to test your mettle.", "Practice is the name of the data science game. Keep checking your progress by taking part in competitions.", "By the end of October, you should also be familiar with topics like recommendation methods, and reinforced learning. This is also when you should start taking up a language like SQL to interact with databases (a truly important skill for a data scientist).", "If you have seriously followed this plan, you should be able to deal with interview questions. Continue to acquire new skills, delve into Big Data and make sure you stick to your plan!", "A few pointers to make this learning path (and 2018) super successful for you:", "2018 \u2013 here we come!
