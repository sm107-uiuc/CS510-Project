It\u2019s simply not possible to wait around for people to skill up; technology is advancing too quickly for companies to sit on their laurels and hope that people catch up.", "Keeping this in mind, Google has developed and made this platform available to businesses. It hopes to bridge the gap between the current AI capabilities and the vast potential this field has to offer. Google believes this will provide opportunities for less-skilled engineers to build powerful AI systems and make AI experts even more productive and efficient.", "It\u2019s first product launch, as part of the Cloud AutoML portfolio, is Cloud AutoML Vision. This service will make it simpler to train image recognition models.\u00a0It has a drag-and-drop interface that let\u2019s the user upload images, train the model, and then deploy those models directly on Google Cloud.", "Cloud AutoML Vision is built on Google\u2019s transfer learning and neural architecture search\u00a0technologies\u00a0(among others). Disney has already started using the technology to annotate their products to improve the customer\u2019s experience on their shopDisney site. The Zoological Society of London is also using AutoML Vision to recognise and track wildlife in order to understand their disturibtion and how humans are impacting the species.", "You can watch Google\u2019s Cloud AutoML introduction here:", "You can sign up for it here.", "There are already automated machine learning tools out there, but Google\u2019s newest addition is sure to create waves. The entire Cloud AutoML platform will help businesses scale up their AI capabilities without requiring advanced machine learning expertise. It opens the door for non-technical people to understand and utilise machine learning to improve not only their portfolio, but their company\u2019s as well. Google has promise more products under the Cloud AutoML umbrella so those who don\u2019t like coding can enjoy this latest renaissance in the ML and AI fields.", "Senior Editor at Analytics Vidhya.\nData visualization practitioner who loves reading and delving deeper into the data science and machine learning arts.
