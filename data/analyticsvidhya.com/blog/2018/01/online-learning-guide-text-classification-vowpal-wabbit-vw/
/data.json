Google predicts real time click-through rates for their ads. This is used as an input to their auction mechanism, apart from a bid from the advertiser to decide which ads to show to the user.", "Stackoverflow uses real time predictions to automatically tag a question with the correct programming language so that they reach the right asker. An election management team might want to predict real time sentiment using Twitter to assess the impact of their campaign.", "Such datasets are also characterized by their large size. For training the model, we can always take a sub-sample of the data, but its a rather unreliable method. There\u2019s a good chance we might miss out on a significant amount of information.", "Is there a solution that tackles both these problems? As it turns out, there is. In this article, we will discuss a comparison of batch learning and online learning. In the second section, we\u2019ll look at an example of text classification using an online learning framework called Vowpal Wabbit (VW).", "Let\u2019s say we want to build a model that identifies spam emails. One way is to download a large corpus of emails, train a model on it and subsequently test it on unseen examples. This is called offline learning. Another way is to take in each email sequentially and continuously update the parameters in a classifier. You guessed it \u2013 this is online learning.", "Going back to our example of spam classification, imagine a situation where the spammers have found a work-around and started bypassing the existing spam classifier. Two teams have been tasked to solve the problem \u2013 The Batch Learning Team and the Online Learning team.", "SkLearn has SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor from sklearn.linear_model. These are nice implementations of SGD/online learning but we\u2019ll focus on Vowpal Wabbit as it\u2019s superior to sklearn\u2019s SGD models in many aspects, including computational performance. The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) project is a fast online learning framework sponsored by Microsoft Research and (previously) Yahoo! Research.", "When it comes to categorical variables, label encoding or one hot encoding are popular methods of dealing with it. These are good, if we are able to store and process the whole dataset. But online learning does not have the liberty of looking at the complete dataset. Also, real data can be volatile and we cannot guarantee that new values of categorical features will not be added at some point. This issue hampers the use of the trained model when some new data is introduced,", "This is where Vowpal Wabbit comes into the picture.", "The idea is very simple: convert data into a vector of features. When this is done using hashing, we call the method \u201cfeature hashing\u201d or \u201cthe hashing trick\u201d.", "I\u2019ll explain how it works with a simple example using text as data.", "We would like to represent this as a vector. The first thing we need to do is fix the length of the vector, i.e., the number of dimensions we are going to use. For the purpose of this example, we will take 5 dimensions.", "Once we fix the number of dimensions, we will need a hash function that will take a string and return a number between 0 and n-1 (in our case between 0 and 4). Any good hash function can be used. We will use h(string) mod n to make it return a number between 0 and n-1. h(string) generates a large number based on the number of bits allotted.", "I\u2019ll compute the results for each word in our text:", "Once we have this, we can simply construct our vector as:", "Notice that we just add 1 to the nth dimension of the vector each time our hash function returns that dimension for a word in the text.", "Vowpal Wabbit is so incredibly fast in part due to the hashing trick. With many features and a small-sized hash, collisions (i.e. when we have the same hash for 2 different features) start occurring. These collisions may influence the results. Often for the worse, but not necessarily: Multiple features sharing the same hash can have a PCA-like effect of dimensionality reduction.", "If you feel hashing is really hurting the performance of your model, you could increase the number of bits required to produce the hash. Read more about hash functions here.", "It\u2019s friendly to online learning where you can train on a dataset that doesn\u2019t fit in memory because you need to see each example only once. One-hot encoding/Label Encoding will not work with online learning because to prepare dictionaries you need to see whole dataset first.", "Vowpal Wabbit reads data from files or from standard input stream (stdin) assuming the following format:", "Namespace=String[:Value]\nFeatures=(String[:Value] )*\nhere [] denotes non-mandatory elements, and (\u2026)* means some repeats.\n\nLabel is a number. In case of classification it is usually 1 and -1, in case of regression it is some real float value\nImportance is a number, it denotes sample weight during training. Setting this helps when working with imbalanced data\nTag is some string without spaces \u2013 it is a \u201cname\u201d of sample, VW saves it upon prediction. In order to separate Tag and Importance it is better to start Tag with the \u2018 character\nNamespace is for creation of separate feature spaces\nFeatures are object features inside Namespace. Features have weight 1.0 by default, but it can be changed, for example \u2013 feature:0.1\n\n\u00a0\nVW for text classification\nConsider a setting where a movie production company wants to build a real time IMDB review extraction and prediction system. This is a binary classification problem and the task is to predict whether a particular review is positive or negative. The data provided has only the actual reviews as text. Here, I will show you how easy it is to work with text data using Vowpal Wabbit.\nInstalling Vowpal Wabbit is easy and can be done using the documentation provided at this link.\nVW can only be used via command line syntax. Help related to all the functions can be seen using the following command:\n!vw --help\r\n\nThe review dataset is provided in the form of text files at the provided link. The following piece of python code helps to read all the text files and combine it into a single file.\nimport os\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport re\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_files\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score\r\n\r\n# Read the train Data\r\npath_to_movies = os.path.expanduser('/home/analyticsvidhya/IMDB/')\r\nreviews_train = load_files(os.path.join(path_to_movies, 'train'))\r\ntext_train, y_train = reviews_train.data, reviews_train.target\nNext, we will convert the text to the Vowpal Wabbit format described above.\nHere, it is difficult to put the words (features) in different namespaces and hence we will just consider all the words separately without considering the interaction features.\nWe have done a very basic removal of all the words with less than three characters (like \u2018is\u2019, \u2018in\u2019 etc.) because these do not add any valuable information to the model.\ndef to_vw_format(document, label=None):\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return str(label or '') + ' |text ' + ' '.join(re.findall('\\w{3,}', document.lower())) + '\\n'\r\nto_vw_format(str(text_train[1]), 1 if y_train[0] == 1 else -1)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Splitting train data to train and validation sets\r\ntrain_size = int(0.7 * len(text_train))\r\ntrain, train_labels = text_train[:train_size], y_train[:train_share]\r\nvalid, valid_labels = text_train[train_size:], y_train[train_share:]\r\n\r\n# Convert and save in vowpal wabbit format\r\nwith open('movie_reviews_train.vw', 'w') as vw_train_data:\r\n   for text, target in zip(train, train_labels):\r\n   vw_train_data.write(to_vw_format(str(text), 1 if target == 1 else -1))\r\nwith open('movie_reviews_valid.vw', 'w') as vw_train_data:\r\n   for text, target in zip(valid, valid_labels):\r\n   vw_train_data.write(to_vw_format(str(text), 1 if target == 1 else -1))\nVW can be used at the terminal or command line. If you prefer using the python notebook, you can use \u2018!\u2019 before the command to run it like any other python code.\n\u00a0\nTraining\n# Fitting a logistic regression for predicting the sentiment of a review\r\n!vw -d movie_reviews_train.vw --loss_function logistic -f movie_reviews_model.vw\r\n\nNow, let\u2019s examine each of the syntax elements in the above command line function.\n\n-d This is used to include the\u00a0 path to train the data for the command line.\n\u2013loss_function This is used to declare the loss function (e.g. squared, logistic, hinge etc.).\n-f\u00a0 This is used to save the model for using it on a different dataset.\n\n\n\u00a0\nTesting\n!vw -i movie_reviews_model.vw -t -d movie_reviews_valid.vw -p movie_valid_pred.txt --quiet\n\n-i Read the model from the given file\n-t -d\u00a0Declare that we are dealing with dataset without labels (test) at this path\n-p Save predictions to this file\n\u2013quiet Do not print any steps taken for prediction\n\nwith open('movie_valid_pred.txt') as pred_file:\r\n     valid_prediction = [float(label) for label in pred_file.readlines()]\r\n     print(\"Accuracy: {}\".format(round(accuracy_score(valid_labels, [int(pred_prob > 0) for pred_prob in valid_prediction]), 5)))\r\n     print(\"AUC: {}\".format(round(roc_auc_score(valid_labels, valid_prediction), 5)))\r\n\r\n\nThat is quite an impressive accuracy for such a simple model and it only gets better as we stream more data to VW.\nWe have built a decent model by just feeding it the actual words and a label. And we did this in a fraction of a second on an average system! Now, let\u2019s try hinge loss as the loss function to check if we can improve the results.\n\nHinge loss did not show any significant improvement. Let\u2019s move on to adding more features via n-grams.\n\u00a0\nn-grams\nVW also supports other functionalities specifically for text data.\nFor those new to the Natural Language Processing landscape, n-grams are a continuous sequence of n words inside a text. For example, in the sentence:\n\u201cHi, I don\u2019t like dark places\u201d\n\u2018don\u2019t like\u2019 and \u2018dark places\u2019 are examples of bi-grams (n =2).\n\nLet us briefly discuss how n-grams can provide a boost to accuracy. We\u2019ll take the phrase \u2013 \u2018not the best experience\u2019. This phrase has a definite negative sentiment, but if we don\u2019t use n-grams, a positive weight will be learnt owing to the presence of the word \u2018best\u2019. However, if we include bi-grams, \u2018not best\u2019 will be a separate feature and will have a more negative weight which is appropriate in this case.\nVW supports n-grams via command line tags. Let us try including bi-grams in our model to see whether they improve the overall accuracy.\n!vw -d movie_reviews_train.vw --loss_function logistic --ngram 2 -f movie_reviews_model_bigram.vw --quiet\n\nIndeed, we get a better accuracy and a higher AUC after including the bi-grams in the model. We can also try including tri-grams or higher to see if we can get a further boost in the accuracy.\n\u00a0\nModel Interpretability\nHow do we interpret the model we just created? VW has a one line solution for it. We just need to replace -f\u00a0 with\u00a0\u2013invert_hash and it will produce a model file that is human readable.\n!vw -d movie_reviews_train.vw --loss_function logistic --ngram 2 --invert_hash movie_reviews_readable_model_bigram.vw\n\nWe can see the weights learnt for various bi-grams in the above screenshot. \u2018abominably, being a strictly negative word, produces mostly negative weights except in a few cases where the other word is highly positive, like \u2018best\u2019.\n\u00a0\nRegularization\nL1 and L2 regularization may be added with the \u2013l1 and \u2013l2 options respectively.\n!vw -d movie_reviews_train.vw --l1 0.00005 --l2 0.00005 --loss_function logistic --ngram 2 -f movie_reviews_model_bigram.vw\n\u00a0\nEnd Notes\nText data is not the only domain where online learning is useful. It performs really well for CTR (Click-through Rate) predictions and supports many different optimization methods. I plan to cover these in a future article.\nMeanwhile, please let me know in the comments if you have ever used VW or online learning to solve a problem.
