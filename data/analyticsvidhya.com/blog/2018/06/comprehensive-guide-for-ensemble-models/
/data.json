It\u2019s highly unlikely.", "You would likely browser a few web portals where people have posted their reviews and compare different car models, checking for their features and prices. You will also probably ask your friends and colleagues for their opinion. In short, you wouldn\u2019t directly reach a conclusion, but will instead make a decision considering the opinions of other people as well.", "Ensemble models in machine learning operate on a similar idea. They combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This can be achieved in various ways, which you will discover in this article.", "The objective of this article is to introduce the concept of ensemble learning and understand the algorithms which use this technique. To cement your understanding of this diverse topic, we will explain the advanced algorithms in Python using a hands-on case study on a real-life problem.", "Note:\u00a0This article assumes a basic understanding of Machine Learning algorithms. I would recommend going through this article\u00a0to familiarize yourself with these concepts. You can also learn about ensemble learning chapter-wise by enrolling in this free course:", "Are you a beginner looking for a place to start your journey in data science and machine learning? Presenting two comprehensive courses, full of knowledge and data science learning, curated just for you!", "Ensemble learning refers to a machine learning approach in which the predictions from multiple models are merged to enhance the accuracy and resilience of the ultimate forecast. The underlying concept behind ensemble learning is to mitigate the errors or biases that may exist in individual models by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple models, which ultimately leads to a more precise prediction.", "Let\u2019s understand the concept of ensemble learning with an example. Suppose you are a movie director and you have created a short movie on a very important and interesting topic. Now, you want to take preliminary feedback (ratings) on the movie before making it public. What are the possible ways by which you can do that?", "A: You may ask one of your friends to rate the movie for you.Now it\u2019s entirely possible that the person you have chosen loves you very much and doesn\u2019t want to break your heart by providing a 1-star rating to the horrible work you have created.", "B: Another way could be by asking 5 colleagues of yours to rate the movie.This should provide a better idea of the movie. This method may provide honest ratings for your movie. But a problem still exists. These 5 people may not be \u201cSubject Matter Experts\u201d on the topic of your movie. Sure, they might understand the cinematography, the shots, or the audio, but at the same time may not be the best judges of dark humour.", "C: How about asking 50 people to rate the movie?Some of which can be your friends, some of them can be your colleagues and some may even be total strangers.", "The responses, in this case, would be more generalized and diversified since now you have people with different sets of skills. And as it turns out \u2013 this is a better approach to get honest ratings than the previous cases we saw.", "With these examples, you can infer that a diverse group of people are likely to make better decisions as compared to individuals. Similar is true for a diverse set of models in comparison to single models. This diversification in Machine Learning is achieved by a technique called Ensemble Learning.", "Now that you have got a gist of what ensemble learning is \u2013 let us look at the various techniques in ensemble learning along with their implementations.", "In this section, we will look at a few simple but powerful techniques, namely:", "The max voting method is generally used for classification problems. In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a \u2018vote\u2019. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.", "For example, when you asked 5 of your colleagues to rate your movie (out of 5); we\u2019ll assume three of them rated it as 4 while two of them gave it a 5. Since the majority gave a rating of 4, the final rating will be taken as 4. You can consider this as taking the mode of all the predictions.", "The result of max voting would be something like this:", "Here x_train consists of independent variables in training data, y_train is the target variable for training data. The validation set is x_test (independent variables) and y_test (target variable) .Python Code:", "Alternatively, you can use \u201cVotingClassifier\u201d module in sklearn as follows:", "Similar to the max voting technique, multiple predictions are made for each data point in averaging. In this method, we take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction. Averaging can be used for making predictions in regression problems or while calculating probabilities for classification problems.", "For example, in the below case, the averaging method would take the average of all the values.", "This is an extension of the averaging method. All models are assigned different weights defining the importance of each model for prediction. For instance, if two of your colleagues are critics, while others have no prior experience in this field, then the answers by these two friends are given more importance as compared to the other people.", "Now that we have covered the basic ensemble techniques, let\u2019s move on to understanding the advanced techniques.", "Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that uses predictions from multiple models (for example decision tree, knn or svm) to build a new model. This model is used for making predictions on the test set. Below is a step-wise explanation for a simple stacked ensemble:", "We first define a function to make predictions on n-folds of train and test dataset. This function returns the predictions for train and test for each model.", "Now we\u2019ll create two base models \u2013 decision tree and knn.", "Create a third model, logistic regression, on the predictions of the decision tree and knn models.", "In order to simplify the above explanation, the stacking model we have created has only two levels. The decision tree and knn models are built at level zero, while a logistic regression model is built at level one. Feel free to create multiple levels in a stacking model.", "Blending follows the same approach as stacking but uses only a holdout (validation) set from the train set to make predictions. In other words, unlike stacking, the predictions are made on the holdout set only. The holdout set and the predictions are used to build a model which is run on the test set. Here is a detailed explanation of the blending process:", "We\u2019ll build two models, decision tree and knn, on the train set in order to make predictions on the validation set.", "Combining the meta-features and the validation set, a logistic regression model is built to make predictions on the test set.", "The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Here\u2019s a question: If you create all the models on the same set of data and combine it, will it be useful? There is a high chance that these models will give the same result since they are getting the same input. So how can we solve this problem? One of the techniques is bootstrapping.", "Bootstrapping is a sampling technique in which we create subsets of observations from the original dataset, with replacement. The size of the subsets is the same as the size of the original set.", "Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses these subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set). The size of subsets created for bagging may be less than the original set.", "Before we go further, here\u2019s another question for you: If a data point is incorrectly predicted by the first model, and then the next (probably all models), will combining the predictions provide better results? Such situations are taken care of by boosting.", "Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. Let\u2019s understand the way boosting works in the below steps.", "Bagging and Boosting are two of the most commonly used techniques in machine learning. In this section, we will look at them in detail. Following are the algorithms we will be focusing on:", "For all the algorithms discussed in this section, we will follow this procedure:", "For this article, I have used the Loan Prediction Problem. You can download the dataset from here. Please note that a few code lines (reading the data, splitting into train-test sets, etc.)\u00a0 will be the same for each algorithm. In order to avoid repetition, I have written the code for the same below, and further discussed only the code for the algorithm.", "Similarly, fill values for all the columns. EDA, missing values and outlier treatment has been skipped for the purposes of this article. To understand these topics, you can go through this article: Ultimate guide for Data Exploration in Python using NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.", "Let\u2019s jump into the bagging and boosting algorithms!", "Bagging meta-estimator is an ensembling algorithm that can be used for both classification (BaggingClassifier) and regression (BaggingRegressor) problems. It follows the typical bagging technique to make predictions. Following are the steps for the bagging meta-estimator algorithm:", "Random Forest is another ensemble machine learning algorithm that follows the bagging technique.\u00a0It is an extension of the bagging estimator algorithm. The base estimators in random forest are decision trees. Unlike bagging meta estimator, random forest randomly selects a set of features which are used to decide the best split at each node of the decision tree.", "Looking at it step-by-step, this is what a random forest model does:", "Note: The decision trees in random forest can be built on a subset of data and features. Particularly, the sklearn model of random forest uses all features for decision tree and a subset of features are randomly selected for splitting at each node.", "To sum up, Random forest randomly selects data points and features, and builds multiple trees (Forest) . Code:", "Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is one of the simplest boosting algorithms. Usually, decision trees are used for modelling. Multiple sequential models are created, each correcting the errors from the last model. AdaBoost assigns weights to the observations which are incorrectly predicted and the subsequent model works to predict these values correctly.", "Below are the steps for performing the AdaBoost algorithm:", "Gradient Boosting or GBM is another ensemble machine learning algorithm that works for both regression and classification problems. GBM uses the boosting technique, combining a number of weak learners to form a strong learner. Regression trees used as a base learner, each subsequent tree in series is built on the errors calculated by the previous tree.", "We will use a simple example to understand the GBM algorithm. We have to predict the age of a group of people using the below data:", "XGBoost (extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. XGBoost has proved to be a highly effective ML algorithm, extensively used in machine learning competitions and hackathons. XGBoost has high predictive power and is almost 10 times faster than the other gradient boosting techniques. It also includes a variety of regularization which reduces overfitting and improves overall performance. Hence it is also known as\u00a0\u2018regularized boosting\u2018 technique.", "Let us see how XGBoost is comparatively better than other techniques:", "Since XGBoost takes care of the missing values itself, you do not have to impute the missing values. You can skip the step for missing value imputation from the code mentioned above. Follow the remaining steps as always and then apply xgboost as below.", "Before discussing how Light GBM works, let\u2019s first understand why we need this algorithm when we have so many others (like the ones we have seen above). Light GBM beats all the other algorithms when the dataset is extremely large. Compared to the other algorithms, Light GBM takes lesser time to run on a huge dataset.", "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based algorithms and follows leaf-wise approach while other algorithms work in a level-wise approach pattern. The images below will help you understand the difference in a better way.", "Leaf-wise growth may cause over-fitting on smaller datasets but that can be avoided by using the \u2018max_depth\u2019 parameter for learning. You can read more about Light GBM and its comparison with XGB in this article.", "Handling categorical variables is a tedious process, especially when you have a large number of such variables. When your categorical variables have too many labels (i.e. they are highly cardinal), performing one-hot-encoding on them exponentially increases the dimensionality and it becomes really difficult to work with the dataset.", "CatBoost can automatically deal with categorical variables and does not require extensive data preprocessing like other machine learning algorithms. Here is an article that explains CatBoost in detail.", "CatBoost algorithm effectively deals with categorical variables. Thus, you should not perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables. Just load the files, impute missing values, and you\u2019re good to go.", "This brings us to the end of the ensemble algorithms section. We have covered quite a lot in this article!", "Ensemble modeling can exponentially boost the performance of your model and can sometimes be the deciding factor between first place and second! In this article, we covered various ensemble learning techniques and saw how these techniques are applied in machine learning algorithms. Further, we implemented the algorithms on our loan prediction dataset.", "This article will have given you a solid understanding of this topic. If you have any suggestions or questions, do share in the comment section below. Also, I encourage you to implement these algorithms at your end and share your results with us!", "And if you want to hone your skills as a data science professional then I will recommend you take up this comprehensive course that provides you all the tools and techniques you need to apply machine learning to solve business problems.", "Applied Machine Learning \u2013 Beginner to Professional", "A. Bagging and boosting are ensemble learning techniques in machine learning. Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets of training data with replacement and combines their predictions to reduce variance and improve generalization. Boosting combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner by focusing on misclassified data points and assigning higher weights in the next iteration. Examples of bagging algorithms include Random Forest while boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Both techniques are widely used and can significantly improve model performance.", "A. Bagging reduces variance by training multiple models independently on different subsets of training data and combining their predictions, while boosting reduces bias by iteratively training weak learners and focusing on misclassified data points to create a strong learner.
