If you are working in this field, it\u2019s extremely important to keep yourself updated with what\u2019s new.", "Following GitHub repositories is one such way to do so. You can see the latest developments, interesting projects and their applications. I can not tell how much learning can happen through this.", "You can download the code and run it on your own machine or simply just keep it as a reference point for your project. Whatever the application, GitHub communities are invaluable resources.", "In this post, we look at 5 GitHub repositories created in January 2018 that you must follow. This is part of a series from Analytics Vidhya that will run every month.", "Detectron is a software system developed by Facebook\u2019s AI Research team (FAIR) that \u201cimplements state-of the art object detection algorithms\u201d. It is written in Python and leverages the Caffee2 deep learning framework underneath.", "Along with the Python code, FAIR has also released performance baselines for over 70 pre-trained models. Once the model(s) is trained, it can be deployed on the cloud and even on mobile devices.", "Detectron has been covered by us here.", "This is a replica of the AlphaZero methodology developed in Python. The author has written the code to train an algorithm to play the Connect4 game. It\u2019s not quite as complex as the famed \u2018Go\u2019 game, but there are 4,531,985,219,092 possible game positions so it\u2019s perfect for this situation.", "The main advantages of this repository are two-fold, namely:", "Run it and you will see the beauty in AlphaGo!", "Caire\u00a0is a content-aware image resizing library. Currently, most applications either give you the option of cropping an image or changing it\u2019s aspect ratio. This often leads to either the main parts being left out or the image becoming blurred. This is where Caire comes into play.", "It has support for both shrinking and enlarging any image, resizing it horizontally or vertically and does not require any third party library. It uses edge detection to generate an energy map of the image. Based on that, it finds seams in the image and uses it\u2019s algorithm accordingly. The process of how this works has been illustrated in the three images below:", "It is based on the\u00a0Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing\u00a0paper.

It\u2019s the first open-source systems that has achieved 70+ mAP on the COCO dataset 80+ mAP on the MPII dataset. Additionally, the authors have also developed \u2018Pose Flow\u2019, which is an online pose tracker.", "And here are two bonus repositories for you!", "VisualDL is a tool that can visualize the entire deep learning process for us. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful visualization tool that helps us design deep learning jobs. VisualDL was built to support Python. Just by adding a few lines of Python code and inserting them into our neural network model, we can generate plenty of visualizations to understand the framework. VisualDL has also been written in low level C++.", "Currently, VisualDL provides four components (more will be added soon):", "You can read more about these components, and how VisualDL works, in our post here.", "There are a ton of things to do when starting a TensorFlow project. The underlying idea behind this repository is to wrap up thonse things into a simple and well-defined structure.
