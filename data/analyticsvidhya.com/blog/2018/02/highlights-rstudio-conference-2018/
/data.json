Most of the slides and materials presented have now been shared by the facilitators. While the focus was understandably on deep learning, quite a few other interesting packages were shared during the event.", "The conference was held over a two day span and we have highlighted the most exciting things from each day in this article", "The first day of the conference had a heavy focus on the tidyverse world. The keynote speaker was Diane Cook on the topic \u201cTo the tidyverse and beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science\u201c. The takeaway from her talk was that tidy data provides the glue from raw data to the data in the statistics textbooks and it will continue to help in various fields in the future.", "Davis Vaughan presented on \u201cThe future of time series and financial analysis in the tidyverse\u201d where he revealed a couple of packages which, as the name suggests, make it far easier to deal with messy time series and financial data. Keeping the theme of finance going, Emily Riederer has created a package called \u201ctidycf\u201d which makes dealing with cash flow analysis a whole lot simpler and interpretable.", "Emily Robinson shined some light on \u201cThe lesser known stars of the tidyverse\u201c. The presentation looks at some of the ways of tidying your data using not-so-well known tidyverse functions. You can view her presentation slides here.", "A few of the other talks on day 1 included:", "You can watch the entire day\u2019s video below:", "The second day had a heavy dose of deep learning in R. The keynote on this day was \u2018Machine Learning with TensorFlow and R\u2018 presented by JJ Allaire. He kicked things off with a tour of the basic of tensors and introduced the tensorflow package in R.\u00a0Mr. Allaire wrapped up his talk by demoing various ways of deploying tensorflow and keras models, including publishing them directly to RStudio Connect.", "This was followed by Google\u2019s Michael Quinn. His talk was on \u201cLarge scale machine learning using TensorFlow, BigQuery and CloudML Engine within RStudio\u201c. Once you\u2019ve developed a tensorflow or keras model, you can then deploy this to Google\u2019s CloudML. This can be accomplished using the \u2018cloudml\u2018 package.", "Keeping the theme of deep learning going, Javier Luraschi (from RStudio) gave a talk on \u201cDeploying TensorFlow models with tfdeploy\u201c. The \u2018tfdeploy\u2019 package provides a unified way of deploying models directly to various platforms including CloudML and RStudio Connect.", "One of the more intriguing talks of the conference was by Ali Zaidi on \u201cReinforcement learning in Minecraft with CNTK-R\u201c. Mr. Zaidi demonstrated how he trained a deep-learning model to control a character in the popular video game Minecraft. The character was taught how to navigate a puzzling maze as well as understand a few tidbits of natural language. The package used for training the model was \u201cCNTK-R\u201c.", "Some of the other fascinating talks included:", "Watch the entire day\u2019s video here.", "All the material that was presented at the conference can be found on Github here. It will be updated with the recordings of each session as well once available.", "Deep learning was the general theme running throughout day 2. It has made significant strides in the world of machine learning and given it\u2019s increasing influence, it came as no surprise that plenty of packages are being created for this purpose. R has a plethora of supporting packages for TensorFlow which is quite encouraging for people using this language.", "Apart from that, the \u2018tidyverse\u2019 world got a lot of love from the presenters and new ways of tidying up messy data were shown. For R users, this conference is something you should absolutely check out using the links above.", "Senior Editor at Analytics Vidhya.\nData visualization practitioner who loves reading and delving deeper into the data science and machine learning arts.
