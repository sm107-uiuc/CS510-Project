We can\u2019t be sure but we can surely generate an approximate value based on the previous prices. Time series modeling is one way to predict them.", "Besides Cryptocurrencies, there are multiple important areas where time series forecasting is used \u2013 forecasting Sales, Call Volume in a Call Center, Solar activity, Ocean tides, Stock market behaviour, and many others.", "Assume the Manager of a hotel wants to predict how many visitors should he expect next year to accordingly adjust the hotel\u2019s inventories and make a reasonable guess of the hotel\u2019s revenue.

In the Moving average method as seen above, we equally weigh the past \u2018n\u2019 observations.

Ins", "After we have understood the above methods, we can note that both Simple average and Weighted moving average lie on completely opposite ends. We would need something between these two extremes approaches which takes into account all the data while weighing the data points differently. For example it may be sensible to attach larger weights to more recent observations than to observations from the distant past. The technique which works on this principle is called Simple exponential smoothing. Forecasts are calculated using weighted averages where the weights decrease exponentially as observations come from further in the past, the smallest weights are associated with the oldest observations:", "where\u00a00\u2264 \u03b1 \u22641\u00a0is the smoothing parameter.", "The one-step-ahead forecast for time\u00a0T+1\u00a0is a weighted average of all the observations in the series\u00a0y1,\u2026,yT.

And this is why this method is called Exponential. The forecast at time\u00a0t+1\u00a0is equal to a weighted average between the most recent observation\u00a0yt\u00a0and the most recent forecast\u00a0y\u0302\u00a0t|t\u22121.", "We will now calculate RMSE to check to accuracy of our model.", "We can see that implementing Simple exponential model with alpha as 0.6 generates a better model till now.

In this case we can see that there is an increasing trend.", "Although each one of these methods can be applied to the trend as well.\u00a0 E.g. the Naive method would assume that trend between last two points is going to stay the same, or we could average all slopes between all points to get an average trend, use a moving trend average or apply exponential smoothing.", "But we need a method that can map the trend accurately without any assumptions. Such a method that takes into account the trend of the dataset is called Holt\u2019s Linear Trend method.", "Each Time series dataset can be decomposed into it\u2019s componenets which are Trend, Seasonality and Residual. Any dataset that follows a trend can use Holt\u2019s linear trend method for forecasting.", "We can see from the graphs obtained that this dataset follows an increasing trend. Hence we can use Holt\u2019s linear trend to forecast the future prices.", "Holt extended simple exponential smoothing to allow forecasting of data with a trend. It is nothing more than exponential smoothing applied to both level(the average value in the series) and trend. To express this in mathematical notation we now need three equations: one for level, one for the trend and one to combine the level and trend to get the expected forecast y\u0302", "The values we predicted in the above algorithms are called Level. In the above three equations, you can notice that we have added level and trend to generate the forecast equation.", "As with simple exponential smoothing, the level equation here shows that it\u00a0is a weighted average of observation\u00a0and the within-sample one-step-ahead forecast\u00a0The trend equation shows that it\u00a0is a weighted average of the estimated trend at time\u00a0t\u00a0based on \u2113(t)\u2212\u2113(t\u22121)\u00a0and\u00a0b(t\u22121), the previous estimate of the trend.", "We will add these equations to generate Forecast equation. We can also generate a multiplicative forecast equation by multiplying trend and level instead of adding it. When the trend increases or decreases linearly, additive equation is used whereas when the trend increases of decreases exponentially, multiplicative equation is used.Practice shows that multiplicative is a more stable predictor, the additive method however is simpler to understand.", "We will now calculate RMSE to check to accuracy of our model.", "We can see that this method maps the trend accurately and hence provides a better solution when compared with above models. We can still tune the parameters to get even a better model.", "So let\u2019s introduce a new term which will be used in this algorithm. Consider a hotel located on a hill station. It experiences high visits during the summer season whereas the visitors during the rest of the year are comparatively very less. Hence the profit earned by the owner will be far better in summer season than in any other season. This pattern will repeat itself every year. Such a repetition is called Seasonality. Datasets which show a similar set of pattern after fixed intervals of a time period suffer from seasonality.", "The above mentioned models don\u2019t take into account the seasonality of the dataset while forecasting. Hence we need a method that takes into account both trend and seasonality to forecast future prices. One such algorithm that we can use in such a scenario is Holt\u2019s Winter method. The idea behind triple exponential smoothing(Holt\u2019s Winter) is to apply exponential smoothing to the seasonal components in addition to level and trend.", "Using Holt\u2019s winter method will be the best option among the rest of the models beacuse of the seasonality factor. The Holt-Winters seasonal method comprises the forecast equation and three smoothing equations \u2014 one for the level\u00a0\u2113t, one for trend\u00a0bt and one for the seasonal component denoted by\u00a0st, with smoothing parameters\u00a0\u03b1,\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0and\u00a0\u03b3.", "The level equation shows a weighted average between the seasonally adjusted observation\u00a0and the non-seasonal forecast\u00a0for time\u00a0t. The trend equation is identical to Holt\u2019s linear method. The seasonal equation shows a weighted average between the current seasonal index, and the seasonal index of the same season last year (i.e., s\u00a0time periods ago).", "In this method also, we can implement both additive and multiplicative technique. \u00a0The additive method is preferred when the seasonal variations are roughly constant through the series, while the multiplicative method is preferred when the seasonal variations are changing proportional to the level of the series.", "We will now calculate RMSE to check to accuracy of our model.", "We can see from the graph that mapping correct trend and seasonality provides a far better solution. We chose seasonal_period = 7 as data repeats itself weekly. Other parameters can be tuned as per the dataset. I have used default parameters while building this model. You can tune the parameters to achieve a better model.", "Another common Time series model that is very popular among the Data scientists is ARIMA. It stand for Autoregressive Integrated Moving average.\u00a0While exponential smoothing models were based on a description of trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the correlations in the data with each other. An improvement over ARIMA is Seasonal ARIMA. It takes into account the seasonality of dataset just like Holt\u2019 Winter method.\u00a0You can study more about ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA models and it\u2019s pre-processing from these articles (1) and (2).", "We will now calculate RMSE to check to accuracy of our model.", "We can see that using Seasonal ARIMA generates a similar solution as of Holt\u2019s Winter. We chose the parameters as per the ACF and PACF graphs. You can learn more about them from the links provided above. If you face any difficulty finding the parameters of ARIMA model, you can use auto.arima\u00a0implemented in R language. A substitute of auto.arima in Python can be viewed here.", "We can compare these models on the basis of their RMSE scores.", "Now, its time to take the plunge and actually play with some other real datasets. So are you ready to take on the challenge? Test the techniques discussed in this post and accelerate your learning in Time Series Analysis with the following Practice Problem:", "I hope this article was helpful and now you\u2019d be comfortable in solving similar Time series problems. I suggest you take different kinds of problem statements and take your time to solve them using the above-mentioned techniques. Try these models and find which model works best on which kind of Time series data.", "One lesson to learn from these steps is that each of these models can outperform others on a particular dataset. Therefore it doesn\u2019t mean that one model which performs best on one type of dataset will perform the same for all others too.", "You can also explore forecast package built for Time series modelling in R language.\u00a0You may also explore Double seasonality models from forecast package.
