This includes features like quarterly sales, month-on-month expenditure, and a whole host of things that come with Apple\u2019s balance sheet. As a data scientist, which kind of problem would you classify this as? Time series modeling, of course.", "From predicting the sales of a product to estimating the electricity usage of households, time series forecasting is one of the core skills any data scientist is expected to know, if not master. There are a plethora of different techniques out there which you can use, and we will be covering one of the most effective ones, called Auto ARIMA, in this article.", "We will first understand the concept of ARIMA which will lead us to our main topic \u2013 Auto ARIMA. To solidify our concepts, we will take up a dataset and implement it in both Python and R.", "If you are familiar with time series and it\u2019s techniques (like moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA), \u00a0you can skip directly to section 4. For beginners, start from the below section which is a brief introduction to time series and various forecasting techniques.", "Before we learn about the techniques to work on time series data, we must first understand what a time series actually is and how is it different from any other kind of data. Here is the formal definition of time series \u2013 It is a series of data points measured at consistent time intervals. This simply means that particular values are recorded at a constant interval which may be hourly, daily, weekly, every 10 days, and so on. What makes time series different is that each data point in the series is dependent on the previous data points. Let us understand the difference more clearly by taking a couple of examples.", "Suppose you have a dataset of people who have taken a loan from a particular company (as shown in the table below). Do you think each row will be related to the previous rows? Certainly not! The loan taken by a person will be based on his financial conditions and needs (there could be other factors such as the family size etc., but for simplicity we are considering only income and loan type) . Also, the data was not collected at any specific time interval. It depends on when the company received a request for the loan.", "Let\u2019s take another example. Suppose you have a dataset that contains the level of CO2 in the air per day (screenshot below). Will you be able to predict the approximate amount of CO2 for the next day by looking at the values from the past few days? Well, of course. If you observe, the data has been recorded on a daily basis, that is, the time interval is constant (24 hours).", "You must have got an intuition about this by now \u2013 the first case is a simple regression problem and the second is a time series problem. Although the time series puzzle here can also be solved using linear regression, but that isn\u2019t really the best approach as it neglects the relation of the values with all the relative past values. Let\u2019s now look at some of the common techniques used for solving time series problems.", "There are a number of methods for time series forecasting and we will briefly cover them in this section. The detailed explanation and python codes for all the below mentioned techniques can be found in this article: 7 techniques for time series forecasting (with python codes).", "In this section we will do a quick introduction to ARIMA which will be helpful in understanding Auto Arima. A detailed explanation of Arima, parameters (p,q,d), plots (ACF PACF) and implementation is included in this article : Complete tutorial to Time Series.", "ARIMA is a very popular statistical method for time series forecasting. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages. ARIMA models work on the following assumptions \u2013", "ARIMA has three components \u2013 AR (autoregressive term), I (differencing term) and MA (moving average term). Let us understand each of these components \u2013", "The general steps to implement an ARIMA model are \u2013", "Although ARIMA is a very powerful model for forecasting time series data, the data preparation and parameter tuning processes end up being really time consuming. Before implementing ARIMA, you need to make the series stationary, and determine the values of p and q using the plots we discussed above. Auto ARIMA makes this task really simple for us as it eliminates steps 3 to 6 we saw in the previous section. Below are the steps you should follow for implementing auto ARIMA:", "We completely bypassed the selection of p and q feature as you can see. What a relief! In the next section, we will implement auto ARIMA using a toy dataset.", "We will be using the International-Air-Passenger dataset. This dataset contains monthly total of number of passengers (in thousands). It has two columns \u2013 month and count of passengers. You can download the dataset from this link.\nPython Code:", "Below is the R Code for the same problem:", "In the above code, we simply used the .fit() command to fit the model without having to select the combination of p, q, d. But how did the model figure out the best combination of these parameters? Auto ARIMA takes into account the AIC and BIC values generated (as you can see in the code) to determine the best combination of parameters. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) values are estimators to compare models. The lower these values, the better is the model.", "Check out these links if you are interested in the maths behind AIC and BIC.", "I have found auto ARIMA to be the simplest technique for performing time series forecasting. Knowing a shortcut is good but being familiar with the math behind it is also important. In this article I have skimmed through the details of how ARIMA works but do make sure that you go through the links provided in the article. For your easy reference, here are the links again:", "I would suggest practicing what we have learned here on this practice problem: Time Series Practice Problem. You can also take our training course created on the same practice problem,\u00a0Time series forecasting, to provide you a head start.", "Good luck, and feel free to provide your feedback and ask questions in the comments section below.", "An avid reader and blogger who loves exploring the endless world of data science and artificial intelligence.
