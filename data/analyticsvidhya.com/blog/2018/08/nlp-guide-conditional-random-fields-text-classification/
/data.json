Google processes more than 40,000 searches EVERY second!\u00a0 According to a Forbes report, every single minute we send 16 million text messages and post 510,00 comments on Facebook. For a layman, it is difficult to even grasp the sheer magnitude of data out there?", "News sites and other online media alone generate tons of text content on an hourly basis. Analyzing patterns in that data can become daunting if you don\u2019t have the right tools. Here we will discuss one such approach, using entity recognition, called Conditional Random Fields (CRF).", "This article explains the concept and python implementation of conditional random fields on a self-annotated dataset. This is a really fun concept and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy taking this ride with me!", "Entity recognition has seen a recent surge in adoption with the interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). An entity can generally be defined as a part of text that is of interest to the data scientist or the business. Examples of frequently extracted entities are names of people, address, account numbers, locations etc. These are only simple examples and one could come up with one\u2019s own entity for the problem at hand.", "To take a simple application of entity recognition, if there\u2019s any text with \u201cLondon\u201d in the dataset, the algorithm would automatically categorize or classify that as a location (you must be getting a general idea of where I\u2019m going with this).", "Let\u2019s take a simple case study to understand our topic in a better way.", "Suppose that you are part of an analytics team in an insurance company where each day, the claims team receives thousands of emails from customers regarding their claims. The claims operations team goes through each email and updates an online form with the details before acting on them.", "You are asked to work with the IT team to automate the process of pre-populating the online form. For this task, the analytics team needs to build a custom entity recognition algorithm.", "To identify entities in text, one must be able to identify the pattern. For example, if we need to identify the claim number, we can look at the words around it such as \u201cmy id is\u201d or \u201cmy number is\u201d, etc. Let us examine a few approaches mentioned below for identifying the patterns.", "The bag of words (BoW) approach works well for multiple text classification problems. This approach assumes that presence or absence of word(s) matter more than the sequence of the words. However, there are problems such as entity recognition, part of speech identification where word sequences matter as much, if not more. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) comes to the rescue here as it uses word sequences as opposed to just words.", " Let us now understand how CRF is formulated.", "Below is the formula for CRF where Y is the hidden state (for example, part of speech) and X is the observed variable (in our example this is the entity or other words around it). ", "Broadly speaking, there are 2 components to the CRF formula:", " Now that you are aware of the CRF model, let us curate the training data. The first step to doing this is annotation.\u00a0 Annotation is a process of tagging the word(s) with the corresponding tag. For simplicity, let us suppose that we only need 2 entities to populate the online form, namely the claimant name and the claim number.", "The following is a sample email received as is. Such emails need to be annotated so that the CRF model can be trained. The annotated text needs to be in an XML format. Although you may choose to annotate the documents in your way, I\u2019ll walk you through the use of the GATE architecture to do the same. ", "I am writing this email to claim my insurance amount. My id is abc123 and I claimed it on 1st January 2018. I did not receive any acknowledgement. Please help. ", "\u201c<document>Hi, I am writing this email to claim my insurance amount. My id is <claim_number>abc123</claim_number> and I claimed on 1st January 2018. I did not receive any acknowledgement. Please help. Thanks, <claimant>randomperson</claimant></document>\u201d", "Let us understand how to use the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE). Please follow the below steps to install GATE.", "Once the installation is complete, you are ready to train and build your own CRF module. Let\u201ds do this!", "Let\u2019s define and build a few functions.", "Now we will import the annotated training data.", "Generate features. These are the default features that NER algorithm uses in nltk. One can modify it for customization.", "Now we\u2019ll build features and create train and test data frames.", "You can inspect any predicted value by selecting the corresponding row number \u201ci\u201d.", "Check the performance of the model.", "Print out the classification report. Based on the model performance, build better features to improve the performance.", "By now, you would have understood how to annotate training data, how to use Python to train a CRF model, and finally how to identify entities from new text. Although this algorithm provides some basic set of features, you can come up with your own set of features to improve the accuracy of the model.", "To summarize, here are the key points that we have covered in this article:", "Sidharth Macherla \u2013 Independent Researcher, Natural Language Processing", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
