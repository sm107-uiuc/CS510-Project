It is often the difference between getting into the top 10 of the leaderboard and finishing outside the top 50!", "I have been a huge advocate of feature engineering ever since I realized it\u2019s immense potential. But it can be a slow and arduous process when done manually. I have to spend time brainstorming over what features to come up, and analyze their usability them from different angles. Now, this entire FE process can be automated and I\u2019m going to show you how in this article.", "We will be using the Python feature engineering library called Featuretools to do this. But before we get into that, we will first look at the basic building blocks of FE, understand them with intuitive examples, and then finally dive into the awesome world of automated feature engineering using the BigMart Sales dataset.", "In the context of machine learning, a feature can be described as a characteristic, or a set of characteristics, that explains the occurrence of a phenomenon. When these characteristics are converted into some measurable form, they are called features.", "For example, assume you have a list of students. This list contains the name of each student, number of hours they studied, their IQ, and their total marks in the previous examinations. Now you are given information about a new student\u2014 the number of hours he/she studied and his IQ, but his/her marks are missing. You have to estimate his/her probable marks.", "Here, you\u2019d use IQ and study_hours to build a predictive model to estimate these missing marks. So, IQ and study_hours are called the features for this model.", "Feature Engineering can simply be defined as the process of creating new features from the existing features in a dataset. Let\u2019s consider a sample data that has details about a few items, such as their weight and price.", "Now, to create a new feature we can use Item_Weight and Item_Price. So, let\u2019s create a feature called Price_per_Weight. It is nothing but the price of the item divided by the weight of the item. This process is called feature engineering.", "This was just a simple example to create a new feature from existing ones, but in practice, when we have quite a lot of features, feature engineering can become quite complex and cumbersome.", "Let\u2019s take another example. In the popular Titanic dataset, there is a passenger name feature and below are some of the names in the dataset:", "These names can actually be broken down\u00a0into additional meaningful features. For example, we can extract and group similar titles into single categories. Let\u2019s have a look at the unique number of titles in the passenger names.", "It turns out that titles like\u00a0\u2018Dona\u2019, \u2018Lady\u2019, \u2018the Countess\u2019, \u2018Capt\u2019, \u2018Col\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019, \u2018Dr\u2019, \u2018Major\u2019, \u2018Rev\u2019, \u2018Sir\u2019, and \u2018Jonkheer\u2019 are quite rare and can be put under a single label. Let\u2019s call it rare_title. Apart from this, the titles \u2018Mlle\u2019 and \u2018Ms\u2019 can be placed under \u2018Miss\u2019, and \u2018Mme\u2019 can be replaced with \u2018Mrs\u2019.", "Hence, the new title feature would have only 5 unique values as shown below:", "So, this is how we can extract useful information with the help of feature engineering, even from features like passenger names which initially seemed fairly pointless.", "The performance of a predictive model is heavily dependent on the quality of the features in the dataset used to train that model. If you are able to create new features which help in providing more information to the model about the target variable, it\u2019s performance will go up. Hence, when we don\u2019t have enough quality features in our dataset, we have to lean on feature engineering.", "In one of the most popular Kaggle competitions, Bike Sharing Demand Prediction, the participants are asked to forecast the rental demand in Washington, D.C based on historical usage patterns in relation with weather, time and other data.", "As explained in this article, smart feature engineering was instrumental in securing a place in the top 5 percentile of the leaderboard. Some of the features created are given below:", "Creating such features is no cakewalk \u2013 it takes a great deal of brainstorming and extensive data exploration. Not everyone is good at feature engineering because it is not something that you can learn by reading books or watching videos. This is why feature engineering is also called an art. If you are good at it, then you have a major edge over the competition. Quite like Roger Federer, the master of feature engineering when it comes to Tennis shots.", "Analyze the two images shown above. The left one shows a car being assembled by a group of men during early 20th century, and the right picture shows robots doing the same job in today\u2019s world. Automating any process has the potential to make it much more efficient and cost-effective. For similar reasons, feature engineering can, and has been, automated in machine learning.", "Building machine learning models can often be a painstaking and tedious process. It involves many steps so if we are able to automate a certain percentage of feature engineering tasks, then the data scientists or the domain experts can focus on other aspects of the model. Sounds too good to be true, right?", "Now that we have understood that automating feature engineering is the need of the hour, the next question to ask is \u2013 how is it going to happen? Well, we have a great tool to address this issue and it\u2019s called Featuretools.", "Featuretools is an open source library for performing automated feature engineering. It is a great tool designed to fast-forward the feature generation process, thereby giving more time to focus on other aspects of machine learning model building. In other words, it makes your data \u201cmachine learning ready\u201d.", "Before taking Featuretools for a spin, there are three major components of the package that we should be aware of:", "a) An Entity\u00a0can be considered as a representation of a Pandas DataFrame. A collection of multiple entities is called an Entityset.", "b) Deep Feature Synthesis\u00a0(DFS) has got nothing to do with deep learning. Don\u2019t worry. DFS is actually a Feature Engineering method and is the backbone of Featuretools. It enables the creation of new features from single, as well as multiple dataframes.", "c) DFS create features by applying Feature primitives to the Entity-relationships in an EntitySet. These primitives are the often-used methods to generate features manually. For example, the primitive \u201cmean\u201d would find the mean of a variable at an aggregated level.", "The best way to understand and become comfortable with Featuretools is by applying it on a dataset. So, we will use the dataset from our BigMart Sales practice problem\u00a0in the next section to solidify our concepts.", "The objective of the BigMart Sales challenge is to build a predictive model to estimate the sales of each product at a particular store. This would help the decision makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales. Note that there are 1559 products across 10 stores in the given dataset.", "The below table shows the features provided in our data:", "You can download the data from here.", "Featuretools is available for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6. You can easily install Featuretools using pip.", "To start off, we\u2019ll just store the target Item_Outlet_Sales in a variable called sales and id variables in test_Item_Identifier and\u00a0test_Outlet_Identifier.", "Then we will combine the train and test set as it saves us the trouble of performing the same step(s) twice.", "Let\u2019s check the missing values in the dataset.", "Quite a lot of missing values in the Item_Weight and Outlet_size variables. Let\u2019s quickly deal with them:", "I will not do an extensive preprocessing operation since the objective of this article is to get you started with Featuretools.", "It seems Item_Fat_Content contains only two categories, i.e., \u201cLow Fat\u201d and \u201cRegular\u201d \u2013 the rest of them we will consider redundant. So, let\u2019s convert it into a binary variable.", "Now we can start using Featuretools to perform automated feature engineering! It is necessary to have a unique identifier feature in the dataset (our dataset doesn\u2019t have any right now). So, we will create one unique ID for our combined dataset. If you notice, we have two IDs in our data\u2014one for the item and another for the outlet. So, simply concatenating both will give us a unique ID.", "Please note that I have dropped the feature Item_Identifier as it is no longer required. However, I have retained the feature\u00a0Outlet_Identifier because I plan to use it later.", "Now before proceeding, we will have to create an EntitySet. An EntitySet is a structure that contains multiple dataframes and relationships between them. So, let\u2019s create an EntitySet and add the dataframe combination to it.", "Our data contains information at two levels\u2014item level and outlet level. Featuretools offers a functionality to split a dataset into multiple tables. We have created a new table \u2018outlet\u2019 from the BigMart table based on the outlet ID Outlet_Identifier.", "Let\u2019s check the summary of our EntitySet.", "As you can see above, it contains two entities \u2013 bigmart and outlet. There is also a relationship formed between the two tables, connected by Outlet_Identifier. This relationship will play a key role in the generation of new features.", "Now we will use Deep Feature Synthesis to create new features automatically. Recall that DFS uses Feature Primitives to create features using multiple tables present in the EntitySet.", "target_entity is nothing but the entity ID for which we wish to create new features (in this case, it is the entity \u2018bigmart\u2019). The parameter max_depth\u00a0controls the complexity of the features being generated by stacking the primitives. The parameter n_jobs helps in parallel feature computation by using multiple cores.", "That\u2019s all you have to do with Featuretools. It has generated a bunch of new features on its own.", "Let\u2019s have a look at these newly created features.", "DFS has created 29 new features in such a quick time. It is phenomenal as it would have taken much longer to do it manually. If you have datasets with multiple interrelated tables, Featuretools would still work. In that case, you wouldn\u2019t have to normalize a table as multiple tables will already be available.", "Let\u2019s print the first few rows of feature_matrix.", "There is one issue with this dataframe \u2013 it\u00a0is not sorted properly. We will have to sort it based on the id variable from the combi dataframe.", "Now the dataframe feature_matrix is in proper order.", "It is time to check how useful these generated features actually are. We will use them to build a model and predict Item_Outlet_Sales. Since our final data (feature_matrix) has many categorical features, I decided to use the CatBoost algorithm. It can use categorical features directly and is scalable in nature. You can refer to this article to read more about CatBoost.", "CatBoost requires all the categorical variables to be in the string format. So, we will convert the categorical variables in our data to string first:", "Let\u2019s split feature_matrix back into train and test sets.", "Split the train data into training and validation set to check the model\u2019s performance locally.", "Finally, we can now train our model. The evaluation metric we will use is RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).", "The same model got a score of 1155.12 on the public leaderboard. Without any feature engineering, the scores were ~1103 and ~1183 on the validation set and the public leaderboard, respectively. Hence, the features created by Featuretools\u00a0are not just random features, they are valuable and useful. Most importantly, the amount of time it saves in feature engineering is incredible.", "Making our data science solutions interpretable is a very important aspect of performing machine learning. Features generated by Featuretools can be easily explained even to a non-technical person because they are based on the primitives, which are easy to understand.", "For example, the features\u00a0outlet.SUM(bigmart.Item_Weight)\u00a0and outlet.STD(bigmart.Item_MRP)\u00a0mean outlet-level sum of weight of the items and standard deviation of the cost of the items, respectively.", "This makes it possible for those people who are not machine learning experts, to contribute as well in terms of their domain expertise.", "The featuretools package is truly a game-changer in machine learning. While it\u2019s applications are understandably still limited in industry use cases, it has quickly become ultra popular in hackathons and ML competitions. The amount of time it saves, and the usefulness of feature it generates, has truly won me over.", "Try it out next time you work on any dataset and let me know how it went in the comments section!", "Data Scientist at Analytics Vidhya with multidisciplinary academic background.
