You cannot accurately predict any of these results without the \u2018time\u2019 component. And as more and more data is generated in the world around us, time series forecasting keeps becoming an ever more critical technique for a data scientist to master.", "But time series is a complex topic with multiple facets at play simultaneously.", "For starters, making the time series stationary is critical if we want the forecasting model to work well. Why? Because most of the data you collect will have non-stationary trends. And if the spikes are erratic how can you be sure the model will work properly?", "The focus of this article is on the methods for checking stationarity in time series data. This article assumes that the reader is familiar with time series, ARIMA, and the concept of stationarity. Below are some references to brush up on the basics:", "\u2018Stationarity\u2019 is one of the most important concepts you will come across when working with time series data. A stationary series is one in which the properties \u2013 mean, variance and covariance, do not vary with time.", "Let us understand this using an intuitive example. Consider the three plots shown below:", "The three examples shown above represent non-stationary time series. Now look at a fourth plot:", "In this case, the mean, variance and covariance are constant with time. This is what a stationary time series looks like.", "Think about this for a second \u2013 predicting future values using which of the above plots would be easier? The fourth plot, right? Most statistical models require the series to be stationary to make effective and precise predictions.", "So to summarize, a stationary time series is the one for which the properties (namely mean, variance and covariance) do not depend on time. In the next section we will cover various methods to check if the given series is stationary or not.", "In this and the next few sections, I will be introducing methods to check the stationarity of time series data and the techniques required to deal with any non-stationary series. I have also provided the python code for applying each technique.\u00a0You can download the dataset we\u2019ll be using from this link: AirPassengers.", "Before we go ahead and analyze our dataset, let\u2019s load and preprocess\u00a0the data first.", "Looks like we are good to go!", "The next step is to determine whether a given series is stationary or not and deal with it accordingly. This section looks at some common methods which we can use to perform this check.", "Consider the plots we used in the previous section. We were able to identify the series in which mean and variance were changing with time, simply by looking at each plot. Similarly, we can plot the data and determine if the properties of the series are changing with time or not.", "Although its very clear that we have a trend (varying mean) in the above series, this visual approach might not always give accurate results. It is better to confirm the observations using some statistical tests.", "Instead of going for the visual test, we can use statistical tests like the unit root stationary tests. Unit root indicates that the statistical properties of a given series are not constant with time, which is the condition for stationary time series. Here is the mathematics explanation of the same :", "Suppose we have a time series :", "where yt is the value at the time instant t and \u03b5 t is the error term. In order to calculate yt we need the value of yt-1, which is :", "If we do that for all observations, the value of yt will come out to be:", "If the value of a is 1 (unit) in the above equation, then the predictions will be equal to the yt-n and sum of all errors from t-n to t, which means that the variance will increase with time. This is knows as unit root in a time series. We know that for a stationary time series, the variance must not be a function of time. The unit root tests check the presence of unit root in the series by checking if value of a=1. Below are the two of the most commonly used unit root stationary tests:", "The Dickey Fuller test is one of the most popular statistical tests. It can be used to determine the presence of unit root in the series, and hence help us understand if the series is stationary or not. The null and alternate hypothesis of this test are:", "Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (value of a =1)", "Alternate Hypothesis: The series has no unit root.", "If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we can say that the series is non-stationary. This means that the series can be linear or difference stationary (we will understand more about difference stationary in the next section).", "Results of ADF test: The ADF tests gives the following results \u2013 test statistic, p value and the critical value at 1%, 5% , and 10% confidence intervals. The results of our test for this particular series are:\n", "Test for stationarity: If the test statistic is less than the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis (aka the series is stationary). When the test statistic is greater than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (which means the series is not stationary).", "In our above example, the test statistic > critical value, which implies that the series is not stationary. This confirms our original observation which we initially saw in the visual test.", "KPSS is another test for checking the stationarity of a time series (slightly less popular than the Dickey Fuller test). The null and alternate hypothesis for the KPSS test are opposite that of the ADF test, which often creates confusion.", "The authors of the KPSS test have defined the null hypothesis as the process is trend stationary, to an alternate hypothesis of a unit root series. We will understand the trend stationarity in detail in the next section. For now, let\u2019s focus on the implementation and see the results of the KPSS test.", "Null Hypothesis: The process is trend stationary.", "Alternate Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (series is not stationary).", "Results of KPSS test: Following are the results of the KPSS test \u2013 Test statistic, p-value, and the critical value at 1%, 2.5%, \u00a05%, and 10% confidence intervals.

If the test statistic is less than the critical value, if fail to reject the null hypothesis (series is stationary). For the air passenger data, the value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value at all confidence intervals, and hence we can say that the series is not stationary.", "I usually perform both the statistical tests before I prepare a model for my time series data. It once happened that both the tests showed contradictory results. One of the tests showed that the series is stationary while the other showed that the series is not! I got stuck at this part for hours, trying to figure out how is this possible. As it turns out, there are more than one type of stationarity.", "So in summary, the ADF test has an alternate hypothesis of linear or difference stationary, while the KPSS test identifies trend-stationarity in a series.", "Let us understand the different types of stationarities and how to interpret the results of the above tests.", "It\u2019s always better to apply both the tests, so that we are sure that the series is truly stationary. Let us look at the possible outcomes of applying these stationary tests.", "Now that we are familiar with the concept of stationarity and its different types, we can finally move on to actually making our series stationary. Always keep in mind that in order to use time series forecasting models, it is necessary to convert any non-stationary series to a stationary series first.", "In this method, we compute the difference of consecutive terms in the series. Differencing is typically performed to get rid of the varying mean. Mathematically, differencing can be written as:", "where yt is the value at a time t", "Applying differencing on our series and plotting the results:", "In seasonal differencing, instead of calculating the difference between consecutive values, we calculate the difference between an observation and a previous observation from the same season. For example, an observation taken on a Monday will be subtracted from an observation taken on the previous Monday. Mathematically it can be written as:", "Transformations are used to stabilize the non-constant variance of a series. Common transformation methods include power transform, square root, and log transform. Let\u2019s do a quick log transform and differencing on our air passenger dataset:", "As you can see, this plot is a significant improvement over the previous plots. You can use square root or power transformation on the series and see if they come up with better results. Feel free to share your findings in the comments section below!", "In this article we covered different methods that can be used to check the stationarity of a time series.
