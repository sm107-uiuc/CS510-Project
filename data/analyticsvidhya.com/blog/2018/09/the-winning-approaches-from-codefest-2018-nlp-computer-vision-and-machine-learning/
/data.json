And what better way than to put your skills to the test against the top data scientists from around the globe?", "Participating in these hackathons also helps you understand where you need to improve and what else you can learn to get a better score in the next competition. And a very popular demand after each hackathon is to see how the winning solution was designed and the thought process behind it. There\u2019s a lot to learn from this, including how you can develop your own unique framework for future hackathons.", "We are all about listening to our community, so we decided to curate the winning approaches from our recently concluded hackathon series, codeFest!

You can view the details of each competition below:", "It\u2019s time to check out the winners\u2019 approaches!", "The participants were given a list of tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers, laptops, etc. The challenge was to find the tweets which showed a negative sentiment towards such companies or products.", "The metric used for evaluating the performance of the classification model was weighted F1-Score.", "Abhinav and Abhishek have summarized their approach in a very intuitive manner, explaining everything from preprocessing and feature engineering to model building.", "They\u00a0hypertuned each of the above classifiers and found that LSTM (with attention mechanism) produced the best result.", "The Vista hackathon had a pretty intriguing problem statement. The participants had to build a model that counted the number of people in a given group selfie/photo. The dataset provided had already been split, wherein the training set consisted of images with coordinates of the bounding boxes and headcount for each image.", "The evaluation metric for this competition was RMSE (root mean squared error) over the headcounts predicted for test images.", "Check out Deepak\u2019s approach in his own words below:", "Both stages are connected to the backbone structure.", "As a part of enigma competition, the target was to predict the number of upvotes on a question based on other information provided. For every question \u2013 its tag, number of views received, number of answers, username and reputation of the question author, was provided. Using this information, the participant had to predict the upvote count that the question will receive.", "The evaluation metric for this competition was RMSE (root mean squared error).
