DP is a collection of algorithms that\u00a0 can solve a problem where we have the perfect model of the environment (i.e. probability distributions of any change happening in the problem setup are known) and where an agent can only take discrete actions.", "DP essentially solves a planning problem rather than a more general RL problem. The main difference, as mentioned, is that for an RL problem the environment can be very complex and its specifics are not known at all initially.", "But before we dive into all that, let\u2019s understand why you should learn dynamic programming in the first place using an intuitive example.", "Apart from being a good starting point for grasping reinforcement learning, dynamic programming can help find optimal solutions to planning problems faced in the industry, with an important assumption that the specifics of the environment are known.\u00a0DP presents a good starting point to understand RL algorithms that can solve more complex problems.", "Sunny manages a motorbike rental company in Ladakh.

If he is out of bikes at one location, then he loses business.", "The problem that Sunny is trying to solve is to find out how many bikes he should move each day from 1 location to another so that he can maximise his earnings.", "Here, we exactly know the environment (g(n) & h(n)) and this is the kind of problem in which dynamic programming can come in handy.\u00a0Similarly, if you can properly model the environment of your problem where you can take discrete actions, then DP can help you find the optimal solution.\u00a0In this article, we will use DP to train an agent using Python to traverse a simple environment, while touching upon key concepts in RL such as policy, reward, value function and more.", "Most of you must have played the tic-tac-toe game in your childhood. If not, you can grasp the rules of this simple game from its wiki page. Suppose tic-tac-toe is your favourite game, but you have nobody to play it with. So you decide to design a bot that can play this game with you. Some key questions are:", "Can you define a rule-based framework to design an efficient bot?", "You sure can, but you will have to hardcode a lot of rules for each of the possible situations that might arise in a game. However, an even more interesting question to answer is:", "Can you train the bot to learn by playing against you several times? And that too without being explicitly programmed to play tic-tac-toe efficiently?", "A few considerations for this are:", "For more clarity on the aforementioned reward, let us consider a match between bots O and X:", "Consider the following situation encountered in tic-tac-toe:", "If bot X puts X in the bottom right position for example, it results in the following situation:", "Bot O would be rejoicing (Yes! They are programmed to show emotions) as it can win the match with just one move. Now, we need to teach X not to do this again. So we give a negative reward or punishment to reinforce the correct behaviour in the next trial. We say that this action in the given state would correspond to a negative reward and should not be considered as an optimal action in this situation.", "Similarly, a positive reward would be conferred to X if it stops O from winning in the next move:", "Now that we understand the basic terminology, let\u2019s talk about formalising this whole process using a concept called a Markov Decision Process or MDP.", "A Markov Decision Process (MDP) model contains:", "Now, let us understand the markov or \u2018memoryless\u2019 property.", "Any random process in which the probability of being in a given state depends only on the previous state, is a markov process.", "In other words, in the markov decision process setup, the environment\u2019s response at time t+1 depends only on the state and action representations at time t, and is independent of whatever happened in the past.", "The above diagram clearly illustrates the iteration at each time step wherein the agent receives a reward Rt+1 and ends up in state St+1\u00a0based on its action At at a particular state St. The overall goal for the agent is to maximise the cumulative reward it receives in the long run. Total reward at any time instant t is given by:", "where T is the final time step of the episode. In the above equation, we see that all future rewards have equal weight which might not be desirable. That\u2019s where an additional concept of discounting comes into the picture. Basically, we define \u03b3 as a discounting factor and each reward after the immediate reward is discounted by this factor as follows:", "For discount factor < 1, the rewards further in the future are getting diminished. This can be understood as a tuning parameter which can be changed based on how much one wants to consider the long term (\u03b3 close to 1) or short term (\u03b3 close to 0).", "Can we use the reward function defined at each time step to define how good it is, to be in a given state for a given policy? The value function denoted as v(s) under a policy \u03c0 represents how good a state is for an agent to be in.

Given an MDP and an arbitrary policy \u03c0, we will compute the state-value function. This is called policy evaluation in the DP literature. The idea is to turn bellman expectation equation discussed earlier to an update.", "To produce each successive approximation vk+1 from vk, iterative policy evaluation applies the same operation to each state s. It replaces the old value of s with a new value obtained from the old values of the successor states of s, and the expected immediate rewards, along all the one-step transitions possible under the policy being evaluated, until it converges to the true value function of a given policy \u03c0.", "Let us understand policy evaluation using the very popular example of Gridworld.", "A bot is required to traverse a grid of 4\u00d74 dimensions to reach its goal (1 or 16).

Consider a random policy for which, at every state, the probability of every action {up, down, left, right} is equal to 0.25. We will start with initialising v0 for the random policy to all 0s.", "This is definitely not very useful.

Hence, for all these states, v2(s) = -2.", "If we repeat this step several times, we get v\u03c0:", "Using policy evaluation we have determined the value function v for an arbitrary policy \u03c0. We know how good our current policy is. Now for some state s, we want to understand what is the impact of taking an action a that does not pertain to policy \u03c0.\u00a0 Let\u2019s say we select a in s, and after that we follow the original policy \u03c0. The value of this way of behaving is represented as:", "If this happens to be greater than the value function v\u03c0(s), it implies that the new policy \u03c0\u2019 would be better to take. We do this iteratively for all states to find the best policy. Note that in this case, the agent would be following a greedy policy in the sense that it is looking only one step ahead.", "Let\u2019s get back to our example of gridworld. Using v\u03c0, the value function obtained for random policy \u03c0, we can improve upon \u03c0 by following the path of highest value (as shown in the figure below). We start with an arbitrary policy, and for each state one step look-ahead is done to find the action leading to the state with the highest value. This is done successively for each state.", "As shown below for state 2, the optimal action is left which leads to the terminal state having a value . This is the highest among all the next states (0,-18,-20). This is repeated for all states to find the new policy.", "Overall, after the policy improvement step using v\u03c0, we get the new policy \u03c0\u2019:", "Looking at the new policy, it is clear that it\u2019s much better than the random policy. However, we should calculate v\u03c0\u2019 using the policy evaluation technique we discussed earlier to verify this point and for better understanding.", "Once the policy has been improved using v\u03c0 to yield a better policy \u03c0\u2019, we can then compute v\u03c0\u2019 to improve it further to \u03c0\u2019\u2019. Repeated iterations are done to converge approximately to the true value function for a given policy \u03c0 (policy evaluation). Improving the policy as described in the policy improvement section is called policy iteration.", "In this way, the new policy is sure to be an improvement over the previous one and given enough iterations, it will return the optimal policy. This sounds amazing but there is a drawback \u2013 each iteration in policy iteration itself includes another iteration of policy evaluation that may require multiple sweeps through all the states. Value iteration technique discussed in the next section provides a possible solution to this.", "We saw in the gridworld example that at around k = 10, we were already in a position to find the optimal policy. So, instead of waiting for the policy evaluation step to converge exactly to the value function v\u03c0, we could stop earlier.", "We can also get the optimal policy with just 1 step of policy evaluation followed by updating the value function repeatedly (but this time with the updates derived from bellman optimality equation). Let\u2019s see how this is done as a simple backup operation:", "This is identical to the bellman update in policy evaluation, with the difference being that we are taking the maximum over all actions. Once the updates are small enough, we can take the value function obtained as final and estimate the optimal policy corresponding to that.", "Some important points related to DP:", "It is of utmost importance to first have a defined environment in order to test any kind of policy for solving an MDP efficiently.

To illustrate dynamic programming here, we will use it to navigate the Frozen Lake environment.", "The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.", "The surface is described using a grid like the following:", "The idea is to reach the goal from the starting point by walking only on frozen surface and avoiding all the holes. Installation details and documentation is available at this link.", "Once gym library is installed, you can just open a jupyter notebook to get started.", "Now, the env variable contains all the information regarding the frozen lake environment.
