In fact, a Harvard Business Review publication confirmed what we always knew:\u00a0analytics teams spend 80%\u00a0of their time preparing data. And they are typically slowed down by clunky data preparation tools coupled with a scarcity of data science experts.", "But not for much longer, folks! RapidMiner recently released a really nice functionality for data preparation, RapidMiner Turbo Prep. You will soon know why we picked this name \ud83d\ude42, but the basic idea is that Turbo Prep provides a new data preparation experience that is fast and fun to use with a drag and drop interface.", "Let\u2019s walk through some of the possibilities of this feature, as well as demonstrate how it integrates with\u00a0RapidMiner Auto Model, our automated machine learning product. These two features truly make data prep and machine learning fast, fun, and simple. If you would like to follow along, make sure you have\u00a0RapidMiner Studio 9.0 downloaded.\u00a0All free users have access to Auto Model and Turbo Prep for 30 days.", "First, we\u2019re going to start by loading some data. Data can be added from all repository-based sources or be imported from your local machine.", "In this example, we\u2019re using a dataset of all the domestic flights leaving from New England in 2007, roughly 230,000 rows. You can find this dataset inside Studio\u2019s pre-installed repository. Click \u2018Load Data\u2019 / \u2018Community Samples\u2019 / \u2018Community Data Sets\u2019 / \u2018Transportation\u2019.", "Once you load the data it can be seen immediately in a data-centric view, along with some data quality indicators. At the top of the columns, the distributions and quality measurements of the data are displayed. These indicate whether the columns will be helpful for machine learning and modeling. Say, for example, the majority of the data in a column is missing, this could confuse a machine learning model, so it is often better to remove it all together. If the column acts as an ID, that means practically all of the values only occur once in the data set, so this not useful for identifying patterns, and also should be removed.", "Data centric view of RapidMiner Turbo Prep", "As a first step, in order to look at the data in aggregate, we are going to create a pivot table. To generate this pivot table, first, we will look at the airport codes, indicated by \u2018Origin\u2019, with the airport name \u2018OriginName\u2019, and calculate the average delay at these locations. We can see the result immediately by dragging \u2018DepDelay\u2019 into the \u2018Aggregates\u2019 area, which calculates the average. In this case, the biggest delays are happening at the Nantucket airport, which is a very small airport; there is a high average delay of more than 51 minutes. In order to take the number of flights into account, we will also add in \u2018Origin count\u2019 and sort to show the largest airport by flight. In this case, Boston Logan Airport is the largest with almost 130,000 flights.", "Pivot table in RapidMiner Turbo Prep", "This pivot table helped us quickly determine that we should focus on Boston Logan, so we will exit out of this view and go back to the original data we started with. Now, to only show \u2018BOS\u2019 flight data: select the \u2018Origin\u2019 column, right click, and select \u2018Transformations\u2019, then \u2018Filter\u2019. Immediately, there will be a preview of the data, so you know whether the results are correct. All the statistics and quality measurements are updated as well.", "Next, we\u2019re going to bring in some additional data about the weather in New England for the same year. This data set can be found in the same \u2018Transportation\u2019 folder as the flight data. We know from personal experience, that weather can create delays, so we want to add this data in to see if the model picks up on it. In a longer scenario, we might take a look at the flight data alone at first and discover that the model is 60% accurate. Then add in the weather information and see how the accuracy of the model improves. But for this demonstration, we will go straight to adding in the weather. In this data, there is a single \u2018Date\u2019 column but in our flight data there were two columns, one for the day and one for the month, so we\u2019ll need to transform the weather data to match.", "Single \u2018Date\u2019 Column in weather data", "Start the transformation by copying the \u2018Date\u2019 column so there are two duplicate columns next to each other. Then rename the columns to \u2018W_Day\u2019 and \u2018W_Month\u2019 for consistency.", "Copied and renamed \u2018Date\u2019 columns in weather data", "Then we need to split the data from these columns. To do so, click on the \u2018W_Day\u2019 column and select \u2018Change Type\u2019 which will display \u2018Change to number\u2019 with the option to \u2018Extract\u2019. In this case we need to extract the day relative to the month and click \u2018Apply\u2019. In the case of the \u2018W_Month\u2019 column, we need to follow the same steps, except we need to extract the month relative to the year and click \u2018Apply\u2019. Once the results look good, we commit the transformation.", "Extracting the day from the month", "Extracting the month from the year", "Now,\u00a0we need to merge the two data sets together.\u00a0Turbo Prep uses\u00a0smart algorithms\u00a0to intelligently identify data matches.\u00a0Two data sets are a good match if they have two columns that match with each other.\u00a0And two columns match well with each other if they contain similar values.\u00a0In this example, we see a pretty high match of 94%.", "% match of the two data sets", "Now\u00a0if we would like to join on the airport code, we select merge type \u2018Inner Join\u2019 and \u2018AirportCode\u2019 from the dropdown,\u00a0and it ranks the best matching columns. The best match is the\u202f\u2018Origin\u2019\u202fcode column in the other data set, which is a good\u00a0sign. Next, we pick the month and the month pops up to the top showing it\u2019s the best match.\u202fLast, we select day and \u2018DayofMonth\u2019,\u00a0which\u00a0is at the top of the list as the best match.\u00a0This is helpful to make sure that the joins and merges deliver the correct results.\u00a0Clicking \u2018Update preview\u2019 will show us\u00a0the three\u00a0joined keys\u00a0in purple, all of the weather information\u00a0in blue, and all of the original flight information for Boston Logan\u00a0in green.", "Next, we\u00a0will\u00a0generate a new column\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0existing information\u00a0in our data sets. The data in the \u2018DepDelay\u2019 column\u00a0indicates the number of minutes the flight was delayed.\u00a0If a flight is a minute late, we would not (for this purpose)\u00a0actually\u00a0consider that to be delayed so this column, as is,\u00a0isn\u2019t all that important to us.\u00a0What we\u00a0want\u00a0to do is\u00a0use this column to\u00a0define\u00a0what a delay is.\u00a0For this example, we will consider any flights more than 15 minutes\u00a0late\u00a0as a delay.\u00a0To\u00a0generate\u00a0this\u00a0new column,\u00a0we\u00a0will click \u2018Generate\u2019 and\u00a0will start by\u00a0creating a\u00a0new column called \u2018Delay Class\u2019. Next, we can\u00a0either\u00a0drag in\u00a0or type out,\u00a0the formula of \u2018if()\u2019. The drag in, or type out \u2018DepDelay\u2019 where\u00a0a delay\u00a0greater\u00a0than fifteen minutes\u00a0is\u00a0true,\u00a0and\u00a0the rest\u00a0is\u00a0false. Ultimately, the formula will read, \u2018if([DepDelay]>15,TRUE,FALSE)\u2019. Then,\u00a0we want to update the preview to see the amount of false versus\u00a0true. In our case, the formula seems to work, so we commit the Generate and the new column is added.", "The last step before Modeling,\u00a0here,\u00a0is cleansing our data. When we first saw our data, we could see a couple of data quality issues indicated, for example,\u00a0in the \u2018Cancellation\u2019 column, so we know that needs to be addressed. We could go through the data column by column,\u00a0or we could use the \u2018Auto Cleansing\u2019 feature.\u00a0Clicking on that feature will pop up a dialogue box, prompting us to identify what we would like to predict.", "RapidMiner Turbo Prep auto cleansing option", "Defining a target in auto cleanse", "Based on that\u00a0selection, RapidMiner suggests and selects the columns that should be removed. These are suggested because there is too much data missing or because the data is too stable, for example.\u00a0By simply clicking \u2018Next\u2019 those columns are removed. There are more ways to improve the data quality, but that step is the only one we will use for this example,\u00a0leaving\u00a0the rest to the default settings. Then,\u00a0we click \u2018Commit Cleanse\u2019.", "Removing columns with quality issues in auto cleanse", "We made quite a few changes and we can review them all by clicking on \u2018History\u2019, which shows all of the individual steps we took.\u00a0If we want to, we can\u00a0click on one of the steps and decide to roll back the changes before that step or create a copy of the rollback step.", "Possibly the most exciting aspect of Turbo Prep is that we\u00a0can\u00a0see the full data preparation process by clicking \u2018Process\u2019, leading to a fully annotated view in\u00a0RapidMiner\u00a0Studio.\u00a0There are no black boxes in RapidMiner.\u00a0We\u00a0can see every step and can make edits and changes as necessary.\u00a0Whenever we see a model that we like, we can click on it and can open the process.

It is\u00a0important\u00a0that Auto Model is pointing out the \u2018DepDelay\u2019 as a suspicious column because this is the column that we used to create our predictions. If you recall,\u00a0when the\u00a0\u2018DepDelay\u2019 is greater than 15 minutes\u00a0late\u00a0then this is\u00a0a delay, otherwise, it is not.\u00a0If we kept\u00a0this in,\u00a0all of\u00a0the models would focus on that one column and that is not what we want to base our predictions on, so we have to remove the column.\u00a0In this case, we are also going to remove the other two suspicious columns\u00a0by clicking \u2018Deselect Yellow\u2019\u00a0but those could stay in.
