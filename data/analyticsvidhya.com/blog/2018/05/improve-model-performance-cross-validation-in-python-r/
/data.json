This trend is based on\u00a0participant rankings on the public and private leaderboards.", "One thing that stood out was that participants who rank higher on the public leaderboard lose their position after their ranks gets validated on the private leaderboard. Some even failed to secure rank in the top 20s on the private leaderboard (image below).", "Eventually, I discovered\u00a0the phenomenon which brings such ripples on the leaderboard.", "Take a guess! What could be the possible reason for high variation in these ranks? In other words, why does their model lose stability\u00a0when evaluated on the private leaderboard?", "In this article, we will look at possible reasons for this. We will also look at the concept of cross validation and a few common methods to perform it.", "Note: This article is meant for every aspiring data scientist keen to improve his/her performance in data science competitions. Each technique is followed by code snippets from both R and Python.", "Let\u2019s understand this using the below snapshot illustrating the fit of various models:", "Here, we are trying to\u00a0find the relationship between size and price. To achieve this, we have taken the following steps:", "A common\u00a0practice in\u00a0data science competitions is to\u00a0iterate over various models to find a\u00a0better performing model. However, it becomes difficult to distinguish whether this improvement in score is coming because we are capturing the relationship better, or we are just over-fitting the data. To find the right answer for this question, we use validation techniques. This method helps us in achieving more generalized relationships.", "Cross Validation is a technique which involves\u00a0reserving a particular sample of a dataset on which you do not train the model. Later, you test your model on this sample before finalizing it.", "Here are the steps involved in cross validation:", "There are various methods available for performing cross validation. I\u2019ve discussed a few of them in this section.", "In this approach, we reserve 50% of the dataset for validation and the remaining 50% for model training. However, a\u00a0major disadvantage of this approach is that since we are training a model on only 50% of the dataset, there is a huge possibility that we might miss out on some interesting information about the data which will lead to a higher bias.", "In this approach, we reserve only one data point from the available dataset, and train the model on the rest of the data. This process iterates for each data point. This also has its own advantages and disadvantages. Let\u2019s look at them:", "LOOCV leaves one data point out. Similarly, you could leave p training examples out to have validation set of size p for each iteration. This is called LPOCV (Leave P Out Cross Validation)", "From the above two validation methods, we\u2019ve learnt:", "Do\u00a0we have a method which takes care of all these\u00a03 requirements?", "Yes! That method is known as\u00a0\u201ck-fold cross validation\u201d. It\u2019s easy to follow and implement.\u00a0Below are the steps for it:", "Below is the visualization of a k-fold validation when k=10.", "Now, one of most commonly asked questions is,\u00a0\u201cHow to choose the right value of k?\u201d.", "Always remember, a lower value of k is more biased, and hence undesirable. On the other hand, a higher value of\u00a0K is less biased, but can suffer from large variability. It is important to know that a smaller value of k always\u00a0takes us towards validation set approach, whereas a higher value of k leads to LOOCV approach.", "Precisely, LOOCV is equivalent to n-fold cross validation where n is the number of training examples.", "Stratification is the process of rearranging the data so as to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole. For example, in a binary classification problem where each class comprises of 50% of the data, it is best to arrange the data such that in every fold, each class comprises of about half the instances.", "It is generally a better approach when dealing with both bias and variance. A randomly selected fold might not adequately represent the minor class, particularly in cases where there is a huge class imbalance.", "Python code snippet for stratified k-fold cross validation:", "Having said that, if the train set does not adequately represent the entire population, then using a stratified k-fold might not be the best idea. In such cases, one should use a simple k-fold cross validation with repetition.", "In repeated cross-validation, the cross-validation procedure is repeated n times, yielding n random partitions of the original sample. The n results are again averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation.", "Python code for repeated k-fold cross validation:", "When dealing with real datasets, there are often cases where the test and train sets are very different. As a result, the internal cross-validation techniques might give scores that are not even in the ballpark of the test score. In such cases, adversarial validation offers an interesting solution.", "The general idea is to check the degree of similarity between training and tests in terms of feature distribution. If It does not seem to be the case, we can suspect they are quite different. This intuition can be quantified by combining train and test sets, assigning 0/1 labels (0 \u2013 train, 1-test) and evaluating a binary classification task.", "Let us understand, how this can be accomplished in the below steps:", "val_set_ids will get you the ids from the train set that would constitute the validation set which is most similar to the test set. This will make your validation strategy more robust for cases where the train and test sets are highly dissimilar.", "However, you must be careful while using this type of validation technique. Once the distribution of the test set changes, the validation set might no longer be a good subset to evaluate your model on.", "Splitting a time-series dataset randomly does not work because the time section of your data will be messed up. For a time series forecasting problem, we perform cross validation in the following manner.", "We progressively select a new train and test set. We start with a train set which has a minimum number of observations needed for fitting the model. Progressively, we change our train and test sets with each fold. In most cases, 1 step forecasts might not be very important. In such instances, the forecast origin can be shifted to allow for multi-step errors to be used. For example, in a regression problem, the following code could be used for performing cross validation.", "h = 1 implies that we are taking the error only for 1 step ahead forecasts.", "(h =4) 4-step ahead error is depicted in the below diagram. This could be used if you want to evaluate your model for multi-step forecast.", "Unfortunately, there is no single method that works best for all kinds of problem statements. Often, a custom cross validation technique based on a feature, or combination of features, could be created if that gives the user stable cross validation scores while making submissions in hackathons.", "For example, in the recently finished contest \u2018Lord of the Machines\u2018 by Analytics Vidhya, the most stable validation technique used by the top finishers was using the campaign\u00a0id variable.", "Please have a look at the problem statement and a few approaches discussed by the participants at this thread.", "After k-fold cross validation, we\u2019ll get k different model estimation errors (e1, e2 \u2026..ek).\u00a0In an ideal scenario, these error values should sum up to zero. To return the model\u2019s bias, we take the average of all the errors. Lower the average value, better the model.", "Similarly for calculating the model variance, we take standard deviation of all the errors. A low value of standard deviation\u00a0suggests\u00a0our\u00a0model does not vary a lot with different subsets of training data.", "We should focus on achieving a balance between bias and variance. This can be done by reducing the variance and controlling\u00a0bias to an extent. It\u2019ll result in a better predictive model. This trade-off usually leads to building less complex predictive models as well. For understanding bias-variance trade-off in more depth, please refer to section 9 of this article.", "In this article, we discussed about overfitting and methods like cross-validation to avoid overfitting. We also looked at different cross-validation methods like validation set approach, LOOCV, k-fold cross validation, stratified k-fold and so on, followed by each approach\u2019s implementation in Python and R performed on the Iris dataset.", "Did you find this article helpful?
