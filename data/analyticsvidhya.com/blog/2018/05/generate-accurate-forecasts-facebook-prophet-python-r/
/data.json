Questions like how much inventory to maintain, how much footfall do you expect in your store to how many people will travel by an airline \u2013 all of these are important time series problems to solve.", "This is why\u00a0time series forecasting is one of the must-know techniques for any data scientist. From predicting the weather to the sales of a product, it is integrated into the data science ecosystem and that makes it a mandatory addition to a data scientist\u2019s skillset.", "If you are a beginner, time series also provides a good way to start working on real life projects. You can relate to time series very easily and they help you enter the larger world of machine learning.", "Prophet is an open source library published by Facebook that is based on decomposable (trend+seasonality+holidays) models. It provides us with the ability to make time series predictions with good accuracy using simple intuitive parameters and has support for including impact of custom seasonality and holidays!", "In this article, we shall cover some background on how Prophet fills the existing gaps in generating fast reliable forecasts followed by a demonstration using Python. The final results will surprise you!", "When a forecasting model doesn\u2019t run as planned, we want to be able to tune the parameters of the method with regards to the specific problem at hand. Tuning these methods requires a thorough understanding of how\u00a0the underlying time series models work. The first input parameters to automated ARIMA,\u00a0for instance, are the maximum orders of the differencing, the auto-regressive components,\u00a0and the moving average components. A typical analyst will not know how to adjust these\u00a0orders to avoid the behaviour and this is the type of expertise that is hard to acquire and scale.", "The Prophet package provides intuitive parameters which are easy to tune. Even someone who lacks expertise in forecasting models can use this to make meaningful predictions for a variety of problems in a business scenario.", "We use a decomposable time series model with three main\u00a0model components: trend, seasonality, and holidays. They are combined in the following\u00a0equation:", "Using time as a regressor, Prophet is trying to fit several linear and non linear functions of time as components.\u00a0Modeling seasonality as an additive component is the\u00a0same approach taken by exponential smoothing in Holt-Winters technique .\u00a0We are, in effect, framing the forecasting problem as a curve-fitting exercise rather than looking explicitly at the time based dependence of each observation within a time series.", "Trend is modelled by fitting a piece wise linear curve over the trend or the non-periodic part of the time series. The linear fitting exercise ensures that it is least affected by spikes/missing data.", "An important question to ask here is \u2013 Do we expect the target to keep growing/falling for the entire forecast interval?", "More often than not, there are cases with non-linear growth with a running maximum capacity. I will illustrate this with an example below.", "Let\u2019s say we are trying to forecast number of downloads of an app in a region for the next 12 months. The maximum downloads is always capped by the total number of smartphone users in the region. The number of smartphone users will also, however, increase with time.", "With domain knowledge at his/her disposal, an analyst can then define a varying capacity C(t) for the time series forecasts he/she is trying to make.", "Another question to answer is whether my time series encounters any underlying changes in the phenomena e.g. a new product launch, unforeseen calamity etc. \u00a0At such points, the growth rate is allowed to change. These changepoints are automatically selected. However, a user can also feed the changepoints manually if it is required. In the below plot, the dotted lines represent the changepoints for the given time series.", "As the number of changepoints allowed is increased the fit becomes more flexible. There are basically 2 problems an analyst might face while working with the trend component:", "A parameter called changepoint_prior_scale could be used to adjust the trend flexibility and tackle the above 2 problems. Higher value will fit a more flexible curve to the time series.", "To fit and forecast the effects of seasonality, prophet relies on fourier series to provide a flexible model. Seasonal effects s(t) are approximated by the following function:", "P is the period (365.25 for yearly data and 7 for weekly data)", "Parameters [a1, b1, \u2026.., aN, bN] need to be estimated for a given N to model seasonality.", "The fourier order N that defines whether high frequency changes are allowed to be modelled is an important parameter to set here. For a time series, if the user believes the high frequency components are just noise and should not be considered for modelling, he/she could set the values of N from to a lower value. If not, N can be tuned to a higher value and set using the forecast accuracy.", "Holidays and events incur predictable shocks to a time series. For instance, Diwali in India occurs on a different day each year and a large portion of the population buy a lot of new items during this period.", "Prophet allows the analyst to provide a custom list of\u00a0 past and future events. A window around such days are considered separately and additional parameters are fitted to model the effect of holidays and events.", "Currently implementations of Prophet are available in both Python and R. They have exactly the same features.", "Prophet() function is used do define a Prophet forecasting model in Python. Let us look at the most important parameters:", "yearly_seasonality,\u00a0weekly_seasonality & daily_seasonality can take values as True, False and no of fourier terms which was discussed in the last section. If the value is True, default number of fourier terms (10) are taken. Prior scales are defined to tell the model how strongly it needs to consider the seasonal/holiday components while fitting and forecasting.", "Now that we are well versed with nuts and bolts of this amazing tool. Lets dive into a real dataset to see its potential. Here I have used Prophet in python for one of the practice problems available on datahack platform at this link.", "The dataset is a univariate time series that contains hourly passenger traffic for a new public transport service. We are trying to forecast the traffic for next 7 months given historical traffic data of last 25 months. Basic EDA for this can be accessed from this course.", "We see that this time series has a lot of noise. We could re-sample it day wise and sum to get a new series with reduced and noise and thereby easier to model.", "Prophet requires the variable names in the time series to be:", "So, the next step is to convert the dataframe according to the above specifications", "We can look at the various components using the following command:", "Using the mean hourly fraction for each hour from 0 to 23, we could then convert the daily forecasts into hourly forecasts make submission. This is how our forecasts over the daily data looks like.", "This gets a score of 206 on the public leaderboard and does produce a stable model. Readers can go ahead and tweak the hyperparameters (fourier order for seasonality/changeover) to get a better score. Reader could also try and use a different technique to convert the daily predictions to hourly data for submission and may get a better score.", "Implementation in R for the same problem statement is given below.", "Prophet certainly is a good choice for producing quick accurate forecasts. It has intuitive parameters that can be tweaked by someone who has good domain knowledge but lacks technical skills in forecasting models. Readers can also try and fit Prophet directly over the hourly data and discuss in the comments if they are able to get a better result.", "IIT Bombay Graduate with a Masters and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering.\nI have previously worked as a lead decision scientist for Indian National Congress deploying statistical models (Segmentation, K-Nearest Neighbours) to help party leadership/Team make data-driven decisions.\nMy interest lies in putting data in heart of business for data-driven decision making.", " Notify me of follow-up comments by email.", " Notify me of new posts by email.", "Make Money While Sleeping: Side Hustles to Generate Passive Income..", "Google Bard Learnt Bengali on Its Own: Sundar Pichai", "FreedomGPT: Personal, Bold and Uncensored Chatbot Running Locally on Your..", "Understand Random Forest Algorithms With Examples (Updated 2023)", " A verification link has been sent to your email id ", " If you have not recieved the link please goto\nSign Up  page again\n", "This email id is not registered with us.
