\u2014 starting at $5,899.", "If you\u2019re looking for a fully turnkey deep learning system, pre-loaded with TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras, and all other deep learning applications, check them out.", "After years of using a thin client in the form of increasingly thinner MacBooks, I had gotten used to it. So when I got into Deep Learning (DL), I went straight for the brand new at the time Amazon P2 cloud servers. No upfront cost, the ability to train many models simultaneously and the general coolness of having a machine learning model out there slowly teaching itself.", "However, as time passed, the AWS bills steadily grew larger, even as I switched to 10x cheaper Spot instances. Also, I didn\u2019t find myself training more than one model at a time. Instead, I\u2019d go to lunch/workout/etc. while the model was training, and come back later with a clear head to check on it.", "But eventually, the model complexity grew and took longer to train. I\u2019d often forget what I did differently on the model that had just completed its 2-day training. Nudged by the great experiences of the other folks on the Fast.AI Forum, I decided to settle down and to get a dedicated DL box at home.", "The most important reason was saving time while prototyping models \u2014 if they trained faster, the feedback time would be shorter. Thus it would be easier for my brain to connect the dots between the assumptions I had for the model and its results.", "Then I wanted to save money \u2014 I was using Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offered P2 instances with Nvidia K80 GPUs. Lately, the AWS bills were around $60\u201370/month with a tendency to get larger. Also, it is expensive to store large datasets, like ImageNet.", "And lastly, I haven\u2019t had a desktop for over 10 years and wanted to see what has changed in the meantime (spoiler alert: mostly nothing).", "What follows are my choices, inner monologue, and gotchas: from choosing the components to benchmarking.", "A sensible budget for me would be about 2 years worth of my current compute spending. At $70/month for AWS, this put it at around $1700 for the whole thing.", "You can check out all the components used. The PC Part Picker site is also really helpful in detecting if some of the components don\u2019t play well together.", "The GPU is the most crucial component in the box. It will train these deep networks fast, shortening the feedback cycle.", "The GPU is important is because: a) most calculations in DL are matrix operations, like matrix multiplication. They can be slow if done on the CPU. b) As we are doing thousands of these operations in a typical neural network, the slowness really adds up (as we will see in the benchmarks later). On the other hand, GPUs, rather conveniently, are able to run all these operations in parallel. They have a large number of cores, which can run an even larger number of threads. GPUs also have much higher memory bandwidth which enables them to run these parallel operations on a bunch of data at once.", "Disclosure: The following are affiliate links, to help me pay for, well, more GPUs.", "The choice is between a few of Nvidia\u2019s cards: GTX 1070, GTX 1070 Ti, GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti and finally the Titan X. The prices might fluctuate, especially because some GPUs are great for cryptocurrency mining (wink, 1070, wink).", "On performance side: GTX 1080 Ti and Titan X are similar. Roughly speaking the GTX 1080 is about 25% faster than GTX 1070. And GTX 1080 Ti is about 30% faster than GTX 1080. The new GTX 1070 Ti is very close in performance to GTX 1080.", "Tim Dettmers has a great article on picking a GPU for Deep Learning, which he regularly updates as new cards come on the market.", "Here are the things to consider when picking a GPU:", "Considering all of this, I picked the GTX 1080 Ti, mainly for the training speed boost. I plan to add a second 1080 Ti soonish.", "Even though the GPU is the MVP in deep learning, the CPU still matters. For example, data preparation is usually done on the CPU. The number of cores and threads per core is important if we want to parallelize all that data prep.", "To stay on budget, I picked a mid-range CPU, the Intel i5 7500. It\u2019s relatively cheap but good enough to not slow things down.", "Edit: As a few people have pointed out: \u201cprobably the biggest gotcha that is unique to DL/multi-GPU is to pay attention to the PCIe lanes supported by the CPU/motherboard\u201d (by Andrej Karpathy). We want to have each GPU have 16 PCIe lanes so it eats data as fast as possible (16 GB/s for PCIe 3.0). This means that for two cards we need 32 PCIe lanes. However, the CPU I have picked has only 16 lanes. So 2 GPUs would run in 2x8 mode (instead of 2x16). This might be a bottleneck, leading to less than ideal utilization of the graphics cards. Thus a CPU with 40 lines is recommended.", "Edit 2: However, Tim Dettmers points out that having 8 lanes per card should only decrease performance by \u201c0\u201310%\u201d for two GPUs. So currently, my recommendation is: Go with 16 PCIe lanes per video card unless it gets too expensive for you. Otherwise, 8 lanes should do as well.", "A good solution with to have for a double GPU machine would be an Intel Xeon processor like the E5\u20131620 v4 (40 PCIe lanes).

To my delight, a new generation of SSD called NVMe has made its way to market in the meantime. A 480 GB MyDigitalSSD NVMe drive was a great deal. This baby copies files at gigabytes per second. HDD: 2 TB Seagate. While SSDs have been getting fast, HDD have been getting cheap. To somebody who has used Macbooks with 128 GB disk for the last 7 years, having this much space feels almost obscene.", "The one thing that I kept in mind when picking a motherboard was the ability to support two GTX 1080 Ti, both in the number of PCI Express Lanes (the minimum is 2x8) and the physical size of 2 cards.

Next to the processor there is a lever that needs to be pulled up. The processor is then placed on the base (double-check the orientation). Finally, the lever comes down to fix the CPU in place.", "But I had a quite the difficulty doing this: once the CPU was in position the lever wouldn\u2019t go down.
