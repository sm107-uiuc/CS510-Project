What the?", "Forgive me. I\u2019m going to be blunt, maybe even a little harsh. But then I\u2019ll be gentle, and we\u2019ll talk about all this like adults, and maybe you\u2019ll gain something from reading about why American can\u2019t seem to deal with a pandemic well (but you can be the judge of that.)", "Nobody should have expected a society as ruthlessly and lethally capitalist as America to save the average prole during a pandemic\u2026instead of exploit them all the harder. If you expected America to save you\u2026you shouldn\u2019t have. What was never expendable to capitalism was another quarter of profits\u2026another few million dollars for billionaires\u2026higher stock prices. What was expendable was you.", "(Now, \u201ccapitalist society\u201d doesn\u2019t mean your local tiny microbrewery, bakery, or drycleaner. Sorry, I\u2019m not a die hard Marxist. I love business, trade, commerce, enterprise, which are what your local bakery and microbrewery are. But capitalism, predatory capitalism, America\u2019s weirdly Soviet totalitarian capitalism \u2014 as in more money, at any cost, for vast corporate entities, who are super-people, bending every social and political and economic institution to that single one-dimensional end \u2014 is something that, at this juncture, all sane people should find problematic. Why?)", "Let me explain, beginning with a simple observation.", "Capitalist societies have long had enough homes to house everyone, enough money to pay everyone a decent income, enough food to feed everyone, more than enough professors and teachers to educate everyone, enough medicine to treat everyone. And yet they\u2019re never once \u2014 once in history \u2014 given any of those things to people. In more technical terms, capitalist societies have huge surpluses of resources \u2014 and yet people struggle as entire classes and groups for just those very things. Don\u2019t you find that odd? Striking? Bizarre? I do. It raises the question: if a society has ample resources to give everyone a better life \u2014 why on earth does it keep them from people?", "There\u2019s really only one possible answer to that question. It goes like this. In a capitalist society, you aren\u2019t seen as deserving of those things. Those are things which must be \u201cearned.\u201d But that also means: nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth. Because, of course, the definition of \u201cinherent or intrinsic worth\u201d is that I have a basic human right to things like housing and healthcare and medicine and so on.", "I want you to think about this point carefully, closely, to really interrogate it until you get it.", "If a society has ample food, medicine, money, homes \u2014 and yet people still struggle for all these things, the only conclusion is that society must not think people have any inherent worth. Why else would a society deny its own people the things it already has? And yet that is precisely where 75% of Americans are. America\u2019s a society with ample homes, money, medicine, food, and so on \u2014 and yet that\u2019s how many Americans struggle to \u201cafford\u201d these things. What the?", "All that\u2019s what Marx called exploitation and immiseration. Exploitation \u2014 you have to work for things that should be basic rights. Immiseration: society has more than enough to provide all these things for you, but for some reason that you can\u2019t quite fathom, nobody much has them. The reason is the system, the ideology, the belief. Nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth. The only point of all human existence, endeavour, thought, action is one-dimensional: making more profit.", "That is the fatal flaw at the heart of capitalism. Again, I want to distinguish it from everyday business, commerce, trade. You might be a great, awesome, wonderful CEO of that small or medium sized business, and give all your employees all the above, unconditionally. Excellent. Capitalism, on the other hand \u2014 McKinsey\u2019s storm troopers marching into a boardroom, demanding \u201crationalization\u201d, Goldman Sachs selling poisoned derivatives to small towns, both investing in concentration camps \u2014 isn\u2019t interested in any of those things.", "\u201cCapitalism doesn\u2019t allow you to have any inherent worth\u201d can be put in a simpler way: it\u2019s indifferent to life and death. Yours, in particular. It literally doesn\u2019t care if you live or die. In many respects, it\u2019s happier if you\u2019re dead. If you\u2019re a burden \u2014 in the form, of say, taxes for social systems. If you\u2019re \u201cunproductive\u201d or \u201cinefficient.\u201d If you cost it money, capitalism is much happier with you dead than alive.", "You\u2019d be fair to think I was exaggerating\u2026until, well, right now. Because right now, capitalism is demanding that Americans go back to work, risk their lives, spread a pandemic, see their loved ones die\u2026all so that profits can continue their upward spiral. Can there be a more powerful, direct, and visceral example than that of all the above? That capitalism\u2019s indifferent to you living or dying? That it prefers you dead over alive, the moment you cost it money? That in a capitalist society, nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth \u2014 in this case, the most fundamental aspect of it, which is\u2026living itself?", "A capitalist society is run for one purpose. I\u2019ve already alluded to it above. The only point of it all, and all means every single thought, action, idea, interaction, behaviour in a society, is this: to maximize profits. There\u2019s a point at which profit is earned fairly, sure \u2014 think of the local microbrewer or baker. But to capitalism, the quest for profit is endless and perpetual, which demands, in turn, harder and harder exploitation \u2014 to the point of true immiseration.", "Again, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking I was exaggerating not so long ago. But today?", "Consider this. Americans work harder than anyone else in the rich world \u2014 harder than most people in the poor world. And yet their incomes haven\u2019t risen in five decades. They don\u2019t have decent healthcare, education, retirement, childcare \u2014 any kind of social system. Meanwhile, those who \u201cown\u201d the super-people known as \u201ccorporations\u201d \u2014 entities with superhuman rights and powers \u2014 went from millionaires to billionaires to mega billionaires. Exploitative enough for you?", "But that was yesterday. Today, Americans are being exploited even harder than that. They\u2019re being made to go back to work in the face of a global pandemic. What the? How much more exploitative can a system even get? Maybe gulags, I suppose. But how different is it really being made to go back to work and risking sure death? Americans are reaching the outer limits of exploitation. What else are we to call being made to work when a fatal disease ravages a rich country?", "Yet there\u2019s exploitation, and there\u2019s immiseration. Exploitation is what\u2019s easy to see: America\u2019s bigwigs take a massive, unfair slice of the pie, thus driving the people formerly known as the middle class into poverty. Immiseration is what\u2019s harder to see: the idea that a society has enough to go around \u2014 a surplus. And yet that surplus can never be shared, precisely because capitalism can\u2019t allow such a thing to happen, because then profits would crater.", "I\u2019ve already pointed out how America has ample homes, money, food, medicine, and so on \u2014 and yet Americans struggle to \u201cafford\u201d just these things. That\u2019s immiseration. Now let\u2019s apply that concept to Americans being made to work during a pandemic.", "The point is this: Americans don\u2019t need to work during a pandemic. There is literally no reason for them to. They don\u2019t need to be made to \u201cwork\u201d for basics like homes, medicine, money, and food \u2014 society has a massive surplus of all these things already. They don\u2019t need to \u201cwork\u201d during a pandemic for a similar reason. America is easily rich enough to simply support the whole economy for a few months during the pandemic \u2014 which is the wise and right and fair and moral thing to do. Nobody needs to work. Not just because America is a rich society \u2014 but because the only \u201cwork\u201d that really needs to be done during a pandemic is tending to the ill, feeding the indigent, making sure the disease\u2019s spread is slowed, and so forth. The \u201cwork\u201d that Americans are to be made to do has literally nothing to do with any of that very real labour. (Does anyone really need a new home built right about now? How about a trip to the dentist? Or a pair of new designer jeans? Maybe you see what I mean.)", "You know and I know the real reason Americans are being made to work during a pandemic: money. So that profits rise, so that stock markets rise, so that the rich get richer. So that, in other words, the system doesn\u2019t collapse in on itself. A cynic might have an even darker interpretation: so that Americans know their place. So that they\u2019re so beaten, weary, terrified, and anxious, they never really have the time or energy to question the insanity of all the above.", "Because insanity is really the only word for it. What else would you call a society that has a massive surplus of homes, money, medicine, food \u2014 and yet 75% of people still struggle to \u201cafford\u201d these things? What the?", "That\u2019s insanity, for three reasons. First, no progress is possible. People are just made to work for things they already have. So what reason is there for anyone to really create anything new, positive, life-changing? Why bother, when you can exploit people over what they should already have \u2014 which a mobster might just call extortion?", "Second, regress tends to happen. When I feel desperate and bitter, when I grow poor and insecure, I\u2019m likely to turn to demagogues, like the idiot America has for President right about now. Third, societies like that fall apart. When I can see that my society has a surplus of the very things I need desperately \u2014 why would I trust my institutions? My leaders? The system? Anyone or anything? Bang! A society plunges into distrust and enmity and hostility and superstition that way. It literally begins to disintegrate \u2014 just the way America is.", "That\u2019s immiseration, my friends. The insanity of a society denying its people the very things it has an abundant surplus of. In America, they used to be things like medicine, food, money, education. Today \u2014 even more grimly \u2014 the thing Americans are being denied\u2026that they have an abundant surplus of is\u2026have you figured it out yet?", "It\u2019s life itself. When you\u2019re made to go back to work, during a pandemic, you risk your life. But there\u2019s literally no reason to. No reason, that is, except more profits for the ultra rich. (Yet that is no good reason at all \u2014 because, as we\u2019ve established, society has a massive surplus of just those profits. Not only that, money is denominated by life. If life has no worth \u2014 what good is money? All it can really buy is violence, the right to harm life. But I digress.)", "Americans were \u2014 until last week or so \u2014 immiserated over money, food, homes, education, medicine. Society had a huge surplus of these things, and yet Americans never had enough of them, because they were deliberately withheld. Americans were made to compete viciously and brutally over them, instead, so that profits could skyrocket forever.", "Today, Americans are being immiserated over life itself. Their institutions are literally telling them they must work \u2014 or else. On the one side, they risk losing their lives, yet on the other, they\u2019ll lose their incomes, what little healthcare and retirement and stability they have. What kind of choice is that? A choice that says: on the one side, you don\u2019t live, and on the other, you don\u2019t either.", "But these are the outer limits of immiseration, too. It\u2019s one thing for a society to withhold a surplus of homes, food, medicine, money. But life itself? As in the basic right not be infected by a global pandemic, and infect those you love, too? Just so that \u201cthe economy\u201d as in profits and stock markets for mega-corporations can \u201ckeep going\u201d, as in keep rising forever? What on earth? Can immiseration get more extreme than that, really?", "Here\u2019s one of the big secrets capitalism doesn\u2019t want you to know. The point of life isn\u2019t money. The point of money is life. The point of you isn\u2019t \u201cthe economy.\u201d The point of the economy is you. Or else the idea of \u201can economy\u201d is a contradictory, foolish, nonsensical proposition. What good is \u201can economy\u201d where we\u2019re all sick and dying, but one person\u2019s made trillions? What good is \u201can economy\u201d where living standards only ever\u2026fall\u2026because we\u2019re all being made to exploit each other\u2026and love it? That\u2019s not \u201can economy\u201d, it\u2019s just idiocy and self-destruction, collapse, and implosion into poverty and despair by any other name. And yet this is precisely and exactly where the thinking of predatory capitalism has self-evidently led.", "\u201cThe economy\u201d means nothing at all if it doesn\u2019t include your life, getting better. Not getting worse \u2014 to the point of literally hoping you don\u2019t die. If it\u2019s just money, stock markets, profits \u2014 it\u2019s meaningless. That\u2019s the central lesson of this mess: the economy and your life aren\u2019t mysteriously separate things. They are one and the same, and that our way of thinking doesn\u2019t reflect that is why we cannot ever seem to fix much of anything, or get out of our self-made messes. The economy is you, and you are the economy. Capitalism wants to separate life and \u201cthe economy\u201d precisely so that it can exploit and immiserate you, and then point to booming stock markets and roaring profits, and say: \u201cWoo-hoo! The economy\u2019s roaring!! Nothing to worry about here!!\u201d", "And yet not a single American pundit or intellectual, so far as I can see, has grasped that elemental lesson: \u201cthe economy\u201d and living standards are not distinct things, but one and the same. So let me flip that on it\u2019s head.", "You shouldn\u2019t have expected capitalism to save you during a pandemic. It was never going to. Capitalism takes you at your most vulnerable \u2014 and exploits you al the harder. It withholds a surplus of things which already exist in society \u2014 it always and always will \u2014 even if those things are safety from a pandemic. It\u2019s only purpose, like a mindless predator, is to profit, more, forever, and all you are to it is a means to this end. Those are it\u2019s rules. What was a capitalist society going to during a pandemic? Exploit. Immiserate. Who? Itself.", "When I phrase it that way, perhaps you see the grotesque tragedy and the absurd folly of it all \u2014 America, right now. What kind of a society\u2026exploits\u2026itself? What the? Shouldn\u2019t a society want to mature, develop, elevate, expand, lift, walk from the desert to the shore?", "Ah, my friends. These are the days we learn the bitter, strange truth of ourselves. If, that is, we see what\u2019s revealed to us by the hand of tragedy, and the finger of folly."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
