If you\u2019ve thought something like the above, you\u2019re exactly right. And yet because the media is doing a fairly poor job of explaining just why, let me.", "America\u2019s stimulus program gives a one-off payment of $1200 to people \u2014 and even that\u2019s conditional on income. Good enough, right? Wrong.", "Every other rich country by now has guaranteed incomes, in some form or other. Sweden, to 90%. Denmark subsidizing 75% of incomes. Take the other most capitalist society in the world, Britain Even there, incomes have been guaranteed: Britain, to 80% of income. In Europe, most nations have gone even further, making not just emergency payments to workers for as long as the crisis will last, but mortgages have already been suspended, which is another way to guarantee incomes.", "By this measure, America\u2019s paltry $1200 one-off payment looks inadequate \u2014 because it is. Deeply and profoundly so.", "Before I come to the other ways, let\u2019s discuss why America\u2019s response has been so dismal. The fear is that inflation will wrack the economy if people are to \u201cget paid for free.\u201d But nothing could be more wrong. Inflation, often misunderstood by Americans, because American economics, is to put it kindly, a joke, is really this: spirals in wages and prices.", "Now think of the average American. He or she is suddenly out of work \u2014 and facing the prospect of sudden and long-lasting bankruptcy. In other words, the average American is facing a deflationary shock. One so total, the like has never been seen in modern history. Overnight, literally, their income has gone to zero.", "That deflationary shock will ripple outwards through the economy. It will cause prices to fall, because people won\u2019t have enough money to buy the same levels of stuff. Prices for what? For everything. For houses, food, cars, and so forth. That deflation probably won\u2019t make the headlines, because they\u2019ll be full of profiteering scandals. Of course profiteering will take place, but across the larger economy, the effect of deflationary shocks will be what it always is: depression.", "Depression means: After they lose their incomes Americans will then lose their savings, their homes, whatever other assets they had, like retirement and college and funds and so forth. They will struggle to afford the basics, even more than the already did \u2014 remember, America was already an economy in which 75% struggled to pay basic bills, like food, housing, and utilities, even before Coronavirus. Now imagine them being even poorer than that.", "The stage has now been set for a depression. Precisely because idea that a danger from the government supporting people during a catastrophe is \u201cinflation\u201d is backwards \u2014 the real danger is deflation. That deflationary shock is taking place as we speak, like a mega-earthquake, an extinction level event, which is making millions of Americans go from a relatively paltry income to\u2026zero income.", "That is why a $1200 payment to people isn\u2019t nearly enough. Those jobs aren\u2019t suddenly going to magically come back. Why not? That brings me to the second reason America\u2019s Coronavirus response is inadequate.", "Businesses are already going bankrupt. How many can you count? Just take a look down your block. How many small or medium sized businesses are shuttering their doors, or on the verge? Your local bakery, brewer, butcher \u2014 if you even had one left?", "America\u2019s stimulus program offers little real support to the economy. It gives mega-corporations huge bailouts. But for everyone else, it offers little to no real support. Maybe \u2014 and I stress maybe \u2014 your average business gets a small loan or a tax break from the government. But what good is a loan or a tax break when the basis of your business has simply fallen apart? Think of a supply chain: it\u2019s a complex web of businesses. Like an ecosystem, the shock of losing customers suddenly ripples outwards and upwards. Sure, all these businesses can take on loans and get minor-league tax breaks. So what? That doesn\u2019t solve the problem of no income at all. Those businesses will all still soon fold, as their debt spirals out of control, while their revenues plunge to near zero \u2014 and no amount of tax breaks can fix that, either.", "Loans are not really a \u201cstimulus.\u201d The Fed doesn\u2019t give banks \u201cloans\u201d during a crisis \u2014 it simply throws free money at them. It literally simply puts money in their accounts in the central bank. Yes, really. That is precisely what America should have done for businesses, too. It should have guaranteed their incomes, just as it should have guaranteed personal incomes. That\u2019s what Italy and Germany did: businesses at risk don\u2019t get loans, they get grants. And in Spain and France, they get government guaranteed funds, in which \u201cguaranteed\u201d means that any debt will probably be written off after the crisis.", "Just as the sudden loss of income for people creates an extinction level deflationary shock, so too does the sudden loss of income for businesses. That deflationary shock \u2014 business\u2019s revenues suddenly falling to zero \u2014 will rip through the economy, causing mass layoffs, bankruptcies, and the extinction of whole sectors. Again: the stage for a historic depression has now been set.", "That brings me to the third and biggest reason. What\u2019s missing from this \u201cstimulus\u201d package? Take a look at those brave doctors and nurses. They\u2019re fashioning masks out of pizza boxes. They\u2019re desperately trying to get patients to share scarce ventilators. What\u2019s missing from this stimulus package is\u2026stimulus. As in the real thing.", "What does that mean? A massive, historic, generational wave of investment in healthcare like America\u2019s never seen before. Isn\u2019t it obvious that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary right about now? That America\u2019s barely functional healthcare system \u2014 and economy \u2014 can hardly cope with the magnitude of this shock? And yet, on the same day as it announced this stimulus package, the government also proclaimed it couldn\u2019t spend a billion dollars on\u2026ventilators. Wait, what? Perhaps you see the problem.", "Let me put it more plainly. This stimulus bill isn\u2019t really one. It doesn\u2019t put, say, a trillion dollars towards building new hospitals, clinics, care centers\u2026and another trillions to new labs, research facilities, university research programs. It doesn\u2019t recruit a million people or ten to do the sudden work of gearing a whole economy towards building the missing resources a society crippled by disease now urgently needs. What kind of work is that?", "This stimulus doesn\u2019t create institutions like a Works Progress Administration \u2014 only this time for people to work in factories suddenly building ventilators and masks, or a million bright young people researching pandemics harder, or an army of everyday people visiting the elderly and making sure they\u2019re ok, or legions making films about the pandemic, or writing about it \u2014 things which are the equivalent of digging ditches during a pandemic. Yet think about how much of that is the necessary, crucial work of this moment. Think how much work there is to really do \u2014 from building the resources we need, whether simple things like ventilators and masks, to doing new research and development, fast, to manning and managing it all, to chronicling this moment in literature and film, to building whole new hospitals and clinics, to creating a whole new sector of crisis planning.", "This stimulus doesn\u2019t do any of that. It doesn\u2019t even have a billion dollars for the scarcest and most urgently necessary resource of all \u2014 ventilators, for Pete\u2019s sake \u2014 let alone new hospitals and clinics, or staffing existing ones better.", "The result is that America\u2019s economy is still scarce of the resources it needs most to fight this pandemic, like ventilators and masks. This stimulus isn\u2019t one because it doesn\u2019t invest in anything new at all.", "Let me put all that in more formal, technical terms. A stimulus is not a stimulus when it doesn\u2019t create any resources, lead to any larger surplus, in society. A stimulus is a stimulus when it suddenly, massively invests in society, so that new resources can be created. Often, whole new institutions must be built \u2014 like the Depression\u2019s WPA or Reconstruction Finance Corporation \u2014 to coordinate and manage those investments.", "The whole point of a stimulus is to suddenly, rapidly expand society\u2019s surplus of resources \u2014 especially desperately necessary ones \u2014 or it isn\u2019t a stimulus at all. Those desperately necessary resources differ from crisis to crisis. What are they this time around? Ventilators. Masks. Hospitals. Care workers. Factories. Transportation. Meanwhile, mass unemployment has set in.", "See the obvious solution? The government can and should \u201cemploy\u201d people who are suddenly unemployed and broke to balance that equation \u2014 to create those desperately necessary resources. If it needs to create new institutions to do that \u2014 A Healthcare Crisis Agency, a Pandemic Response Bank, a Reconstruction Finance Corporation \u2014 all the better: even more people are employed to create another scarce resource, planning and coordinating. That is what a stimulus is \u2014 when we genuinely take collective action to invest together to create a surplus of critical resources that we suddenly, desperately lack.", "This bill literally does none of that. As in: zero. And in that way, it\u2019s not a stimulus at all. What it is is a bailout. It\u2019s a rescue of corporations and Wall St and the same old. It\u2019s a bailout of capitalism \u2014 at the expense of the economy, people, and life itself.", "What\u2019s a depression? A society in desperate scarcity \u2014 whether of money, homes, income, medicine, and so on, the basics \u2014 usually, as the result of a sudden, catastrophic shock. The correct result is a real stimulus \u2014 as Keynes discovered a century ago \u2014 precisely so that society can have a surplus of those critical resources. Otherwise, a deflationary spiral sets in: wages and prices fall in tandem, and people get sharply poorer in real terms, fast. The prices of these few critical resources rise, of course \u2014 but only amidst fresh and terrible poverty.", "But that poverty is disaster added to catastrophe. Because depression results from some shock \u2014 the loss of a war, natural calamity, in this case, pandemic. Poverty is a consequence of inaction, folly, negligence \u2014 the lack of collective action and shared investment.", "America\u2019s response to Coronavirus is as flawed and inadequate as you probably think. Compared to other rich countries, America is essentially doing next to nothing. It sets the stage for depression \u2014 by being a bailout of capitalism\u2019s mega-rich, who already have too much, while the average person and his or her small business have long had too little. Instead of massively investing to create a surplus of critical resources, it\u2026doesn\u2019t invest in anything at all.", "That is why we will go on hearing surreal horror stories about doctors making masks from pizza boxes and nurses dying because they treated the sick without protective gear\u2026even as we lose our own jobs and incomes\u2026while the mega-rich go on laughing all the way to the bank.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong. This stimulus is better than nothing. But what it isn\u2019t is nearly good enough for a society as broken as America to be able to cope with catastrophe \u2014 much less grow as an improbable result of it.", "There\u2019s another, harder, way to put all that. Did you really expect a ruthlessly capitalist society to be able to save itself from a pandemic? Or was it always just going to use it as a way to exploit people even harder? Sadly, the answer, my friends, is one every country but America knows by now."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
