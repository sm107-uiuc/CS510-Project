If so, then maybe you\u2019ve observed what I have. Something\u2019s going badly wrong in our organizations. At every scale\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Perhaps you think, as I do, that the world is in a troubled place these days. If so, then maybe you\u2019ve observed what I have.", "Something\u2019s going badly wrong in our organizations. At every scale. Whether they\u2019re countries, corporations, cities, towns, governments, parties. They seem to be rife with a peculiar set of strikingly similar problems. Inequality. Inopportunity. A lack of meaning, purpose. A deficit of truth. Unfairness. Predation. An empty place where dignity, truth, and vision should be.", "Why is that? It seems, to put it bluntly, as if our organizations empower and reward the worst among us \u2014 worse yet, not for creating anything of real value, whether products, services, ideas, art, science, literature, but for allowing the most ruthless, cunning, and unscrupulous to take from the decent and humble. Take what? Pretty much anything you can think of. Consider the example of America: life expectancy is now declining for the poorest, and will do so soon enough for the middle, since healthcare is unaffordable \u2014 life itself is being taken, and given to the richest. Income, opportunity, savings, safety, security, stability \u2014 all these are being taken, too.", "So. Here\u2019s a tiny principle for creating the future, for those who really wish to be innovators, explorers, rebels, and usurpers. The organizations that we build must be models of the world we want to create.", "(Think of compasses as you read this. I\u2019ll come back that metaphor. First\u2026)", "What do I mean by that strange little phrase? Consider how the organizations we build aren\u2019t models of the world we want to create. Facebook\u2019s gotten rich by creating nothing of real value \u2014 it makes us unhappy, lonely, mean, and it corrodes democracy, trust, and society. And yet it\u2019s putative purpose is to \u201cconnect the world\u201d. Ironic, no? It\u2019s a broken compass.", "Most of our organizations have similarly noble, wonderful aims. Google, Uber, Tesla. Every venture capital fund in the universe. Every blue chip company, government, political party. But their net effect on well-being appears to be if not negative, then zero \u2014 that much is obvious, because life itself is going into reverse along nearly every dimension. Why is that? Is it just because they\u2019re not trying? Because it\u2019s all a cynical game? I think there\u2019s a deeper reason \u2014 they are not modelling the world that they want to build.", "Our organizations often say that they want to do noble and wonderful things. Build a more prosperous, thriving, and explosively better world. One overflowing with happiness, meaning, and purpose. But take a clear-eyed look inside those very organizations. What do you see?", "You see overwork and stress being the biggest factor in a falling a low quality of life. You see people a total lack of meaning and purpose \u2014 people working on utterly trivial things, like new flavours of deodorant. You see \u201cperformance systems\u201d that measure how many hours are worked, or how politically successful people are \u2014 not whether they\u2019ve contributed to creating better lives. You see \u201cboards\u201d that appear not to care or even know when democracies are being hacked. But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.", "You see the same old hierarchies and the same old glass ceilings. You see CEOs earning hundreds of times what workers do. You see women and minorities and anyone different, really, systemically discriminated against. You see \u201cdiversity\u201d equalling tokenism. You see noble statements of grand innovation and breakthroughs \u2014 but hard dollars spent on lowest-common-denominator stuff. You will see a lack of investment in people, society, trust, meaning, purpose, in elevating and expanding quality of life \u2014 and destructive activities like share buybacks, lobbying, more ad campaigns, and bigger bonuses for all that.", "In short, if you look at organizations today, whether big or small, corporate or entrepreneurial, you see a great contradiction. Our organizations say that they want to build a better world. But they are rife with inopportunity, unfairness, stagnation, discrimination, meanness, pettiness, cruelty, and spite. It\u2019s no surprise, then, all that is what\u2019s happening in economy after economy. After all, organizations are what economies are made of. But the result of economies like that is that people turn to authoritarianism, extremism, and scapegoating. Broken compasses take us in circles, don\u2019t they?", "Do you see the link? Our organizations are like little ships trying to sail to a new world. But they are still being run and organized like the old one. How can they really go anywhere? Broken compasses. Circles.", "So. Our organizations must be models of the world that we want to build. Not just examples of the old one. What kind of world is that? You tell me. Perhaps it is a more inclusive, just, gentle world. Then the challenge for your organization is modelling all that, first \u2014 you must reward, motivate, and inspire people to really see each other, instead of hoping that the world will be a better place, while you impel people to be unfair, hard, and cruel, with winner-take-all structures and systems, which recognize no one\u2019s dignity, humanity, or purpose. You\u2019re nothing but a broken compass that way.", "Perhaps it is a more prosperous, thriving world. Then you must be one, too. Instead of paying CEOs hundreds of millions, and workers mere thousands, you must redress the gap. You\u2019re going to have to stop issuing mega-bonuses for useless financial engineering, and start rewarding people for really making a difference. You\u2019re going to have to build cultures, values, and whole structures and systems for a razor-sharp higher purpose. How can the world be a more prosperous place if the very organizations that should make it one themselves aren\u2019t?", "See what I mean by being a compass? Let me zoom out so it\u2019s clearer.", "What does \u201corganizational leadership\u201d really mean? We think that it means \u201cbest practices\u201d and \u201chiring the best talent\u201d and all the other buzzwords. It doesn\u2019t. All that\u2019s quite pointless now. Obsolete. Useless. Organizational leadership today means building an organization that is a model for the world it hopes to create. That models \u2014 demonstrates, displays, shows, exemplifies, for all to see\u2014 the better world that it hopes to spark. As exactly and precisely as it can. It\u2019s not just about your products, services, goods \u2014 but the marrow of your very organization itself, how it works, what it does, whom it benefits, why it exists.", "A leader is a model. Someone that blazes a trail. Others follow. They imitate, taking the same footsteps. But the leader goes first. But our organizations are not modelling the world that they wish and hope to create. They are still reflections, vessels, systems of the old world \u2014 the one they themselves often are frustrated by and weary of. It does no good to cry \u201cI want a new world!\u201d \u2014 and then go on every day simply living in the old one. Such organizations have not become a compass.", "To be an organizational leader today means stepping forward and modelling the better world that you want to create. Building a little version of it. That can set a true north. That says: \u201cHere is the new world that we want to build. Fairer, more prosperous, truer, more meaningful, full of purpose \u2014 better in all these ways. That new world exists here already. We are a model for everyone to follow. A compass towards the future.\u201d", "That will not be easy. It will require those who really wish to innovate to turn it all upside down. To throw out many of the old rules. Of \u201cboards\u201d, of \u201cstructures\u201d, of \u201crewards\u201d, of \u201croles\u201d and \u201ctitles\u201d and \u201cbosses\u201d. What good do they really do now? Is a company like Facebook that has textbook organization \u2014 a stellar board and rock-solid structures and skyrocketing compensation \u2014 any better run than one that doesn\u2019t? You see my point. That is the way that we must walk if we wish to be leaders.", "We must build organizations that are models of the world we want to create. Or else we are not really creating the future at all \u2014 just recreating the past. Be the change you want to see in the world, a great man once said. It has never been truer than now. The greatest organizations of a better tomorrow will be the compasses that get us there today."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
