Thanks to CSS custom properties most of the \"theming work\" is done with CSS. It is a more scalable and faster way to theme React apps."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://bit.dev", "anchor_text": "Bit", "paragraph_index": 5}, {"url": "https://bit.dev", "anchor_text": "Bit", "paragraph_index": 5}, {"url": "https://bit.dev", "anchor_text": "Bit.dev", "paragraph_index": 5}], "all_paragraphs": ["Up until lately, whenever we\u2019d think of changing themes in run-time, we\u2019d immediately go for some sort of a JS/JSX solution. That could be either theming through higher-order components, passing themes as props (usually with the help of React.Context) or using popular libraries like styled-components.", "Today, thanks to \u2018CSS custom properties\u2019, a.k.a \u2018CSS variables\u2019, we shift the weight towards plain CSS. That is to say, there\u2019s still a need for some JavaScript but as you\u2019ll see, it plays a much minor role.", "As a rule of thumb, the more we use CSS and the less we use JS, the better our apps\u2019 performance will be (with a few exceptions). The reasons for that go well beyond the scope of this post.", "Another reason would be to make your UI components as universal as possible. That means using universal technologies (JS, CSS, HTML), as oppose to library/framework-specific code (for example, \u2018styled-components\u2019 or even embedding you styling in your React components).", "That\u2019s important for maintenance and scale. It\u2019s much easier to \u201ctranslate\u201d UI components from one technology stack to another when most of the styling is done using plain CSS. So, whether you\u2019re migrating your codebase to another technology stack or even creating another app using different technologies, you\u2019d find it much easier to do so when most of the styling is done using plain CSS.", "As an important side note, maintenance and scalability is also a function of using the right tools. I personally use Bit to share and organize all my UI components. That\u2019s my way of, essentially, building a design system for my team without losing precious time over that. Unlike other tools and methodologies, Bit gives you the freedom to continuously push new UI components, from any codebase to your own component collection in Bit.dev. The alternative would be to work on a whole new project (a UI library project) just to document and share UI components.", "CSS variables (and the full support that they have in all popular browsers) are something we were all looking forwards to. They\u2019re not only a solution to storing color palettes and standardized sizes (something we\u2019re used to solving by pre-processors like SASS) but they actually transform CSS from being completely static to having some sort of dynamics (something that pre-processors are not able to deliver, at least not in run-time).", "The syntax for declaring a CSS variable is quite simple: \u2014- is added to the variable name. Note that variable names are case-sensitive.", "To use a variable, wrap the variable name with var() .", "Set the custom CSS properties in their corresponding classes.", "Add the default theme class to the App component.", "Create a JS function to replace the App className.", "In the example below I\u2019ve also set my selected values to the default theme \u2018light\u2019 by using the variables to my light theme, as values.", "Below, an example CSS for a Button component. Notice how I\u2019ve set the relevant properties to --selected- and not directly to a themed value. So, for example, instead of using--dark-primary-color I\u2019m using --selected-primary-color .", "The function below collects all the --selectedCSS variables and sets their values to the new theme variables. Here, JS is used only to replace the values of one limited set of CSS variables, to another set of values.(For this to work, make sure you name your CSS properties in a consistent format).", "The key method here is the setProperty method that lets us select a CSS variable/custom property and set a new value.", "The blog for modern web and frontend development articles, tutorials, and news.
