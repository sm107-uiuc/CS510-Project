And yet, our brains hide this reality from us.", "Even with the desire to recognize the problem and the stamina to try and fix cognitive errors, there are no tools sufficiently powerful enough to get the job done.

I am riddled with cognitive biases that I can\u2019t detect, define, or fix. My brain and my five, limited senses put me in a myopic frame of reference where only I appear at the center. My belief systems force me to believe untrue facts, but I still hold onto them with a death grip. My brain spends heaps of its precious energy trying to figure out the present and dwelling on the past, but is terrible at planning for the future. I am irrational, illogical, hypercritical, and find most pleasant the information that best conforms to my worldview. My memory is faulty, and I don\u2019t even know where the gaps are. I fill in the rest with made up stories, like our eyes do with their tiny blind spots. Of the hundreds of cognitive biases and default errors I am aware of, I can\u2019t stay focused on any single one long enough to overcome them. I only imagine in terms of things I\u2019m familiar with.

After all, if we can improve our cognition, we can also improve everything downstream from it: ourselves, relationships, health, environment, religion/beliefs, politics, economics, education, security, and\u2026our individual and collective futures.", "This is really important to understand: our political systems, our economic systems, businesses, war, relationships, scientific discovery \u2014 everything \u2014 all lives downstream from our minds.", "To be clear, my suggestion of up-leveling cognition is not merely about doing what we already do better, faster. This is not about taking a performance enhancer or trying to climb the IQ charts.", "Meditation, supplements, exercise, education, self-help programs and therapy, are all useful starting points for self-improvement. The next level of improvement needs to be enabled by substantially better tools that allow us to systematically improve ourselves on known fronts and on new frontiers.", "If our cognitive potential were represented on a scale from 1\u201310, imagine that we are a 3 right now and can barely catch a glimpse of 4. What levels do we need to achieve in order to solve the problems we face?", "It may be the case that becoming perfectly logical, rational, and eliminating all blind spots is a level up, and beyond that, we need to enhance our minds by extending our sensory experiences and capabilites. To go even further, maybe we build AI so that it assumes logic/reason-based responsibilities so we can focus on higher order creativity, emotions and complexity.", "The evolutionary potential I am suggesting sits beyond our current ability to conceptualize. Just because we can\u2019t currently see it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. We are limited by our imaginations.", "When we think about AI, we imagine it as being capable of becoming and doing anything, yet, when it comes to our own potential, we\u2019re woefully unambitious and unimaginative.", "When I\u2019ve spoken about this idea, people often get confused and think that their abilities are the same as their technology, that their smartphones capabilites are their own. It\u2019s easy for that to happen.", "Upon further examination, we do not get a system upgrade every few weeks. We do not increase our native abilities by orders of magnitude every decade.

As the most generally intelligent species on planet earth, humans rule, and we do so ruthlessly.", "We decide who we eat, who we have as pets, who goes extinct and who we save. I am not suggesting that AI will behave like us \u2014 at least, I certainly hope not. And I frankly don\u2019t think we have the ability to discern how AI will evolve over the coming decades.", "Absent being able to predict the future, I am suggesting that it\u2019s urgent that we begin radically improving ourselves so that we can catch the wave of co-evolving with our digital intelligence.", "There is a window of time, which is right now, in which co-evolution needs to begin in earnest. Otherwise, we risk leaving ourselves behind, by our own design, being at the mercy of whatever AI evolutionary path lies ahead of us.", "Radically improving ourselves is also the correct response to the coming unemployment crisis.", "Right now, we\u2019re doing the exact opposite. Not only are we not urgently working to radically improve ourselves and thoughtfully co-evolve with our digital intelligence, we have built the perfect economic system to race ourselves to irrelevance. Oops. More on this in Step 3.", "Recognizing this need to radically improve ourselves was a primary reason why I started Kernel, personally seeding it with $100M. We are building next generation, non-invasive brain interfaces to accelerate our evolutionary advance.", "The future of the human race can be forecasted through a single metric: return on investment (ROI) of intelligence. Our current economic incentives (the engine that drives the world) are perfectly designed to put humans out of business and make us irrelevant as fast as possible.", "Take this example: if 100 investors were each given the option to invest $1M into improving employee skill sets at their company OR investing the $1M into a group of employees building digital intelligence (aka artificial intelligence), the vast majority would invest in digital intelligence. This is highly rational.", "The investment returns, for a large percentge of scenerios, are higher for digital. After all, it takes 33 years to produce a single human PhD! Digital intelligence, generally speaking, simply produces higher ROI than investing in humans in our current economic system, and the delta is getting larger daily.", "Regardless if you believe the rate of progress of digital intelligence is an exponential curve, punctuated equilibrium, or linear \u2014 that line is moving up and to the right. Economic returns follow. Humans, comparatively, are flatlined.", "Yes, we are capable of living in a more complex society than previous generations. We have better technology at our fingertips than any previous era. We can do things that previous generations couldn\u2019t do and we understand more about the world than any time in history.", "Still, the rate of human improvement is deminimus relative to the dynamic progress of digital intelligence.", "This is not an argument that AI is going to take over the world. I am arguing that our own, human built capitalist systems, are designed to invest money in things that create the highest returns, which is increasingly favoring digital intelligence. That means, soon, there will be little economic incentive to invest in humans.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the economic system that some of the most powerful, capable and successful companies in the world have designed. I\u2019ll create a fictitious company for example purposes called\u2026.Fakebook.", "1. Fakebook mines our digital \u201cselves,\u201d i.e. data that represents our wants, preferences, habits, proclivities, knowledge, friends, personality, etc.", "2. Fakebook sells this data to advertisers, politicians, nationstates \u2014 whomever will pay the highest price.", "3. Yay! Fakebook makes piles of money and hires the best people in the world, offering them so much money they are de-incentivized to work on solving other problems in the world (climate change, fake news, you name it.)", "4. These brilliant new hires from the best universities, build the most advanced digital tools in the world with two goals: 1) get us to use more Fakebook and 2) mine more information about us. This makes Fakebook more money, so they can hire more smart people to keep us using it more.", "5. Now that people are literally addicted to Fakebook, Fakebook can direct their attention anyway they want. People waste their precious time, become increasingly depressed, and get psychologically manipulated.", "6. Return on investment for digital intelligence increases; while return on investment for humans goes down.", "Rinse, repeat, and the cycle continues.", "So how do we create new incentives that align with human improvement? We have to change the current systems, for example:", "There are many ways we might think about shifting the incentive structures from the top down \u2014 and plenty of smart people are currently thinking about this (i.e. blockchain technologies, impact funds), but another method to consider is from the ground up.", "In taking a ground up approach, one solution would be to reclaim the value of owning our own digital data, which can then be leveraged to improve ourselves and increase our value. This way, we become an asset to be improved, not an oil well to be extracted from.", "Fakebook\u2019s business model, and market cap, assumes that a person\u2019s digital data is \u201cownerless;\u201d whoever can scrape and mine the most data about each of us (from whatever source) can do whatever they want with it. We have no say or control, can\u2019t use it to improve ourselves, and we don\u2019t financially benefit from its use.", "If there were to be a change in public tolerance or legal status around our digital data being \u201cownerless,\u201d a Data Crisis may ensue and could possibly be more consequential than the 2007 Subprime Mortgage Crisis. The second, third, and fourth order consequences following a shift in data ownership to individuals could scramble economic and political power, concentration of engineers, revenue models, social norms, and incentive structures.", "In order to encourage investment into human improvement, people need to own their digital data. Here\u2019s what that cycle of development will look like:", "The Economic System For Radical Human Improvement", "1. We digitally mine ourselves, converting everything knowable about us, into 0s and 1s. Think of it as your digital operating system. This is your property, like a house or car. This is your single most valuable asset as a human as it\u2019s the key to your self improvement and future relevance.", "2. We leverage this digital representation of ourselves to begin radical cognitive improvement.", "3. Employers pay us more for improved abilities.", "4. Other businesses make money when we improve (versus making us worse versions of ourselves). Here is how this ecosystem might emerge: Changing Our Minds One Attebyte at a Time.", "5. With our profits, we build better tools to mine and improve ourselves.", "6. Better tools = faster self and community improvement.", "In previous eras, improving oneself was a luxury. Now, it\u2019s a necessity for our survival and relevance.", "It\u2019s Time To Give AI A Hug", "Like it, love it, or fear it, AI is here and here to stay.", "While there are plenty of well-founded conversations about how we proceed in thoughtfully building AI, it\u2019s also our best co-evolutionary partner. Leveraging AI is simply the only shot we have at successfully managing complex systems such as geopolitical cooperation and conflict, resource management and our environment. Without AI, we will collapse under the complexity of our emerging world.", "More importantly, we need AI to offer us \u201cstrategically unprecedented moves\u201d.", "Looking one step further, AI is also essential in its enablement for our radical upleveling and evolution, a necessity for our future relevance and survival. AI creates a new opportunity for us to decide what is or is not worth our scarce cognitive resources.", "Imagine instead of spending years in school learning things that will be outdated by the time we graduate or will never use in life, we focus on exploring new and increasingly higher-order cognitive functions while AI takes care of the more functional aspects of society (i.e. self driving cars as a simple entry point to imagine \u2014 why would we ever waste cognitive energy driving ourselves from one place to another?).", "In Changing Our Minds One Attebyte at a Time, I explain how this new neuroeconomy might develop. If we can\u2019t get our act together and still manage to survive ourselves, it will be because AI somehow dragged us along with it.", "How we build and use AI, lives downstream from human minds, at least for now. This co-evolutionary neccessity, to simultaneously uplevel ourselves while building AI for a thriving future, cannot be overstated.", "Over the past few decades, society has built robust, swarm-like intelligence and infrastructure in digital intelligence (software and hardware). If a problem or opportunity arises in the world, or even a market need that can be addressed with digital intelligence, literally millions of talented software and hardware engineers, with cheap and powerful machines at their fingertips, leverage a vast ecosystem of tools, providers, knowledge, capital, etc. to address it instantaneously. We\u2019ve built the beginnings of global digital intelligence immune system.", "This is incredibly valuable for humanity.", "However, we do not yet have these same capabilities in biology, genetics, chemistry, or materials.", "Since you and I are built from biology, and we live on a big round ball of biology floating in space, that\u2019s problematic.", "We need robust capabilities to respond in real-time to the risks that pose the greatest risk to our continued existence.", "I\u2019ve been trying to help build this global biological immune system with my venture fund, OS Fund. In 2013, after selling my company Braintree (Venmo) to Paypal, I seeded the fund with $100M and focused on investing in the hardest of sciences: biology, materials, chemistry and genomics \u2014 technologies critical to our collective thriving and survival, yet underfunded globally relative to their importance and potential.", "Four years in, the fund performance is in the top decile among U.S. firms and of the 28 investments, we have 4 unicorns, 26 up valuations, and 2 exits.", "For more detailed explanations of what the companies are tangibly doing, plus some imagination exercises of how we might respond to certain risks (i.e. environmental), see OS Fund: Building A Global Biological Immune System.", "Work on Game Over Problems, not Horseshit Problems", "You may have heard the \u201cParable of Horseshit.\u201d In New York in the early 1900s, one hundred thousand horses produced 2.5 million pounds of horse manure per day. Horses were the primary mechanism for transportation and industry, but the smell and the public health implications of being surrounded by horse manure were untenable.", "New Yorkers were terrified. They demanded change.", "Elections were won and lost on the issue; the greatest minds of the time were focused on figuring out a solution.", "Then, in 1908, Ford rolled the Model T off the assembly line and horse manure was literally no longer a problem.

I think ABR is a \u201chorseshit problem\u201d, not because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious or real (it is), but because I think we\u2019ll eventually figure out a technical solution that solves over-farming and over-prescribing.", "The economic incentives will drive the solution to ABR \u2014 not any political, collective decision making.", "Our politics currently rely on poorly informed, irrational, illogical, and reality-distorted citizens with a myriad of competing demands (I include myself in this category) to make collective decisions about where to focus our resources.
