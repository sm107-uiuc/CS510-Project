In the beginning (of computer interfaces) was the (written) word.", "Users had to type commands manually into a machine to get anything done.", "Then, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) came along and saved the day. We became entranced by windows, mouse clicks, icons.

The system takes turns in collaborative way, and does a smart job of figuring out what the user wants.", "It was carefully crafted to deal with conversations involving VCRs, and could only operate within strict limitations.", "Modern day bots, whether they use typed or spoken input, have to face all these challenges, but also work in an efficient and scalable way on a variety of platforms.", "Basically, we\u2019re still trying to achieve the same innovations we were 30 years ago.", "Here\u2019s where I think we\u2019re going wrong:", "An oversized assumption has been that apps are \u2018over\u2019, and would be replaced by bots.", "By pitting two such disparate concepts against one another (instead of seeing them as separate entities designed to serve different purposes) we discouraged bot development.", "You might remember a similar war cry when apps first came onto the scene ten years ago: but do you remember when apps replaced the internet?", "It\u2019s said that a new product or service needs to be two of the following: better, cheaper, or faster. Are chatbots cheaper or faster than apps? No \u2014 not yet, at least.", "Whether they\u2019re \u2018better\u2019 is subjective, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that today\u2019s best bot isn\u2019t comparable to today\u2019s best app.", "Plus, nobody thinks that using Lyft is too complicated, or that it\u2019s too hard to order food or buy a dress on an app. What is too complicated is trying to complete these tasks with a bot \u2014 and having the bot fail.", "A great bot can be about as useful as an average app. When it comes to rich, sophisticated, multi-layered apps, there\u2019s no competition.", "That\u2019s because machines let us access vast and complex information systems, and the early graphical information systems were a revolutionary leap forward in helping us locate those systems.", "Modern-day apps benefit from decades of research and experimentation.

Are existing platforms able to support its functionality? Do I have the patience to build a bot that\u2019s capable of doing what I want it to?", "Another problematic aspect of the sweeping nature of hype is that it tends to bypass essential questions like these.", "For plenty of companies, bots just aren\u2019t the right solution. The past two years are littered with cases of bots being blindly applied to problems where they aren\u2019t needed.", "Building a bot for the sake of it, letting it loose and hoping for the best will never end well:", "The vast majority of bots are built using decision-tree logic, where the bot\u2019s canned response relies on spotting specific keywords in the user input.", "The advantage of this approach is that it\u2019s pretty easy to list all the cases that they are designed to cover. And that\u2019s precisely their disadvantage, too.", "That\u2019s because these bots are purely a reflection of the capability, fastidiousness and patience of the person who created them; and how many user needs and inputs they were able to anticipate.", "Problems arise when life refuses to fit into those boxes.", "According to recent reports, 70% of the 100,000+ bots on Facebook Messenger are failing to fulfil simple user requests. This is partly a result of developers failing to narrow their bot down to one strong area of focus.", "When we were building GrowthBot, we decided to make it specific to sales and marketers: not an \u2018all-rounder\u2019, despite the temptation to get overexcited about potential capabilties.", "Remember: a bot that does ONE thing well is infinitely more helpful than a bot that does multiple things poorly.", "A competent developer can build a basic bot in minutes \u2014 but one that can hold a conversation? That\u2019s another story. Despite the constant hype around AI, we\u2019re still a long way from achieving anything remotely human-like.", "In an ideal world, the technology known as NLP (natural language processing) should allow a chatbot to understand the messages it receives. But NLP is only just emerging from research labs and is very much in its infancy.", "Some platforms provide a bit of NLP, but even the best is at toddler-level capacity (for example, think about Siri understanding your words, but not their meaning.)", "As Matt Asay outlines, this results in another issue: failure to capture the attention and creativity of developers.", "\u201cConsumer interest was never going to materialize until machine intelligence could get anywhere near human intelligence.", "User interest depends upon AI that makes talking with a bot worthwhile for consumers.\u201d", "And conversations are complex. They\u2019re not linear. Topics spin around each other, take random turns, restart or abruptly finish.", "Today\u2019s rule-based dialogue systems are too brittle to deal with this kind of unpredictability, and statistical approaches using machine learning are just as limited. The level of AI required for human-like conversation just isn\u2019t available yet.", "And in the meantime, there are few high-quality examples of trailblazing bots to lead the way. As Dave Feldman remarked:", "\u201cShould Slack, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Kik, and others have built their own built-in bots to lead the way?", "Should they have gotten more proactive with their bot funds and incubators, hiring mentors to educate participants in the Way of the Bot, or supplying engineering and design resources? Funded Strategic Bot Initiatives at high-profile partners?", "In my opinion yes, yes, and yes. When it comes to platforms, developers are the users; and we don\u2019t rely on our users to understand why or how to use our products. We have to show them.\u201d", "Once upon a time, the only way to interact with computers was by typing arcane commands to the terminal. Visual interfaces using windows, icons or a mouse were a revolution in how we manipulate information", "There\u2019s a reasons computing moved from text-based to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). On the input side, it\u2019s easier and faster to click than it is to type.", "Tapping or selecting is obviously preferable to typing out a whole sentence, even with predictive (often error-prone ) text. On the output side, the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words is usually true.", "We love optical displays of information because we are highly visual creatures. It\u2019s no accident that kids love touch screens. The pioneers who dreamt up graphical interface were inspired by cognitive psychology, the study of how the brain deals with communication.", "Conversational UIs are meant to replicate the way humans prefer to communicate, but they end up requiring extra cognitive effort. Essentially, we\u2019re swapping something simple for a more-complex alternative.", "Sure, there are some concepts that we can only express using language (\u201cshow me all the ways of getting to a museum that give me 2000 steps but don\u2019t take longer than 35 minutes\u201d), but most tasks can be carried out more efficiently and intuitively with GUIs than with a conversational UI.", "Aiming for a human dimension in business interactions makes sense.", "If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s broken about sales and marketing, it\u2019s the lack of humanity: brands hide behind ticket numbers, feedback forms, do-not-reply-emails, automated responses and gated \u2018contact us\u2019 forms.", "Facebook\u2019s goal is that their bots should pass the so-called Turing Test, meaning you can\u2019t tell whether you are talking to a bot or a human. But a bot isn\u2019t the same as a human. It never will be.", "A conversation encompasses so much more than just text.", "Humans can read between the lines, leverage contextual information and understand double layers like sarcasm. Bots quickly forget what they\u2019re talking about, meaning it\u2019s a bit like conversing with someone who has little or no short-term memory.", "Bots provide a scalable way to interact one-on-one with buyers. Yet, they fail when they don\u2019t deliver an experience as efficient and delightful as the complex, multi-layered conversations people are accustomed to having with other humans on messaging apps.", "People aren\u2019t easily fooled, and pretending a bot is a human is guaranteed to diminish returns (not to mention the fact that you\u2019re lying to your users).", "And even those rare bots that are powered by state-of-the-art NLP, and excel at processing and producing content, will fall short in comparison.", "And here\u2019s the other thing. Conversational UIs are built to replicate the way humans prefer to communicate \u2014 with other humans.", "But is that how humans prefer to interact with machines?", "At the end of the day, no amount of witty quips or human-like mannerisms will save a bot from conversational failure.", "In a way, those early-adopters weren\u2019t entirely wrong.", "People are yelling at Google Home to play their favorite song, ordering pizza from the Domino\u2019s bot and getting makeup tips from Sephora. But in terms of consumer response and developer involvement, chatbots haven\u2019t lived up to the hype generated circa 2015/16.", "Computers are good at being computers. Searching for data, crunching numbers, analyzing opinions and condensing that information.", "Computers aren\u2019t good at understanding human emotion. The state of NLP means they still don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 what we\u2019re asking them, never mind how we feel.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s still impossible to imagine effective customer support, sales or marketing without the essential human touch: empathy and emotional intelligence.", "For now, bots can continue to help us with automated, repetitive, low-level tasks and queries; as cogs in a larger, more complex system. And we did them, and ourselves, a disservice by expecting so much, so soon.", "But that\u2019s not the whole story.", "Yes, our industry massively overestimated the initial impact chatbots would have. Emphasis on initial.", "We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don\u2019t let yourself be lulled into inaction.", "The hype is over. And that\u2019s a good thing. Now, we can start examining the middle-grounded grey area, instead of the hyper-inflated, frantic black and white zone.", "I believe we\u2019re at the very beginning of explosive growth. This sense of anti-climax is completely normal for transformational technology.", "Messaging will continue to gain traction. Chatbots aren\u2019t going away. NLP and AI are becoming more sophisticated every day.", "Developers, apps and platforms will continue to experiment with, and heavily invest in, conversational marketing.", "And I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.", "Get smarter at building your thing.
