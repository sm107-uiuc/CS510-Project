However, who will drive those global rules?

Have a read of this WSJ article to find out more.", "Education is a sector that is old-world in almost every respect \u2014 no technology is required to run a classroom (beyond electricity \u2014 nearly free in the 2020s???- and paper and pencils); it is extremely labour intensive and that labour (teachers) is highly qualified and expensive to educate. Lastly, students learn better when they are together \u2014 hence, physical proximity is still important.", "But it is changing. And demand for education is growing at the same time.", "Whether virtual learning environments will extend beyond tech / software subjects is hard to predict. I suspect that there will be limited appetite but that won\u2019t stop home schooling and a more decentralised way of learning where \u2018influencer teachers\u2019 join a classroom to teach a favourite subject. For instance, just imagine David Attenborough (well, a virtual representation of him at least) turning up in your classroom when you were learning biology? Think you might have learnt a bit more? Me? Certainly!", "In the 2020s education demand will grow for the over 70s as learning new stuff features at the top of local government\u2019s anti-loneliness and anti-dementia policy. Learning new stuff gets you smart and keeps you smart \u2014 it will be essential for both ends of the age scale.", "It may be that the \u2018new stuff\u2019 needs to lead directly to employment activity too \u2014 as that is where much of the \u2018real world\u2019 learning will take place.", "In fact, we will see education move beyond the classroom and into a \u2018doing\u2019 or apprentice type context \u2014 just don\u2019t be surprised if your apprentice is 50 years older than the teacher and that after lunch, they swap roles.", "Lastly, the half-life of a practical subject \u2014 like law or medicine \u2014 has been decreasing rapidly \u2014 such that every 5 or so years, experienced practitioners will need to go for substantial re-fresh. This maybe where virtual learning has the greatest success, as it enables updates whilst taking the least amount of time and therefore allows the student to continue to earn a living.", "Health has always been a high-tech sector \u2014 but it is undergoing unprecedented change as investment is made into bio-tech. Some highly successful tech investors (eg. Andreessen Horowitz) are convinced that bio-tech is like software in the 1990s \u2014 developed, but tiny in comparison to its potential and therefore, this is the sector most likely to receive trillions of investment dollars and hence, most like to change out of all recognition in the next 10 years.

Well, perhaps not, because truth and untruth are fluid concepts whereas stuff \u2014 like cars, software developers, flights, homes, shoes \u2014 that\u2019s stuff and can be found (sorry software developers \u2014 I mean, find your skills \u2014 not you as people).", "In addition, Artificial Intelligence can find pathways too \u2014 so, the route to winning a chess game or a game of GO is to find the pathway most likely to bring you to a successful outcome \u2014 recalculated each time it is your turn. As it happens, computers are brilliant and discovering these sorts of pathways.", "Computers will also detect cancer earlier and bring exceptional levels of diagnostics to our medical examinations \u2014 which will in turn, increase the demand for more examinations and more data and faster updates / responses to that data \u2014 which is going to place new demand on medical staff as once you have a diagnosis and there are two or three options, you\u2019re going to want to talk this through with a human.", "So, don\u2019t expect AI to replace jobs \u2014 displace jobs, yes \u2014 but oddly, the areas where AI has the greatest potential impact in the 2020s \u2014 medical services \u2014 will also stimulate new demand and existing jobs will move or be displaced to meet that new demand.", "Can AI be used to find a path through streets? In other words, will AI be able to drive our cars? No and maybe!", "Rather than seeing millions of drones delivering Amazon parcels \u2013drones for surveillance, for disrupting flights, for policing and military purposes \u2014 will be the drone stories of the 2020s.", "Forecasts for 2027 suggest that US home deliveries by drone will reach a market value of just $29bn against a total home delivery market value of $400bn (source: marketwatch). Rather than this representing just 1/16th of the whole market, it is more likely that drone delivery will be well advanced but only in a few cities or towns.", "Which towns and cities adopt drone delivery will be determined by local politics and, perhaps, whether issues of congestion and terrain make drones more attractive.", "Home delivery by drone will follow a similar path to autonomous vehicles \u2014 where local towns and cities allow it, it will be possible. But will you and I want to live in those cities?", "Drones will of course have a special value in certain industries \u2014 building or industrial plant surveillance and maintenance as well as wildlife filming and movie making, all of which will reduce cost and, in the case of filming, increase supply. A YouTube for wildlife videos, anyone?", "Or perhaps a drone will become the new \u2018must have\u2019 for social media influencers? Will Facebook servers be able to cope?", "The 2020s will be characterised by the feeling that everything is and can be measured \u2014 our heart rates, our blood sugar levels, our sleep patterns, our urine will be sampled on a daily basis and our food calories too.", "However, this might only appeal to a niche audience. Many people will just say, what the heck! \u2014 who wants an \u2018optimised\u2019 life if I\u2019m not allowed a beer once in a while (or perhaps more often).", "The failure of Smart Watches to reach beyond a niche is a good warning that we don\u2019t want tech to manage everything \u2014 sometimes, we just don\u2019t want to know \u2014 especially if it is good for us!", "Last decade featured battles over US tech giants seeking and then losing influence in China (eg. Google) just as China has built its own tech giants and now seeks to open up markets beyond China.", "And these spats and issues will continue until 2030.", "However, there is a new player in the 2020s version of the Splinternet and that is the Hispanic world.", "After English, Spanish is the most common second language on the planet.", "Not only does it have huge impact on North America \u2014 through central America, Mexico and Spanish speakers in the USA, but is also operates across South America bar Brazil and a couple of small exceptions.", "The Hispanic world is, unlike the Anglo-Saxon world, still culturally focused on the mother country \u2014 Spain! Most people in South and Central American can trace lineage and cultural connections back to Spain \u2014 for instance, the tradition of celebrating the arrival of the three kings on the 6th of January is largely a Spanish and Mexican tradition.", "This matters because it cements Spain\u2019s position as the gateway to BOTH the EU and also Latin / Central America (and beyond into Spanish speaking USA itself).", "Once the UK removes itself from the EU, it will no longer be the go-to destination for US tech companies moving abroad \u2014 Spain will take the place of the UK. Yes, Ireland will play a part, but it is too small to host the breadth of tech and engineering skills that will be needed.", "As such, the Hispanic internet will see strong investment and the hub will be Spanish cities in the 2020s.", "The 2020s will end the binary division between USA and China as Spanish becomes the third part of the digital world.", "What could stop this three-language vision of the internet happening in the 2020s? Well, Spanish politics for a start \u2014 but 10 years is long enough for Spain to get its act together and, when an idea\u2019s time has come, nothing can stop it, not even all the armies in the world (adapted from Victor Hugo).", "The technology to do many things we might be able to imagine will exist by the end of the 2020s. Whether the technology is allowed to be deployed or how it operates will depend less on the tech world and more on the political world and of course, customer response.", "The business models, privacy and ethical frameworks will need to be designed, built and adapted to allow new technologies to emerge and establish themselves.", "Therefore, the pre-eminent political power in the 2020s will lie with those that legislate over the largest markets.", "The experience of the EU\u2019s GDPR (data and privacy rules) are that the European highest standards, quickly become global standards. Tax law changes will also effect how tech companies deploy globally and on this issue, the US Presidential policy will impact the decisions of US tech companies.", "However, this bigger issue is that the EU is likely to have as high or higher technological standards and greater interest in social and political frameworks for the emerging technologies than the USA, and hence this block will be the dominant political body for the next decade.", "The EU parliament has already set global standards for data use and privacy. It is significant that the exit of Britain in 2020 doesn\u2019t stop anti-EU politicians threatening to sue the British government for data breaches using EU inspired law (source: The Independent).", "Equally, any tech company with a goal to operate globally, will find that its servers hold data on people who either are living in the EU or non-EU citizens who have passed through the EU and therefore, they must comply or face potential fines.", "The EU \u2014 and EU parliament, is therefore setting the highest data and privacy standards and any tech or digital company that is more than a local agency, will need to meet those standards.", "Equally, European cities are those with both the greatest need to remove the car from their centres (as medieval layouts are not suited to heavy traffic) and the politics (at local and EU level) to ban diesel and petrol cars is powerful, thus spurring the adoption of electric vehicles, driving this innovation.", "Expect therefore the changes in new drug testing and adoption to be first tested in law at the EU level. And the legal framework for non-driver autonomous vehicles will have to be set at EU level and so on and so forth.", "Equally, the digital tax on tech giants will come from coordinated action across the EU and no doubt through the EU parliament too.", "Hence, even if Silicon Valley can invent new tech, its commercial success will require compliance with EU law. This will happen regardless of who sits in the White House or what kind of promises a Brexit Prime Minister makes in Britain.", "It is also possible that the next holder of the keys to the White House will exert some pressure too \u2014 but depending on the nature of those incumbents it might simply be restricted to adjustments to the tax code to force US tech companies to onshore profits and IP (source: FT)", "In the meantime, smart news organisations will be taking half their international bureau budgets and using them to expand their reporting teams in Brussels in the 2020s.", "Above all else, this is the decade where technology and politics cooperate\u2014 or collide. Expect squeals and yelps from West Coast libertarians, but most people will recognise the value and need of a more grown up approach to technology.", "We\u2019ve had the dark social media adverts influencing our politics. We\u2019ve seen our health systems brought to its knees (temporarily) by cyberattacks and we\u2019ve experienced the drama and emotionally numbing effect of VAR technology in that European export success, football.", "Our planet faces a number of potentially existential threats \u2014 eg. climate change \u2014 that will drive technology development in transport, consumption and energy. But this time, the politics will be driving the change, not just the market or consumer.", "Success in the 2020s will depend on the ability to combine both great technology and user experience with effective engagement with the politics and political issues of the day.", "No wo(man) is an Island! We really are in this together!", "I hope this has been helpful, interesting and stimulating!", "And above all, have an amazing year and an incredible decade.", "I\u2019m Neil Lewis \u2014 a \u2018Got the T Shirt\u2019 Scaleup Coach at Media Modo and I coach startups to scaleup.
