In 2018, it was reported that Americans spent on average 97 hours a year in traffic congestion, costing the economy over $80 billion (INRIX). Despite the rise of alternate transportation methods such as publicly funded transit networks, major cities including Chicago and Atlanta have seen traffic get worse year over year.", "It is crazy to think that up to this point, solutions for the transit crisis have been limited to subway systems, passenger trains, or bike lanes. How can we expect exceptional change with such mediocre and uninspiring solutions?", "In California, a massively expensive $77 billion high speed rail (HSR) project is underway with the goal of being the future of effective transportation. One thing for sure is that it won\u2019t be the near future\u2026 with completion expected to be longer than a decade. On top of the hefty price tag and marathon to completion, the HSR is merely an incremental improvement to the preexisting rail system and won\u2019t likely lead to unprecedented change.", "To combat the lack of innovation in regional transit options, Elon Musk has proposed an alternative named Hyperloop Alpha, as the future of transportation. How much can it truly help? Let's find out.", "Hyperloop is a concept in which pods travel though a low pressure tube at subsonic speeds (slightly slower than sound), mitigating friction and air resistance to increase speed and efficiency.", "Musk has proposed this system as an alternative to the San Francisco \u2014 Los Angeles HSR, and can travel at proposed speeds of up to 760mph (compared to 220mph for HSR). Hyperloop\u2019s maximum efficiency threshold is roughly 500 miles, at which air would be a faster alternative past that range. Estimates project an annual capacity of around 7.5 million passengers, with a ticket price of $20 per passenger.", "The best part, the price tag for the project is a mere $6 billion. Less than 10% the cost of the HSR project.", "The cost of the Hyperloop system contains two key facets: capsule construction and tube construction.", "The 40 capsules that are expected for the LA-SF project are projected to cost a total of $54 million. The pods consist of three technical components, including a compressor, batteries, and suspension, that all drive up the price.", "Contained in a steel tube, the compressor consumes air that is ahead of the moving capsule, and redirects it to the suspension where the air creates a cushion that allows the vehicle to levitate.", "On the other side, totalling roughly $5.5 billion, the tube component of Hyperloop is the greatest cost driver of the project.", "Due to the scale of this project, the size is reflected in the price tag. Namely, the 25,000 concrete \u201cpylons\u201d that support the tube are projected to cost a total of $2.5 billion. Other notable costs include $650 million for the tube, $600 million for tunnels, and around $1 billion for land acquisition.", "When compared to HSR, Hyperloop is projected to be less than a tenth of the cost. How could it be that such a new technology is an entire order of magnitude cheaper than the status quo?", "The answer: land efficiency and prefabricated construction.", "Land prices are a large contributor to the discrepancy between HSR and Hyperloop costs. HSR demands a continuous strip of tracks, which consumes significant land, and may also act as a barrier that could literally divide property that people own. These two factors combined equate to a steep land price for HSR.", "Conversely, the Hyperloop tunnel does not run on the ground, but rather on pylons that are 100ft apart. Not only do these pylons have a very small footprint that demand less land, but they only cause a minor inconvenience for land owners and can easy be worked around.", "Looking at construction processes, less onsite construction generally equates to a cheaper project. This concept is leveraged in the Hyperloop project, as all the infrastructure components are prefabricated offsite and simply need to be placed and installed onsite. Namely, the 25000 pylons are all mass produced offsite, maximizing economies of scale, and are brought to the site already prepared for installation. All that needs to be done onsite is to install them in predetermined locations.", "HSR takes the opposite approach, in which the majority of construction occurs onsite. Despite having some components such as the rails or the rail bases being produced offsite, the fabrication and construction occurs almost entirely onsite. This increases the amount of labour required and timelines, both contributing to increased costs.", "Originally considered an afterthought to the passenger Hyperloop concept, the idea of transporting freight has begun to grow in popularity. As a proof of concept for the unproven Hyperloop idea, the cargo option would pose less risk to potential passengers, and could act as a steppingstone for the integration of a passenger Hyperloop. It also has the potential to get cargo off the road networks, improving traffic flows.", "Hyperloop would be competing against the four traditional cargo transportation mediums: air, train, truck, and sea. However, due to the nature of Hyperloop, it would be unlikely that it could substantially disrupt any of these markets.", "Despite the interesting prospect of a freight Hyperloop system, it seems unlikely to hold any significance in the market.", "Hyperloop is a step in the right direction when it comes to clean transportation. Running entirely on solar power, Hyperloop creates zero emissions while in use.", "Over $200 million of solar panels would be required and would be placed along the top of the tube. The energy would then be conveniently stored in batteries in the capsules for easy access.", "Unlike many places around the globe, California is fortunate enough to have a climate that supports viable solar power. However, it is unlikely that Hyperloop could be powered entirely by integrated solar in many other areas.", "To solve this problem, either more money would need to be spent on external solar panels; otherwise, Hyperloop would need to tap into the local electricity system that is likely powered by fossil fuels.", "When it comes to the future of transportation, Elon Musk has the right approach. With all of his transportation ventures, he identifies a problem with the status quo, brings the cost down an unprecedented amount, and also improves on the existing technology in the process. The success of this process has been proven with SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. The same goes for Hyperloop.", "However, let\u2019s really think about it. What problem does Hyperloop really solve? Certainly not rush hour congestion. There is simply a lack of versatile uses for the system.", "By connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco via Hyperloop, perhaps there will be more travel between the two cities, but it\u2019s not like people are frequently taking that six hour drive in the first place.", "In fact, I see no reason why there is value in having a HSR system in place either. The resources are being put in the WRONG places. Neither solution actually tackles the REAL PROBLEM of rush hour congestion. The only problem Hyperloop solves is that it\u2019s better than HSR for an issue that is practically irrelevant.", "Here\u2019s how I see it. The innovation put into Hyperloop is the spark needed to trail-blaze a new transportation medium, but I don\u2019t think the effort is being put into the right areas.", "Moving forward, I do see Hyperloop becoming one of many pillars in a revolutionized transit network, but it is far from the saving grace we currently need. For connecting cities to one another, Hyperloop is the solution, but in terms of commuter traffic, there is not much of a future for this system.", "Perhaps this is all part of Elon Musk\u2019s secret master transportation plan: Tesla is for local endeavours, Hyperloop is for regional connections, and SpaceX handles international and interplanetary travel.", "One piece in the overall puzzle of the future of transportation, Hyperloop only fits in once there is a transit network that is able to compliment it. Maybe once Musk gets his vision up and running, Hyperloop will find its place. Hyperloop is by no means be a fad, but only time can tell when it may become the future.", "Get smarter at building your thing.
