I\u2019ve listened to a bunch of machine learning and data science podcasts in the last few months, so I thought I\u2019d share my favorites:", "A great starting point on some of the basics of data science and machine learning. Every other week, they release a 10\u201315 minute episode where hosts, Kyle and Linda Polich give a short primer on topics like k-means clustering, natural language processing and decision tree learning, often using analogies related to their pet parrot, Yoshi. This is the only place where you\u2019ll learn about k-means clustering via placement of parrot droppings.", "Hosted by Katie Malone and Ben Jaffe of online education startup Udacity, this weekly podcast covers diverse topics in data science and machine learning: teaching specific concepts like Hidden Markov Models and how they apply to real-world problems and datasets. They make complex topics extremely accessible.", "Each week, hosts Chris Albon and Jonathon Morgan, both experienced technologists and data scientists, talk about the latest news in data science over drinks. Listening to Partially Derivative is a great way to keep up on the latest data news.", "This podcast features Ben Lorica, O\u2019Reilly Media\u2019s Chief Data Scientist speaking with other experts about timely big data and data science topics. It can often get quite technical, but the topics of discussion are always really interesting.", "Data Stories is a little more focused on data visualization than data science, but there is often some interesting overlap between the topics. Every other week, Enrico Bertini and Moritz Stefaner cover diverse topics in data with their guests. Recent episodes about smart cities and Nicholas Felton\u2019s annual reports are particularly interesting.", "Billing itself as \u201cA Gentle Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\u201d, this podcast can still get quite technical and complex, covering topics like: \u201cHow to Reason About Uncertain Events using Fuzzy Set Theory and Fuzzy Measure Theory\u201d and \u201cHow to Represent Knowledge using Logical Rules\u201d.", "The newest podcasts on this list, with 8 episodes released as of this writing. Every other week, hosts Katherine Gorman and Ryan Adams speak with a guest about their work, and news stories related to machine learning.", "Feel I\u2019ve unfairly left a podcast off this list? Leave me a note to let me know.", "Published in Startups, Wanderlust, and Life Hacking", "Get smarter at building your thing.
