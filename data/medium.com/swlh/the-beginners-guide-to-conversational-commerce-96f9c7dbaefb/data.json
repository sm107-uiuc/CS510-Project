A buzzword, a footnote, a revelation. Everyone\u2019s talking about it, but what is it?", "At its most simple, it\u2019s the act of talking \u2014 and more importantly, listening \u2014 to your customers: their problems, their stories, their successes. Forging a genuine connection and using that connection to inform your marketing decisions.", "At its most complex, conversational marketing has become synonymous with cutting-edge technologies for computer-based dialog processing.", "Brands have always known that one-to-one conversations are valuable; but up until very recently, it was impossible to personalize these conversations at scale, in real-time.", "No longer. Chatbots have become a mainstay of digital marketing, and every day their underlying AI becomes more sophisticated. Gartner predicts that by 2020, 30% of our interactions with technology will be through \u201cconversations\u201d with smart machines.", "In his 1999 Cluetrain Manifesto, David Weinberger reminded us that", "\u201cMarkets are nothing more than conversations\u201d;", "that\u2019s a hundred times more true today.", "A successful conversational marketing strategy will pair the spark of authenticity from real conversation with the emerging technologies of the future.", "In a 2016 article, Chris Messina distills the concept:", "\u201cConversational commerce (as I see it) largely pertains to utilizing chat, messaging, or other natural language interfaces (i.e., voice) to interact with people, brands, or services and bots that heretofore have had no real place in the bidirectional, asynchronous messaging context.\u201d", "Conversational converse is the process of having a real-time, one-to-one conversation with a customer or lead. It\u2019s a direct, personalized, dialog-driven approach to nurturing long-term relationships, collecting data and increasing sales.", "Unlike traditional digital marketing, it \u2018pulls\u2019 users in instead of \u2018pushing\u2019 content on them. It\u2019s a discourse, not a lecture.", "Despite recently picking up speed, conversational marketing isn\u2019t new.", "The concept made its first appearance in 2007 with Joseph Jaffe\u2019s Join the Conversation. Jaffe wanted to teach marketers to re-engage their customers through community, partnership, and dialog:", "\u201cThere are literally millions of alive, flawed, human, passionate, influential and authentic conversations going on around you right now: isn\u2019t it time you joined in? Through the power of community, dialogue and partnership, marketing can be a conversation; a welcome guest in the homes, experiences and lives of our consumers.\u201d", "In the past, brands have been able to talk at their customers \u2014 through email, website interactions and social media \u2014 not with them.", "Brands have struggled to capture, keep and convert attention into sales, sign-ups, and long-term loyalty. Engagement was passive, and results were shallow.", "Customer service was relegated to a formulaic question-answer scenario that was unsatisfying for everyone involved. Take it from leading conversational marketing platform Drift\u2019s stellar report:", "\u201c[\u2026] the buying experience most companies provide has become cold and impersonal. For many marketing and sales teams, their leads have become faceless entities that exist only inside of spreadsheets \u2014 they aren\u2019t treated like actual people. At some point, being data-driven started being more important than being customer-driven.\u201d", "Cold call conversion rates are plummeting. Cold emails have a 1% open rate.", "81% of tech buyers who encounter gated content don\u2019t fill out the form.", "But the open rate for a private message? 92%.", "Today, messaging apps have over 5 billion monthly active users, and for the first time, usage rates have surpassed social networks. Whether it\u2019s chatting with friends on WhatsApp or exchanging ideas with coworkers on Slack, messaging has become an integral part of our lives.", "Despite extreme app saturation, the average person only uses five apps regularly and, you guessed it \u2014 messaging apps claim these spots, boasting 10x better open rates than the next leading digital channel. These messaging platforms have huge audiences: there are over 4 billion active monthly users on the top three messaging apps.", "Like the rise of the internet or the app economy of the past decade, conversational marketing is born from current desires: for real-time connection and genuine value.", "Conversational marketing is an umbrella term that encompasses every dialog-driven tactic, from opt-in email marketing to customer feedback.", "But the engine powering recent developments is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Chatbots represent the new era in conversational marketing: scaleable, personalized, real-time and data-driven.", "Of course, these bots aren\u2019t intended to replace human-to-human interactions; they\u2019re there to support and enhance them: helping users have the right conversations with the right people at the right time.", "(For the meantime, anyway. According to Gartner research, chatbots will account for 85% of all customer service by 2020).", "Chatbots are a blank canvas, with the potential to be molded and infused with a persona that reflects a company\u2019s values \u2014 like our very own GrowthBot(AKA a mini Dharmesh Shah).", "This technology is still in its infancy, so most bots follow a set of rules programmed by a human via a bot-building platform. The differentiator is that the chatbots carry out conversations with users using natural language.", "AI uses first-person data to learn more about each customer and deliver a hyper-personalized experience. Reps and bots can then join forces to manage these conversations at scale.", "Let\u2019s imagine I\u2019m going to a fancy party. Tonight. It\u2019s last minute, and I\u2019ve just received a message that it\u2019s black tie; but I don\u2019t have the right shoes. I need to quickly find a pair that is appropriate; my size; coherent with the rest of my outfit; a good price, etc.", "I would usually Google for a shop in my area, then go to browse on their website to find a pair I like. But other issues would soon crop up: do they have my size? Are the shoes smart enough? Are they in stock?", "I could fill out a query on the site\u2019s contact form, or give them a ring, but will they answer? And if they don\u2019t have the right pair, they are unlikely to suggest a range of alternatives. The whole process is time-consuming and inefficient.", "But suppose the brand I like has a strong conversational marketing culture. Instead of resorting to email, I would be able to conduct the conversation in seconds on my phone; instantly, I\u2019m given the colours, sizes and styles in stock. I can pay for the right shoes with a tap of a button.", "Conversational marketing enables users to get the information they need instantly, without picking up the phone or engaging with a person. It\u2019s not about laziness; it\u2019s about ease.", "\u201cInnovative brands are realizing that messaging offers the kind of convenience that drives engagement \u2014 and the kind of intimacy that inspires deep customer loyalty.\u201d", "As Clara de Soto, cofounder of Reply.ai, told VentureBeat,", "\u201cYou\u2019re never just \u2018building a bot\u2019 so much as launching a \u2018conversational strategy\u2019 \u2014 one that\u2019s constantly evolving and being optimized based on how users are actually interacting with it.\u201d", "If users are made to toggle between various apps and platforms to get the answer they need, the value of the bot is moot: it needs to be native to the place they spend most time, whether that\u2019s Slack, Messenger or onsite chat.", "But it can be tricky for brands to consolidate all their conversations in one place. That\u2019s why HubSpot created Conversations, a free, multi-channel tool that lets businesses have one-to-one conversations at scale.", "\u201cWhether it\u2019s between two humans, or a human and a bot, one-to-one messaging is the future of communications. Messages are simpler, smarter, and truly essential for creating an amazing customer experience.", "With Conversations, we\u2019re going beyond a single solution, like site chat, to build something that centralizes all of a business\u2019s communications with customers and prospects into one, collaborative environment.\u201d", "says Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot.", "\u201cThis is the double-edged sword of messaging. Bots provide a scalable way to interact one-on-one with buyers. Yet they fail when they don\u2019t deliver an experience as efficient and delightful as the complex, multi-layered conversations people are accustomed to having with other humans on messaging apps.\u201d", "We have a much lower tolerance for mistakes with machines compared to humans: 73% of people say they won\u2019t interact with a bot again after one negative experience. And if a bot seems to be able to converse in English, we tend to easily overestimate how capable it is.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to manage your customers\u2019 expectations appropriately. Bots are far from being autonomous, and people aren\u2019t easily fooled; trying to present your bot as a human agent is likely to be self-defeating. Bots don\u2019t understand context created by preceding text, and conversational nuances can easily affect their capacity to answer.", "User: When is next flight to Chicago?", "User: What time does it arrive?", "Because bots live inside messaging apps, they have the potential to invade a highly personal space, making the stakes of getting it right much higher.", "According to research, people use messaging apps for customer assistance with one key goal: to get their problem solved, fast. Bots should serve one simple purpose well, without getting tangled up in the conversational complications that are better left to humans.", "The way brands and users interract is undergoing a monumental shift. Customers are smarter and better-informed than ever before. They expect personalization and transparency as a prerequisite. They feel empowered by their options. It\u2019s hard to fool them, and even harder to gain their loyalty.", "And most significantly, they want 24/7, 365 days of the year instantaneousness: to be heard, to be helped, right now; not in half an hour, not tomorrow. That\u2019s why conversational marketing represents a new cornerstone in marketing but also in customer service and experience, branding and sales.", "Building a bot for the sake of being on-trend is not enough; it needs to be part of a larger strategy where each conversation has a purpose. As a long-term strategy intended to facilitate lasting relationships, it needs to be spearheaded towards a long-term goal.", "Effective conversational marketing is an intersection of brand values, user engagement and valuable dialogue. It\u2019s about building your audience first, selling last.", "If you enjoyed this article, feel free to hit that clap button \ud83d\udc4f to help others find it.", "Get smarter at building your thing.
