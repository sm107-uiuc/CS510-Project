Each year, this competition gives data scientists a chance to use their passion to change the world. Over the last four years, more than 50,000+ competitors have submitted over 114,000+ submissions, to improve everything from lung cancer and heart disease detection to ocean health. This year, competitors were challenged to identify the factors that matter most to predicting player capability in an educational kid\u2019s game by PBS. For more information on the Data Science Bowl, please visit DataScienceBowl.com", "Sanghoon: Well, I currently work as a data scientist at eBay Korea. I\u2019m very interested in computer vision and natural language processing. My main interest these days has been to exceed the performance of LightGBM and XGBoost, with deep neural networks in most tabular data. In particular, I enjoys less focus on feature engineering and more focus on model architect design.", "Sanghoon: I\u2019ve been working in computer vision (especially face recognition) and natural language processing for about 10 years. I also majored in electronics, so I learned calculus, probability statistics, and linear algebra in my undergraduate course. Although I don\u2019t really remember if I retained anything \ud83d\ude09. In the past five years, I\u2018ve been dealing with e-commerce data that consists of images, text, and tabular data.", "On the Kaggle-front, I participated in my first competition in February 2019 and here I am!", "First, my experience with feature engineering to use tabular data as input to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) was really helpful.", "Second, my experience of dealing with Transformer models in the Predicting Molecular Properties competition.", "S: Working in the e-commerce field, you\u2019re exposed to a lot of tabular data. However, I was mostly working with computer vision and natural language processing and was not familiar with how to deal with tabular data. I decided to compete in Kaggle because there were a lot of competitions using tabular data, and I could learn how to work with it.", "S: To be quite frank, the prize money had the biggest impact on my participation. \ud83d\ude0a", "S: Transformer model is a model that is being used successfully in natural language processing. In particular, Transformer-based BERT is the latest technology in natural language processing.", "Recently, we were inspired by this and were trying to apply the Transformer in other fields. The top three teams of the recent Predicting Molecular Properties competition all used Transformer.", "S: The figure above shows the log of one user (installation_id) on the app. A total of 17,000 user log data are provided for training.", "The objective of this competition is to look at a user\u2019s past records and predict the value of this user\u2019s accuracy_group.", "Aggregation by game_session.I treated the log data as sequence data because it was recorded in chronological order. Models for dealing with sequence data include LSTM and Transformer, which are being successfully used by NLP. However, you cannot use infinitely long sequences because of the model\u2019s performance and resource problems.", "Therefore, in the case of user (installation_id), the log data at times had to be reduced since it was close to 58,000.", "The code below is an example of the code used for aggregation:", "As shown in the figure below, the length of game_sessions is reduced to 1, which dramatically reduces the length of one installation_id.", "S: The TRANSFORMER ModelFor more information on the Transformer model, refer to the \u201cAttention Is All You Need\u201d paper or a well-organized blog on the Internet.", "I only want to introduce the features of the Transformer model required in this competition.", "The Transformer model has been used successfully in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. One of its important features is being able to encode a continuous sequence like [A, B, C, \u2026, Z] into one vector.", "Note that in NLP, the whole [A, B, C, \u2026, Z] sequence can be considered to correspond to one sentence, and each alphabet corresponds to each word of a sentence.", "The Transformer (TR) can be stacked in multiple layers to encode more abstract information. The figure below shows an example of adding only one layer.", "Transformer applied at the 2019 DSBThe input of the Transformer in NLP is a sentence consisting of several words.", "Similarly, the input of TRANSFORMER for DSB can be considered as an installation_id consisting of multiple games_session.", "The figure below shows a block of a Transformer model that receives an installation_id, compresses the information, delivers it to the Regression Layer, and predicts the accuracy_group in the Regression Layer.", "Creating an embedding from game_sessionThere are two types of tabular data: categorical and continuous. The processing method varies depending on the type of column of the tabular data.", "If the column is a categorical type: Embed using the embedding layer and concatenate all of them to obtain a cate_emb vector. For the cate_emb vector, modules made with a linear layer can be used for dimension reduction as shown below, since the size of the dimension is large.", "If the column is a continuous type: The cont_emb vector is obtained by using the linear layer directly; the following modules are used.", "Creating a joint embeddingConcatenate the cate_emb vector and cont_emb.", "Predicting pred_yObtain the sequence_output by inputting seq_emb as obtained previously into self.encoder, an instance of the Transformer model as shown in the figure above. Then you can obtain pred_y, the prediction of accuracy_group, through self.reg_layer.", "For more information, please refer to this disclosed code.", "S: One-quarter of the time was invested in feature engineering, half of the time in model architecture design, and another quarter of the time in tuning model parameters.", "S: Most of the participants in the competition appeared to have used the tree-based model. Meanwhile demonstrated that just using neural networks alone could take me to the top.", "In particular, I was pleased with being able to refine my skills in embedding categorical and continuous data in this competition.", "S: I regret that I wasn\u2019t able to use the game time interval, more specifically the time interval between each game_session, as a feature. It wasa feature used by another competitor, and it looks quite useful.", "S: Kaggle has a lot of quality resources. It\u2019s always very useful to view the notebook that received the most votes on the notebook tab. Also, the methodology obtained from Kaggle is very practical, so it is applicable even at work!", "If you liked this interview, show Sanghoon some\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f!", "Take a look at most recent competitions at: kaggle.com/competitions", "Official Kaggle Blog ft. interviews from top data science competitors and more!", "Official authors of Kaggle winner\u2019s interviews + more!
