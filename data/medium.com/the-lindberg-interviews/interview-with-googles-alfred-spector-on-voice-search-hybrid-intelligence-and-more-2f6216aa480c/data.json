Well, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. VP of research Alfred Spector talks to Oliver Lindberg about the technologies emerging from Google Labs \u2014 from voice search to hybrid intelligence and beyond", "This article originally appeared in issue 198 of .net magazine in 2010 and was republished at www.techradar.com.", "Google has always been tight-lipped about products that haven\u2019t launched yet. It\u2019s no secret, however, that thanks to the company\u2019s bottom-up culture, its engineers are working on tons of new projects at the same time. Following the mantra of \u2018release early, release often\u2019, the speed at which the search engine giant is churning out tools is staggering. At the heart of it all is Alfred Spector, Google\u2019s Vice President of Research and Special Initiatives.", "One of the areas Google is making significant advances in is voice search. Spector is astounded by how rapidly it\u2019s come along. The Google Mobile App features \u2018search by voice\u2019 capabilities that are available for the iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Android. All versions understand English (including US, UK, Australian and Indian-English accents) but the latest addition, for Nokia S60 phones, even introduces Mandarin speech recognition, which \u2014 because of its many different accents and tonal characteristics \u2014 posed a huge engineering challenge. It\u2019s the most spoken language in the world, but as it isn\u2019t exactly keyboard-friendly, voice search could become immensely popular in China.", "\u201cVoice is one of these grand technology challenges in computer science,\u201d Spector explains. \u201cCan a computer understand the human voice? It\u2019s been worked on for many decades and what we\u2019ve realised over the last couple of years is that search, particularly on handheld devices, is amenable to voice as an import mechanism. \u201cIt\u2019s very valuable to be able to use voice. All of us know that no matter how good the keyboard, it\u2019s tricky to type exactly the right thing into a searchbar, while holding your backpack and everything else.\u201d", "To get a computer to take account of your voice is no mean feat, of course. \u201cOne idea is to take all of the voices that the system hears over time into one huge pan-human voice model. So, on the one hand we have a voice that\u2019s higher and with an English accent, and on the other hand my voice, which is deeper and with an American accent. They both go into one model, or it just becomes personalised to the individual; voice scientists are a little unclear as to which is the best approach.\u201d", "The research department is also making progress in machine translation. Google Translate already features 51 languages, including Swahili and Yiddish. The latest version introduces instant, real-time translation, phonetic input and text-to-speech support (in English). \u201cWe\u2019re able to go from any language to any of the others, and there are 51 times 50, so 2,550 possibilities,\u201d Spector explains. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on increasing the number of languages because we\u2019d like to handle even those languages where there\u2019s not an enormous volume of usage. It will make the web far more valuable to more people if they can access the English-or Chinese language web, for example.", "\u201cBut we also continue to focus on quality because almost always the translations are valuable but imperfect. Sometimes it comes from training our translation system over more raw data, so we have, say, EU documents in English and French and can compare them and learn rules for translation. The other approach is to bring more knowledge into translation. For example, we\u2019re using more syntactic knowledge today and doing automated parsing with language. It\u2019s been a grand challenge of the field since the late 1950s. Now it\u2019s finally achieved mass usage.\u201d", "The team, led by scientist Franz Josef Och, has been collecting data for more than 100 languages, and the Google Translator Toolkit, which makes use of the \u2018wisdom of the crowds\u2019, now even supports 345 languages, many of which are minority languages. The editor enables users to translate text, correct the automatic translation and publish it.", "Spector thinks that this approach is the future. As computers become even faster, handling more and more data \u2014 a lot of it in the cloud \u2014 machines learn from users and thus become smarter. He calls this concept \u2018hybrid intelligence\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to solve these technological problems without human input,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to create a robot that\u2019s as clever, smart and knowledgeable of the world as we humans are. But it\u2019s not as tough to build a computational system like Google, which extends what we do greatly and gradually learns something about the world from us, but that requires our interpretation to make it really successful. \u201cWe need to get computers and people communicating in both directions, so the computer learns from the human and makes the human more effective.\u201d", "Examples of \u2018hybrid intelligence\u2019 are Google Suggest, which instantly offers popular searches as you type a search query, and the \u2018did you mean?\u2019 feature in Google search, which corrects you when you misspell a query in the search bar. The more you use it, the better the system gets.", "Training computers to become seemingly more intelligent poses major hurdles for Google\u2019s engineers. \u201cComputers don\u2019t train as efficiently as people do,\u201d Spector explains. \u201cLet\u2019s take the chess example. If a Kasparov was the educator, we could count on almost anything he says as being accurate. But if you tried to learn from a million chess players, you learn from my children as well, who play chess but they\u2019re 10 and eight. They\u2019ll be right sometimes and not right other times. There\u2019s noise in that, and some of the noise is spam. One also has to have careful regard for privacy issues.\u201d", "By collecting enormous amounts of data, Google hopes to create a powerful database that eventually will understand the relationship between words (for example, \u2018a dog is an animal\u2019 and \u2018a dog has four legs\u2019). The challenge is to try to establish these relationships automatically, using tons of information, instead of having experts teach the system. This database would then improve search results and language translations because it would have a better understanding of the meaning of the words.", "\u201cI\u2019m very excited about the prospect of computers becoming more intelligent. It revolutionises the role of computation in day-to-day life\u201d", "There\u2019s also a lot of research around \u2018conceptual search\u2019. \u201cLet\u2019s take a video of a couple in front of the Empire State Building. We watch the video and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re on their honeymoon. But what is the video about? Is it about love or honeymoons, or is it about renting office space? It\u2019s a fundamentally challenging problem.\u201d", "One example of conceptual search is Google Image Swirl, which was added to Labs in November. Enter a keyword and you get a list of 12 images; clicking on each one brings up a cluster of related pictures. Click on any of them to expand the \u2018wonder wheel\u2019 further. Google notes that they\u2019re not just the most relevant images; the algorithm determines the most relevant group of images with similar appearance and meaning.", "To improve the world\u2019s data, Google continues to focus on the importance of the open internet. Another Labs project, Google Fusion Tables facilitates data management in the cloud. It enables users to create tables, filter and aggregate data, merge it with other data sources and visualise it with Google Maps or the Google Visualisation API. The data sets can then be published, shared or kept private and commented on by people around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of open collaboration,\u201d Spector says. \u201cIf it\u2019s public, we can crawl it to make it searchable and easily visible to people. We hired one of the best database researchers in the world, Alon Halevy, to lead it.\u201d", "Google is aiming to make more information available more easily across multiple devices, whether it\u2019s images, videos, speech or maps, no matter which language we\u2019re using. Spector calls the impact \u201ctotally transparent processing \u2014 it revolutionises the role of computation in day-today life. The computer can break down all these barriers to communication and knowledge. No matter what device we\u2019re using, we have access to things. We can do translations, there are books or government documents, and some day we hope to have medical records. Whatever you want, no matter where you are, you can find it.\u201d", "Spector retired in early 2015 and now serves as the CTO of Two Sigma Investments", "This article originally appeared in issue 198 of .net magazine in 2010 and was republished at www.techradar.com.
