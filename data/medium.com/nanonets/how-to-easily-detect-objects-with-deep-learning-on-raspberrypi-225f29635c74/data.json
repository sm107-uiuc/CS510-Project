The human brain has 30% of it\u2019s Neurons work on processing vision (as compared with 8 percent for touch and just 3 percent for hearing). Humans have two major advantages when compared with machines. One is stereoscopic vision, the second is an almost infinite supply of training data (an infant of 5 years has had approximately 2.7B Images sampled at 30fps).", "To mimic human level performance scientists broke down the visual perception task into four different categories.", "Object detection has been good enough for a variety of applications (even though image segmentation is a much more precise result, it suffers from the complexity of creating training data. It typically takes a human annotator 12x more time to segment an image than draw bounding boxes; this is more anecdotal and lacks a source). Also, after detecting objects, it is separately possible to segment the object from the bounding box.", "Object detection is of significant practical importance and has been used across a variety of industries. Some of the examples are mentioned below:", "Object Detection can be used to answer a variety of questions. These are the broad categories:", "There are a variety of models/architectures that are used for object detection. Each with trade-offs between speed, size, and accuracy.

Almost all of that size is taken up with the weights for the neural connections, since there are often many millions of these in a single model.", "The Nodes and Weights of a neural network are originally stored as 32-bit floating point numbers.
