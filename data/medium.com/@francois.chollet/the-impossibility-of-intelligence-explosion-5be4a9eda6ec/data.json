J. Good described for the first time the notion of \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d, as it relates to artificial intelligence (AI):", "Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \u201cintelligence explosion,\u201d and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.", "Decades later, the concept of an \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d \u2014 leading to the sudden rise of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d and the accidental end of the human race \u2014 has taken hold in the AI community. Famous business leaders are casting it as a major risk, greater than nuclear war or climate change. Average graduate students in machine learning are endorsing it. In a 2015 email survey targeting AI researchers, 29% of respondents answered that intelligence explosion was \u201clikely\u201d or \u201chighly likely\u201d. A further 21% considered it a serious possibility.", "The basic premise is that, in the near future, a first \u201cseed AI\u201d will be created, with general problem-solving abilities slightly surpassing that of humans. This seed AI would start designing better AIs, initiating a recursive self-improvement loop that would immediately leave human intelligence in the dust, overtaking it by orders of magnitude in a short time. Proponents of this theory also regard intelligence as a kind of superpower, conferring its holders with almost supernatural capabilities to shape their environment \u2014 as seen in the science-fiction movie Transcendence (2014), for instance. Superintelligence would thus imply near-omnipotence, and would pose an existential threat to humanity.", "This science-fiction narrative contributes to the dangerously misleading public debate that is ongoing about the risks of AI and the need for AI regulation. In this post, I argue that intelligence explosion is impossible \u2014 that the notion of intelligence explosion comes from a profound misunderstanding of both the nature of intelligence and the behavior of recursively self-augmenting systems. I attempt to base my points on concrete observations about intelligent systems and recursive systems.", "The reasoning behind intelligence explosion, like many of the early theories about AI that arose in the 1960s and 1970s, is sophistic: it considers \u201cintelligence\u201d in a completely abstract way, disconnected from its context, and ignores available evidence about both intelligent systems and recursively self-improving systems. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We are, after all, on a planet that is literally packed with intelligent systems (including us) and self-improving systems, so we can simply observe them and learn from them to answer the questions at hand, instead of coming up with evidence-free circular reasonings.", "To talk about intelligence and its possible self-improving properties, we should first introduce necessary background and context. What are we talking about when we talk about intelligence? Precisely defining intelligence is in itself a challenge. The intelligence explosion narrative equates intelligence with the general problem-solving ability displayed by individual intelligent agents \u2014 by current human brains, or future electronic brains. This is not quite the full picture, so let\u2019s use this definition as a starting point, and expand on it.", "The first issue I see with the intelligence explosion theory is a failure to recognize that intelligence is necessarily part of a broader system \u2014 a vision of intelligence as a \u201cbrain in jar\u201d that can be made arbitrarily intelligent independently of its situation. A brain is just a piece of biological tissue, there is nothing intrinsically intelligent about it. Beyond your brain, your body and senses \u2014 your sensorimotor affordances \u2014 are a fundamental part of your mind. Your environment is a fundamental part of your mind. Human culture is a fundamental part of your mind. These are, after all, where all of your thoughts come from. You cannot dissociate intelligence from the context in which it expresses itself.", "In particular, there is no such thing as \u201cgeneral\u201d intelligence. On an abstract level, we know this for a fact via the \u201cno free lunch\u201d theorem \u2014 stating that no problem-solving algorithm can outperform random chance across all possible problems. If intelligence is a problem-solving algorithm, then it can only be understood with respect to a specific problem. In a more concrete way, we can observe this empirically in that all intelligent systems we know are highly specialized. The intelligence of the AIs we build today is hyper specialized in extremely narrow tasks \u2014 like playing Go, or classifying images into 10,000 known categories. The intelligence of an octopus is specialized in the problem of being an octopus. The intelligence of a human is specialized in the problem of being human.", "What would happen if we were to put a freshly-created human brain in the body of an octopus, and let in live at the bottom of the ocean? Would it even learn to use its eight-legged body? Would it survive past a few days? We cannot perform this experiment, but we do know that cognitive development in humans and animals is driven by hardcoded, innate dynamics. Human babies are born with an advanced set of reflex behaviors and innate learning templates that drive their early sensorimotor development, and that are fundamentally intertwined with the structure of the human sensorimotor space. The brain has hardcoded conceptions of having a body with hands that can grab, a mouth that can suck, eyes mounted on a moving head that can be used to visually follow objects (the vestibulo-ocular reflex), and these preconceptions are required for human intelligence to start taking control of the human body. It has even been convincingly argued, for instance by Chomsky, that very high-level human cognitive features, such as our ability to develop language, are innate.", "Similarly, one can imagine that the octopus has its own set of hardcoded cognitive primitives required in order to learn how to use an octopus body and survive in its octopus environment. The brain of a human is hyper specialized in the human condition \u2014 an innate specialization extending possibly as far as social behaviors, language, and common sense \u2014 and the brain of an octopus would likewise be hyper specialized in octopus behaviors. A human baby brain properly grafted in an octopus body would most likely fail to adequately take control of its unique sensorimotor space, and would quickly die off. Not so smart now, Mr. Superior Brain.", "What would happen if we were to put a human \u2014 brain and body \u2014 into an environment that does not feature human culture as we know it? Would Mowgli the man-cub, raised by a pack of wolves, grow up to outsmart his canine siblings? To be smart like us? And if we swapped baby Mowgli with baby Einstein, would he eventually educate himself into developing grand theories of the universe? Empirical evidence is relatively scarce, but from what we know, children that grow up outside of the nurturing environment of human culture don\u2019t develop any human intelligence. Feral children raised in the wild from their earliest years become effectively animals, and can no longer acquire human behaviors or language when returning to civilization. Saturday Mthiyane, raised by monkeys in South Africa and found at five, kept behaving like a monkey into adulthood \u2014 jumping and walking on all four, incapable of language, and refusing to eat cooked food. Feral children who have human contact for at least some of their most formative years tend to have slightly better luck with reeducation, although they rarely graduate to fully-functioning humans.", "If intelligence is fundamentally linked to specific sensorimotor modalities, a specific environment, a specific upbringing, and a specific problem to solve, then you cannot hope to arbitrarily increase the intelligence of an agent merely by tuning its brain \u2014 no more than you can increase the throughput of a factory line by speeding up the conveyor belt. Intelligence expansion can only come from a co-evolution of the mind, its sensorimotor modalities, and its environment. If the gears of your brain were the defining factor of your problem-solving ability, then those rare humans with IQs far outside the normal range of human intelligence would live lives far outside the scope of normal lives, would solve problems previously thought unsolvable, and would take over the world \u2014 just as some people fear smarter-than-human AI will do. In practice, geniuses with exceptional cognitive abilities usually live overwhelmingly banal lives, and very few of them accomplish anything of note. In Terman\u2019s landmark \u201cGenetic Studies of Genius\u201d, he notes that most of his exceptionally gifted subjects would pursue occupations \u201cas humble as those of policeman, seaman, typist and filing clerk\u201d. There are currently about seven million people with IQs higher than 150 \u2014 better cognitive ability than 99.9% of humanity \u2014 and mostly, these are not the people you read about in the news. Of the people who have actually attempted to take over the world, hardly any seem to have had an exceptional intelligence; anecdotally, Hitler was a high-school dropout, who failed to get into the Vienna Academy of Art \u2014 twice.", "People who do end up making breakthroughs on hard problems do so through a combination of circumstances, character, education, intelligence, and they make their breakthroughs through incremental improvement over the work of their predecessors. Success \u2014 expressed intelligence \u2014 is sufficient ability meeting a great problem at the right time. Most of these remarkable problem-solvers are not even that clever \u2014 their skills seem to be specialized in a given field and they typically do not display greater-than-average abilities outside of their own domain. Some people achieve more because they were better team players, or had more grit and work ethic, or greater imagination. Some just happened to have lived in the right context, to have the right conversation at the right time. Intelligence is fundamentally situational.", "Intelligence is not a superpower; exceptional intelligence does not, on its own, confer you with proportionally exceptional power over your circumstances. However, it is a well-documented fact that raw cognitive ability \u2014 as measured by IQ, which may be debatable \u2014 correlates with social attainment for slices of the spectrum that are close to the mean. This was first evidenced in Terman\u2019s study, and later confirmed by others \u2014 for instance, an extensive 2006 metastudy by Strenze found a visible, if somewhat weak, correlation between IQ and socioeconomic success. So, a person with an IQ of 130 is statistically far more likely to succeed in navigating the problem of life than a person with an IQ of 70 \u2014 although this is never guaranteed at the individual level \u2014 but here\u2019s the thing: this correlation breaks down after a certain point. There is no evidence that a person with an IQ of 170 is in any way more likely to achieve a greater impact in their field than a person with an IQ of 130. In fact, many of the most impactful scientists tend to have had IQs in the 120s or 130s \u2014 Feynman reported 126, James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA, 124 \u2014 which is exactly the same range as legions of mediocre scientists. At the same time, of the roughly 50,000 humans alive today who have astounding IQs of 170 or higher, how many will solve any problem a tenth as significant as Professor Watson?", "Why would the real-world utility of raw cognitive ability stall past a certain threshold? This points to a very intuitive fact: that high attainment requires sufficient cognitive ability, but that the current bottleneck to problem-solving, to expressed intelligence, is not latent cognitive ability itself. The bottleneck is our circumstances. Our environment, which determines how our intelligence manifests itself, puts a hard limit on what we can do with our brains \u2014 on how intelligent we can grow up to be, on how effectively we can leverage the intelligence that we develop, on what problems we can solve. All evidence points to the fact that our current environment, much like past environments over the previous 200,000 years of human history and prehistory, does not allow high-intelligence individuals to fully develop and utilize their cognitive potential. A high-potential human 10,000 years ago would have been raised in a low-complexity environment, likely speaking a single language with fewer than 5,000 words, would never have been taught to read or write, would have been exposed to a limited amount of knowledge and to few cognitive challenges. The situation is a bit better for most contemporary humans, but there is no indication that our environmental opportunities currently outpace our cognitive potential.", "\u201cI am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein\u2019s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Jay Gould", "A smart human raised in the jungle is but a hairless ape. Similarly, an AI with a superhuman brain, dropped into a human body in our modern world, would likely not develop greater capabilities than a smart contemporary human. If it could, then exceptionally high-IQ humans would already be displaying proportionally exceptional levels of personal attainment; they would achieve exceptional levels of control over their environment, and solve major outstanding problems\u2014 which they don\u2019t in practice.", "It\u2019s not just that our bodies, senses, and environment determine how much intelligence our brains can develop \u2014 crucially, our biological brains are just a small part of our whole intelligence. Cognitive prosthetics surround us, plugging into our brain and extending its problem-solving capabilities. Your smartphone. Your laptop. Google search. The cognitive tools your were gifted in school. Books. Other people. Mathematical notation. Programing. The most fundamental of all cognitive prosthetics is of course language itself \u2014 essentially an operating system for cognition, without which we couldn\u2019t think very far. These things are not merely knowledge to be fed to the brain and used by it, they are literally external cognitive processes, non-biological ways to run threads of thought and problem-solving algorithms \u2014 across time, space, and importantly, across individuality. These cognitive prosthetics, not our brains, are where most of our cognitive abilities reside.", "We are our tools. An individual human is pretty much useless on its own \u2014 again, humans are just bipedal apes. It\u2019s a collective accumulation of knowledge and external systems over thousands of years \u2014 what we call \u201ccivilization\u201d \u2014 that has elevated us above our animal nature. When a scientist makes a breakthrough, the thought processes they are running in their brain are just a small part of the equation \u2014 the researcher offloads large extents of the problem-solving process to computers, to other researchers, to paper notes, to mathematical notation, etc. And they are only able to succeed because they are standing on the shoulder of giants \u2014 their own work is but one last subroutine in a problem-solving process that spans decades and thousands of individuals. Their own individual cognitive work may not be much more significant to the whole process than the work of a single transistor on a chip.", "An overwhelming amount of evidence points to this simple fact: a single human brain, on its own, is not capable of designing a greater intelligence than itself. This is a purely empirical statement: out of billions of human brains that have come and gone, none has done so. Clearly, the intelligence of a single human, over a single lifetime, cannot design intelligence, or else, over billions of trials, it would have already occurred.", "However, these billions of brains, accumulating knowledge and developing external intelligent processes over thousand of years, implement a system \u2014 civilization \u2014 which may eventually lead to artificial brains with greater intelligence than that of a single human. It is civilization as a whole that will create superhuman AI, not you, nor me, nor any individual. A process involving countless humans, over timescales we can barely comprehend. A process involving far more externalized intelligence \u2014 books, computers, mathematics, science, the internet \u2014 than biological intelligence. On an individual level, we are but vectors of civilization, building upon previous work and passing on our findings. We are the momentary transistors on which the problem-solving algorithm of civilization runs.", "Will the superhuman AIs of the future, developed collectively over centuries, have the capability to develop AI greater than themselves? No, no more than any of us can. Answering \u201cyes\u201d would fly in the face of everything we know \u2014 again, remember that no human, nor any intelligent entity that we know of, has ever designed anything smarter than itself. What we do is, gradually, collectively, build external problem-solving systems that are greater than ourselves.", "However, future AIs, much like humans and the other intelligent systems we\u2019ve produced so far, will contribute to our civilization, and our civilization, in turn, will use them to keep expanding the capabilities of the AIs it produces. AI, in this sense, is no different than computers, or books, or language itself: it\u2019s a technology that empowers our civilization. The advent of superhuman AI will thus be no more of a singularity than the advent of computers, or books, or language. Civilization will develop AI, and just march on. Civilization will eventually transcend what we are now, much like it has transcended what we were 10,000 years ago. It\u2019s a gradual process, not a sudden shift.", "The basic premise of intelligence explosion \u2014 that a \u201cseed AI\u201d will arise, with greater-than-human problem solving ability, leading to a sudden, recursive, runaway intelligence improvement loop \u2014 is false. Our problem-solving abilities (in particular, our ability to design AI) are already constantly improving, because these abilities do not reside primarily in our biological brains, but in our external, collective tools. The recursive loop has been in action for a long time, and the rise of \u201cbetter brains\u201d will not qualitatively affect it \u2014 no more than any previous intelligence-enhancing technology. Our brains themselves were never a significant bottleneck in the AI-design process.", "In this case, you may ask, isn\u2019t civilization itself the runaway self-improving brain? Is our civilizational intelligence exploding? No. Crucially, the civilization-level intelligence-improving loop has only resulted in measurably linear progress in our problem-solving abilities over time. Not an explosion. But why? Wouldn\u2019t recursively improving X mathematically result in X growing exponentially? No \u2014 in short, because no complex real-world system can be modeled as `X(t + 1) = X(t) * a, a > 1`. No system exists in a vacuum, and especially not intelligence, nor human civilization.", "We don\u2019t have to speculate about whether an \u201cexplosion\u201d would happen the moment an intelligent system starts optimizing its own intelligence. As it happens, most systems are recursively self-improving. We\u2019re surrounded with them. So we know exactly how such systems behave \u2014 in a variety of contexts and over a variety of timescales. You are, yourself, a recursively self-improving system: educating yourself makes you smarter, in turn allowing you to educate yourself more efficiently. Likewise, human civilization is recursively self-improving, over a much longer timescale. Mechatronics is recursively self-improving \u2014 better manufacturing robots can manufacture better manufacturing robots. Military empires are recursively self-expanding \u2014 the larger your empire, the greater your military means to expand it further. Personal investing is recursively self-improving \u2014 the more money you have, the more money you can make. Examples abound.", "Consider, for instance, software. Writing software obviously empowers software-writing: first, we programmed compilers, that could perform \u201cautomated programming\u201d, then we used compilers to develop new languages implementing more powerful programming paradigms. We used these languages to develop advanced developer tools \u2014 debuggers, IDEs, linters, bug predictors. In the future, software will even write itself.", "And what is the end result of this recursively self-improving process? Can you do 2x more with your the software on your computer than you could last year? Will you be able to do 2x more next year? Arguably, the usefulness of software has been improving at a measurably linear pace, while we have invested exponential efforts into producing it. The number of software developers has been booming exponentially for decades, and the number of transistors on which we are running our software has been exploding as well, following Moore\u2019s law. Yet, our computers are only incrementally more useful to us than they were in 2012, or 2002, or 1992.", "But why? Primarily, because the usefulness of software is fundamentally limited by the context of its application \u2014 much like intelligence is both defined and limited by the context in which it expresses itself. Software is just one cog in a bigger process \u2014 our economies, our lives \u2014 just like your brain is just one cog in a bigger process \u2014 human culture. This context puts a hard limit on the maximum potential usefulness of software, much like our environment puts a hard limit on how intelligent any individual can be \u2014 even if gifted with a superhuman brain.", "Beyond contextual hard limits, even if one part of a system has the ability to recursively self-improve, other parts of the system will inevitably start acting as bottlenecks. Antagonistic processes will arise in response to recursive self-improvement and squash it \u2014 in software, this would be resource consumption, feature creep, UX issues. When it comes to personal investing, your own rate of spending is one such antagonistic process \u2014 the more money you have, the more money you spend. When it comes to intelligence, inter-system communication arises as a brake on any improvement of underlying modules \u2014 a brain with smarter parts will have more trouble coordinating them; a society with smarter individuals will need to invest far more in networking and communication, etc. It is perhaps not a coincidence that very high-IQ people are more likely to suffer from certain mental illnesses. It is also perhaps not random happenstance that military empires of the past have ended up collapsing after surpassing a certain size. Exponential progress, meet exponential friction.", "One specific example that is worth paying attention to is that of scientific progress, because it is conceptually very close to intelligence itself \u2014 science, as a problem-solving system, is very close to being a runaway superhuman AI. Science is, of course, a recursively self-improving system, because scientific progress results in the development of tools that empower science \u2014 whether lab hardware (e.g. quantum physics led to lasers, which enabled a wealth of new quantum physics experiments), conceptual tools (e.g. a new theorem, a new theory), cognitive tools (e.g. mathematical notation), software tools, communications protocols that enable scientists to better collaborate (e.g. the Internet)\u2026", "Yet, modern scientific progress is measurably linear. I wrote about this phenomenon at length in a 2012 essay titled \u201cThe Singularity is not coming\u201d. We didn\u2019t make greater progress in physics over the 1950\u20132000 period than we did over 1900\u20131950 \u2014 we did, arguably, about as well. Mathematics is not advancing significantly faster today than it did in 1920. Medical science has been making linear progress on essentially all of its metrics, for decades. And this is despite us investing exponential efforts into science \u2014 the headcount of researchers doubles roughly once every 15 to 20 years, and these researchers are using exponentially faster computers to improve their productivity.", "How comes? What bottlenecks and adversarial counter-reactions are slowing down recursive self-improvement in science? So many, I can\u2019t even count them. Here are a few. Importantly, every single one of them would also apply to recursively self-improving AIs.", "In practice, system bottlenecks, diminishing returns, and adversarial reactions end up squashing recursive self-improvement in all of the recursive processes that surround us. Self-improvement does indeed lead to progress, but that progress tends to be linear, or at best, sigmoidal. Your first \u201cseed dollar\u201d invested will not typically lead to a \u201cwealth explosion\u201d; instead, a balance between investment returns and growing spending will usually lead to a roughly linear growth of your savings over time. And that\u2019s for a system that is orders of magnitude simpler than a self-improving mind.", "Likewise, the first superhuman AI will just be another step on a visibly linear ladder of progress, that we started climbing long ago.", "The expansion of intelligence can only come from a co-evolution of brains (biological or digital), sensorimotor affordances, environment, and culture \u2014 not from merely tuning the gears of some brain in a jar, in isolation. Such a co-evolution has already been happening for eons, and will continue as intelligence moves to an increasingly digital substrate. No \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d will occur, as this process advances at a roughly linear pace.", "Marketing footnote: my book Deep Learning with Python has just been released.
