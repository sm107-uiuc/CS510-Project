And in this adorable little video that the IA Institute created to promote WIAD 2015, Abby Covert says that this theme was chosen \u201cbecause of the rising amount of information that everyone has to deal with\u201d (my italics):", "Cennydd, there\u2019s your answer: if you\u2019re a human in today\u2019s developed world, where even physical objects and spaces are soaked in information, you are struggling to cope with and make sense of the stuff. Nearly all the time. And nearly everywhere. Information architecture problems are everyday human problems. So if you\u2019re designing for humans today, you\u2019ll need at least some information architecture skills in order to help them.", "Information architecture literacy is required for anyone who designs anything.", "So it\u2019s not surprising that WIAD has exploded to 38 locations in 24 countries. It\u2019s not surprising that Abby\u2019s wonderful little book, How to Make Sense of Any Mess: Information Architecture for Everybody, has been such a hit. It\u2019s not surprising to see the IA Summit entering its 16th year stronger than ever. It\u2019s not surprising that the fourth edition of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web (due out later this year) is being recast as a book not for information architects, but for people who need to know something about information architecture. We\u2019ve entered full-on mode of democratizing IA skills. Because\u2026", "Information architecture literacy is required for anyone who designs anything.", "I\u2019ll confess to having felt, like Cennydd, a bit disconnected from IA for the past few years. Partly because I\u2019ve been investing almost every available moment of my waking hours into Rosenfeld Media. And partly because much of the IA community\u2019s discussion has pushed far deeper into IA practice than my brain and attention span can manage. But I\u2019m feeling better now, because I\u2019m finding, in my own day-to-day work, that:", "Information architecture literacy is required for anyone who designs anything.", "For example, while I rarely work on web site IA much these days, I am absolutely absorbed in the information architecture of books.", "Want to know what value publishers can provide to authors in this age of self-publishing? The list might be longer than you imagined, but I think most Rosenfeld Media authors would agree: Lou and team pull them out of the weeds, and help them to step back and make sense of their content as an information system. Information architecture skills are an absolute necessity when it comes to framing, structuring, and establishing a flow for a book. (And not just for non-fiction; just ask JK Rowling.)", "I\u2019m finding that IA literacy is also incredibly helpful in other areas, like event planning. I recently asked a couple dozen colleagues who produce events to provide share their advice on organizing a conference. Their responses were generous, useful, and wonderful. But the one I keep remembering most is Jeffrey Zeldman\u2019s:", "A great conference is like a great playlist or LP; every song should contribute, and the order in which they are heard should matter.", "Yes, I\u2019m biased, but I hear Jeffrey singing a song of event IA.", "I\u2019ve been singing it too. In putting together the first edition of the Enterprise UX conference (plug alert: San Antonio; May 13\u201315, 2015), I\u2019ve been working with Dave Malouf and Uday Gajendar to create an information architecture for a conversation. In effect, we\u2019re trying to structure the event\u2019s program in a way that surfaces a latent conversation about enterprise UX that\u2019s been happening in the UX community for quite some time. The event itself should simply serve as an opportunity to bring people together to sharpen and advance that conversation.", "I\u2019m oversimplifying a bit, but we spent months designing our event IA around four carefully-sequenced themes, each in effect a curated mini-conference: 1) Insight at Scale; 2) Craft amid Complexity; 3) Enterprise Experimentation; and 4) Designing Organizational Culture. We see these as the main facets of the community\u2019s conversation on enterprise UX.", "We\u2019ll know we\u2019ve been successful if, at the event, the conversation spills out of the auditorium and into the hallways and break areas, animating the words and faces of attendees. We\u2019ll know we been really successful if these conversations riff off the themes already covered \u2014 meaning we got the sequence right. And we\u2019ll know that we were really, really successful if these four themes keep the conversation moving forward \u2014 both after the event and as the IA for programs at future editions of the event.", "Books have an information architecture. Events have an information architecture. Pretty much anything we design \u2014 consciously or not \u2014 has an information architecture. So pardon me as I repeat:", "Information architecture literacy is required for anyone who designs anything.", "When I got my masters in information and library studies in 1990, our professors were preaching about the oncoming information revolution. Since then, I\u2018ve been fortunate to observe and even participate a little in that revolution. In the blink of an eye, information architects emerged as professionals dedicated to making the pain of that revolution easier to bear. In the blink of an eye, others have proclaimed that information architecture, as a profession, was dead.", "I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s right, nor do I care. Twenty-five years is nothing. The dust can settle after we\u2019re all dead.", "Let\u2019s worry instead about people suffering from everyday IA problems. We, as designers of any stripe, have to help them. And we have to get better at helping them to help themselves.", "Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering why I won\u2019t be at any of tomorrow\u2019s 38 WIAD meetings: well, it\u2019s Saturday, and I have a date with my six-year old.
