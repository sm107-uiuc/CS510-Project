We\u2019re joined by Dennis Bushnell, Chief Scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center to discuss robotics, AI, and sustainable, commercially viable solutions for the Earth, Mars & beyond\u2026", "Dennis, we\u2019re going to be talking about some pretty speculative ideas, so I want to start with something proven: the Mars Rovers. NASA\u2019s had spectacular success with rovers working in conjunction with the Mars satellite infrastructure that\u2019s in place, and even though the focus is on human exploration right now, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve got future plans for more robotic exploration?", "Mars plans for NASA are set up partially with the National Academy of Sciences, which tells us what we should do in terms of science planning. So far, Mars exploration has been more space science than manned spaceflight, but we\u2019re trying to use the what we\u2019ve learned from the scientific missions to inform human space flight.", "The challenge with human Mars missions is making them both safe and affordable \u2014 because it\u2019s a problem to do both of those at the same time. One solution is to send robots & AI five years or so before humans arrive, and let them prepared in advance \u2014generating water, oxygen, habitats, you name it.", "Keep in mind that one of the main costs of getting to Mars is putting the 900 metric tons of equipage required in low Earth orbit \u2014 and if we can build robotic systems to make some of that on Mars itself using ISRU, it simplifies things and keeps the cost down. It\u2019s an solution that offers real benefits, but the current plan is to take a more conventional Apollo-style approach.", "Now, do you think AI is advanced enough to take on a larger autonomous role in these future missions?", "The answer is yes. In terms of AI, there are three ways to approach using it. The first is with big-data & neural nets, which is what\u2019s been in the media since around \u201912 \u2014 but this isn\u2019t the only way to do it.", "Right now, there are several billion-dollar level funded human brain projects around the world that are nano-sectioning the neocortex on replicating it on silicon. This is biomimetic AI, which is an approach that may take it to the human level and maybe beyond.", "The third possibility is to generate AI the way human acquired intelligence, which is by evolving to solve problems \u2014 a process of survival of the fittest, as our brains evolved the capability to solve new types of problems. At first we evolved capabilities on a problem by problem basis, but at some point we \u201cwoke up\u201d, which is called emergence.", "We know the principle of emergent intelligence is possible, because we ourselves are proof that it happened at least once. So there\u2019s that. Maybe we can make it happen in machines \u2014 there are some people who think it already is and the internet is starting to \u201cwake up\u201d.", "In any case, the more data that you give the current approach to AI, the better it is. Even today\u2019s machines can do brute-force ideation by the system level evaluation of quasi-random combinatorials. It\u2019s not AI, it\u2019s brute force evaluations \u2014 but it\u2019s still really good. If you combine that with AI, it gives you a serious capability to handle the unknown unknowns you\u2019ll encounter while exploring another planet.", "Now in terms of the actual machines that you\u2019d use with this AI, it looks like NASA already has several different experiments in the works. We\u2019ve got rovers which have worked really well, and the humanoid Robonaut 2, & Valkyrie \u2014 and I\u2019ve read about several designs for Mars aircraft as well. Do you have any idea of what NASA might be leaning towards in terms of actual exploration?", "NASA starts with \u201cwhat do we need to know,\u201d both for science and for human exploration, and then we figure out the best way to accomplish our goal. What I\u2019m talking about is really a design & planning process, and it\u2019s ongoing \u2014 a work in progress, if you will. In terms of actual plans for our upcoming missions, the best place to find those is on the web.", "The reason I asked was because despite the variety of proposed machines, the rovers have been truly remarkable. As you know, Opportunity exceeded its expected mission lifespan 55 times over, driving a total distance of nearly 50 miles on the surface. That kind of success seems hard to beat.", "Well, look, space has almost exclusively the domain of machines so far. I mean, there\u2019s a few humans up there, but not often, and not many. Space has been automatic, and it\u2019s becoming autonomous.", "You know, on the earth or even the Moon, you can tele-operate. On Mars, however, you\u2019ve got a light-speed & bandwidth delays of anywhere from 12 to 30 minutes, so remote control isn\u2019t an option. The further we go out, the more autonomous our machines will have to become.", "Yeah. Well, and so that takes us back to the AI part and now in a paper called Frontier Technologies and the Human Future: Sustainability Solutions, you wrote about machines becoming our \u201cmind children\u201d. Can you describe for me how this may shape future space exploration?", "Okay. First let me define this term: it came out of Hans Moravec\u2019s book on robots. The idea is that humans are becoming cyborgs. We have cochlear implants for hearing, artificial retinas for seeing, artificial hearts for living, and now we\u2019re even printing artificial organs. DARPA is working on brain implants for soldiers, and the idea of uploading human minds into machines has gone from being science fiction to something plausible. So maybe the future of space exploration will be done by human-contaminated machines.", "Human contaminated machines? Are you talking about putting your goals into the machine as a set of instructions or rules for exploration?", "Well, it\u2019s more than the goals. In theory you could put in your entire personality into a machine \u2014and you are the machine! After all, your brain makes you who you are. The rest of the wet electrochemistry you\u2019re composed of is simply there to keep the brain working.", "So this is big picture then \u2014 you\u2019re talking about changing the substrate that a human lives on basically.", "Yeah. That\u2019s one way of putting it.", "Since we\u2019re talking about big picture ideas, let me ask about the singularity. Do you see the singularity occurring, and if so, when would you guesstimate that we would anticipate to see it.", "The singularity is occurring now, and it continues to happen over time as artificial intelligence and information technology develop.", "Think about it for a moment: in today\u2019s world, we do everything remotely: we telecommute, tele-shop, tele-educate, tele-travel, tele-commerce, tele-socialize, use tele-medicine & tele-politics. It\u2019s tele-everything \u2014 and it\u2019s becoming more autonomous with more AI built into it over time.", "The singularity is where this convergence of digital trends becomes so pervasive that it\u2019s faster than humans can keep up \u2014 but in reality, it\u2019s happening slowly enough, that God, that people are accommodating to it, and largely, they\u2019re okay. So I don\u2019t view the singularity as a single event, like seeing a big storm cloud on the horizon and then being inundated with a downpour.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. We\u2019re adapting to it, normalizing to it, the machine is waking up, but it\u2019s happening slowly enough we don\u2019t realize it. For us, this is the new normal.", "In your papers you\u2019ve mentioned Marshall Brain, who said that we\u2019re creating an intelligent species to compete with ourselves, and also Dr Steven Thaler for his work in machine ideation and creativity. Can you elaborate for me about creative machines that can outperform us in traditionally human areas of expertise?", "Thaler was messing around with neural nets decades ago \u2014 before anybody thought they were worth very much. Anyhow, he trained a neural net, then deprived it of all rational input, and it basically began to dream, just like people do \u2014 producing new quasi-random combinatorials, new ideas.", "Thaler took what\u2019s called a critic neural net that collected all of these streams and evaluated them at the system level for various problems & metrics as solution spaces. This is an area that he\u2019s refined extensively and literally wallpapered the space with patents over the years \u2014 but he\u2019s producing real results.", "Thaler\u2019s process has been used to produce better toothpaste for Palmolive, better warheads for the Air Force, and ideate improvements in a lot of other areas. His work is an example of machines getting bigger & better, to the point where the machine is actually able to outperform a human being at creative tasks. The machine knows more, and it solves problems a lot faster.", "So over here at NASA, we turned the original AI that IBM developed loose on cancer, and within a few years it was doing cancer diagnosis & treatment four times better than a human \u2014 and it was doing it four times cheaper because the machine can\u2019t cash paychecks.", "So AI works for cancer \u2014 but what about space exploration? Well, by using Thaler\u2019s approach of brute force generation & evaluation of ideas, at machine speeds and at machine total knowledge, the machines can review millions of ideas in milliseconds, and come up with far better solutions than humans.", "Keep in mind that Thaler\u2019s approach is not AI, it\u2019s just quasi-random combinatorial production with superbly fast & knowledgeable engineering system evaluation.", "I\u2019d like to switch gears a bit & touch on the environment. In your paper, \u201cWhere is it all going? Prospects for the Human Future\u201d, you discussed the challenges with the Earth\u2019s overburdened ecosystem. Can you tell me about some of the issues & possible solutions you\u2019ve come up with from an environmental perspective?", "For the Earth\u2019s ecosystem? Well, we\u2019ve been pursuing an unlimited economic growth mantra in a finite ecosystem. What that means is that we have way too many people asking way too much of the planet. People are just about agreed that currently we\u2019re short about 50% of a planet now, and we are driving the ecosystem and a deficit each year more. As the rest of the planet tries to come up to Western living standards, we\u2019re going to be short three or four planets. At some point we\u2019re going to have to abandon today\u2019s growth mantra and towards what you could call \u201cgreen growth\u201d \u2014 something I\u2019ve written about extensively.", "Now, in terms of the global climate change, after many years of struggle we\u2019re actually creating solutions now for the climate because technology is finally able to reduce the cost of the renewable energy below fossil carbon cost. Not much happened with renewables until we got the cost down below fossil carbon \u2014 and now it\u2019s going way below.", "Once the price was right, greed came into play renewables are becoming popilar. Currently 33% of all the electricity on the planet is from renewables, the cost of storage & generation has dropped some 80 to 90% in the last few years, and the costs are still dropping.", "So greed works. What I\u2019ve written about are various ways to avoid the huge losses from damaging the ecosystem along approaches like halophytes \u2014 salt plants grown on deserts using seawater. These are useful because 44% of the Earth\u2019s land is wastelands or deserts and 97% of the water is seawater. This is the last natural resource that\u2019s of any size the humans have not exploited \u2014 and it would allow us to land, water, food, energy, and climate issues and make build massive new industries in the process.", "What about electric vehicles? That\u2019s something we waited decades for, and how they\u2019re here. Does that factor into your ideas for renewables?", "Oh yeah. As renewables become a larger part of the electrical grid, using the electricity they produce for transportation will also grow. This is exciting because several types of transportation are now poised to transition to electric \u2014 and it has a lot of cost & environmental benefits.", "The efficiency of electric propulsion is a factor of 2. Now in contrast, we\u2019ve striven mightily to get only a 5% improvement in gas turbine engines, and electric is a factor of 2. Okay. There\u2019s a huge list of benefits to electric vehicles in terms of efficiency, weight reduction, reduced maintence & lower pollution \u2014 and the bottom line is about a factor of four cheaper energy costs to go anywhere.", "There\u2019s another idea that I\u2019m excited about from the Rocky Mountain Institute. They\u2019re the best energy conservation group that I know of, and they have designs for buildings that produce energy instead of use energy.", "I\u2019ve seen estimates that between 30% to 50% of the energy use can be reduced as we go electric. So that could mean we\u2019ll only need about half of the total number of exajoules that we use now because of increased efficiency.", "I\u2019ve also seen talk about renewables combined with conservation making energy literally too cheap to meter \u2014 and energy like that will make seawater desalinization possible for a lot more applications. It will also allow us extract the 44 minerals that are in the seawater out instead of land mining, which is one of the worst things we\u2019re currently doing to the ecosystem.", "In a way, this brings us back to talking about commercial opportunities, so I\u2019d like to ask you about space commercialization \u2014 not just in orbit, but also what you\u2019ve written about colonization & commercialization of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. I\u2019m wondering when we\u2019ll start to see real ideation for these projects as commercial ventures?", "The current planning is what you see. It\u2019s humans back to the Moon after all these years, and humans on Mars along with Musk\u2019s efforts on that. If he\u2019s as derring-do and successful as he has been in many of his other endeavors then it will serve to expedite this process.", "In terms of Mars, you can make just about anything that humans will need on Mars itself, given the energy and In-Situ Resource Utilization. Mars is interesting because it has lots of resources, and as we develop faster transportation, with nuclear rockets and VAZIMR, etc, we can turn Mars in into the Walmart for the inner solar system, and maybe beyond.", "Ultimately the question for commercialization is making money \u2014 and even now, commercial space is very successful. We\u2019re putting up 20,000 to 40,000 LEO satellites to give everybody high speed internet & communications, and there\u2019s also a large market for positional Earth utilities. The question here is how to commercialize space beyond geosynchronous orbit \u2014 and there are lots of ideas and even more unknowns for that.", "For a while it was thought that mining water on the moon was going to be commercially viable \u2014 but we did a study of SLS LEO access numbers, and it turned out to be cheaper just to bring it up from Earth. There\u2019s also talk about space mining of asteroids with containing huge amounts of platinum, but if that was done seriously, it would probably crash the market here on Earth and the price would go down.", "That being said, there are a number of ways to make money in space, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve written about as well. One near-term idea is to use an energized tether to pick up space debris, put into a space junk yard, and then remanufacture & repurpose it. There\u2019s an awful lot of high quality aluminum and a whole bunch of other materials up there.", "Dennis Bushnell is the Chief Scientist at NASA Langley Research Center, and is responsible for technical oversight & advanced program formulation. Bushnell obtained his M.E. from the University of Connecticut in 1963 and his M.S. from the University of Virginia in 1967, both in Mechanical Engineering.", "Futurist & business executive with 25+ years of industry experience and a passion for the future. https://www.youtube.com/c/TimVenturaInterviews/"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url": "https://medium.com/?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/predict?source=post_page-----a875389918b9--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/predict?source=post_page-----a875389918b9--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Predict"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@timventura?source=post_page-----a875389918b9--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@timventura?source=post_page-----a875389918b9--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Tim Ventura"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/19/nasas-valkyrie-robots-set-the-table-for-human-life/", "anchor_text": "Washington Times"}, {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/", "anchor_text": "Mars Rovers"}, {"url": "http://www.nasonline.org/", "anchor_text": "National Academy of Sciences"}, {"url": "https://www.nasa.gov/isru", "anchor_text": "ISRU"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence", "anchor_text": "emergence"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns", "anchor_text": "unknown unknowns"}, {"url": "https://www.wired.co.uk/article/valkyrie-nasa-robot-feature", "anchor_text": "Wired"}, {"url": "https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/", "anchor_text": "Robonaut 2"}, {"url": "https://www.wired.co.uk/article/valkyrie-nasa-robot-feature", "anchor_text": "Valkyrie"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_aircraft", "anchor_text": "Mars aircraft"}, {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/", "anchor_text": "on the web"}, {"url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-exploration-rover-opportunity-mer/", "anchor_text": "Opportunity"}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pank98/nasas-mars-opportunity-rover-is-likely-dead", "anchor_text": "55 times over"}, {"url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/", "anchor_text": "NASA"}, {"url": "http://www.aaiforesight.com/content/frontier-technologies-and-human-future-sustainability-solutions", "anchor_text": "Frontier Technologies and the Human Future: Sustainability Solutions"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec", "anchor_text": "Hans Moravec\u2019s"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_printing", "anchor_text": "printing artificial organs"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_implant#Military", "anchor_text": "brain implants"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity", "anchor_text": "the singularity"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near", "anchor_text": "Ray Kurzweil"}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com/Second-Intelligent-Species-Irrelevant-Cockroaches-ebook/dp/B00VU1DM6C", "anchor_text": "Marshall Brain"}, {"url": "http://imagination-engines.com/iei_founder.php", "anchor_text": "Dr Steven Thaler"}, {"url": "https://futurism.com/the-byte/human-brain-neural-network", "anchor_text": "Futurism"}, {"url": "https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/FR_Bushnell_Where_Is_It_All_Going_Summer-Fall_2016.pdf", "anchor_text": "Where is it all going?
