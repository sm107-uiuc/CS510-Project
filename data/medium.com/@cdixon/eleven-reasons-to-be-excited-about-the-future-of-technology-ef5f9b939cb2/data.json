lived in extreme poverty, and less that 20% of the population was literate. Today, human life expectancy is over 70 years, less that 10% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and over 80% of people are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information age.", "There are many exciting new technologies that will continue to transform the world and improve human welfare. Here are eleven of them.", "Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-driven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3\u20135 years they\u2018ll get even safer, and will begin to go mainstream.", "The World Health Organization estimates that 1.25 million people die from car-related injuries per year. Half of the deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists hit by cars. Cars are the leading cause of death for people ages 15\u201329 years old.", "Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, so will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities, between 20\u201330% of usable space is taken up by parking spaces, and most cars are parked about 95% of the time. Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby dramatically reducing the need for parking. Cars will communicate with one another to avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like work, education, and socializing.", "Attempts to fight climate change by reducing the demand for energy haven\u2019t worked. Fortunately, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs have been working hard on the supply side to make clean energy convenient and cost-effective.", "Due to steady technological and manufacturing advances, the price of solar cells has dropped 99.5% since 1977. Solar will soon be more cost efficient than fossil fuels. The cost of wind energy has also dropped to an all-time low, and in the last decade represented about a third of newly installed US energy capacity.", "Forward thinking organizations are taking advantage of this. For example, in India there is an initiative to convert airports to self-sustaining clean energy.", "Tesla is making high-performance, affordable electric cars, and installing electric charging stations worldwide.", "There are hopeful signs that clean energy could soon be reaching a tipping point. For example, in Japan, there are now more electric charging stations than gas stations.", "And Germany produces so much renewable energy, it sometimes produces even more than it can use.", "Computer processors only recently became fast enough to power comfortable and convincing virtual and augmented reality experiences.

Most of the protocols we use today were developed decades ago by academia and government.

This year alone, hundreds of millions of dollars were raised for a broad range of innovative blockchain-based protocols.", "Protocols based on blockchains also have capabilities that previous protocols didn\u2019t.

Now anyone with a smartphone can instantly access Wikipedia. You used to have to go to school or buy programming books to learn computer programming.

YouTube has millions of hours of free tutorials and lectures, many of which are produced by top professors and universities.", "The quality of online education is getting better all the time.

This is partly because our food production systems are incredibly inefficient. It takes an astounding 1799 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef.", "Fortunately, a variety of new technologies are being developed to improve our food system.", "For example, entrepreneurs are developing new food products that are tasty and nutritious substitutes for traditional foods but far more environmentally friendly. The startup Impossible Foods invented meat products that look and taste like the real thing but are actually made of plants.", "Their burger uses 95% less land, 74% less water, and produces 87% less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional burgers. Other startups are creating plant-based replacements for milk, eggs, and other common foods. Soylent is a healthy, inexpensive meal replacement that uses advanced engineered ingredients that are much friendlier to the environment than traditional ingredients.", "Some of these products are developed using genetic modification, a powerful scientific technique that has been widely mischaracterized as dangerous. According to a study by the Pew Organization, 88% of scientists think genetically modified foods are safe.", "Another exciting development in food production is automated indoor farming. Due to advances in solar energy, sensors, lighting, robotics, and artificial intelligence, indoor farms have become viable alternatives to traditional outdoor farms.", "Compared to traditional farms, automated indoor farms use roughly 10 times less water and land. Crops are harvested many more times per year, there is no dependency on weather, and no need to use pesticides.", "Until recently, computers have only been at the periphery of medicine, used primarily for research and record keeping. Today, the combination of computer science and medicine is leading to a variety of breakthroughs.", "For example, just fifteen years ago, it cost $3B to sequence a human genome. Today, the cost is about a thousand dollars and continues to drop. Genetic sequencing will soon be a routine part of medicine.", "Genetic sequencing generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed using powerful data analysis software. One application is analyzing blood samples for early detection of cancer. Further genetic analysis can help determine the best course of treatment.", "Another application of computers to medicine is in prosthetic limbs. Here a young girl is using prosthetic hands she controls using her upper-arm muscles:", "Soon we\u2019ll have the technology to control prothetic limbs with just our thoughts using brain-to-machine interfaces.", "Computers are also becoming increasingly effective at diagnosing diseases. An artificial intelligence system recently diagnosed a rare disease that human doctors failed to diagnose by finding hidden patterns in 20 million cancer records.", "Since the beginning of the space age in the 1950s, the vast majority of space funding has come from governments. But that funding has been in decline: for example, NASA\u2019s budget dropped from about 4.5% of the federal budget in the 1960s to about 0.5% of the federal budget today.", "The good news is that private space companies have started filling the void. These companies provide a wide range of products and services, including rocket launches, scientific research, communications and imaging satellites, and emerging speculative business models like asteroid mining.", "The most famous private space company is Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, which successfully sent rockets into space that can return home to be reused.", "Perhaps the most intriguing private space company is Planetary Resources, which is trying to pioneer a new industry: mining minerals from asteroids.", "If successful, asteroid mining could lead to a new gold rush in outer space. Like previous gold rushes, this could lead to speculative excess, but also dramatically increased funding for new technologies and infrastructure.", "These are just a few of the amazing technologies we\u2019ll see developed in the coming decades. 2016 is just the beginning of a new age of wonders. As futurist Kevin Kelly says:", "If we could climb into a time machine, journey 30 years into the future, and from that vantage look back to today, we\u2019d realize that most of the greatest products running the lives of citizens in 2050 were not invented until after 2016. People in the future will look at their holodecks and wearable virtual reality contact lenses and downloadable avatars and AI interfaces and say, \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t really have the internet\u201d \u2014 or whatever they\u2019ll call it \u2014 \u201cback then.\u201d", "So, the truth: Right now, today, in 2016 is the best time to start up. There has never been a better day in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/ risk ratios, better returns, greater upside than now. Right now, this minute. This is the moment that folks in the future will look back at and say, \u201cOh, to have been alive and well back then!\u201d"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
