A rock-solid conviction that decisively transcending capitalism and neoliberalism as organising systems is absolutely doable \u2014 just as feudalism and slavery were transcended \u2014 despite how daunting it may at first appear. In this essay I\u2019ll explain why it\u2019s doable, and more importantly, what has happened since publishing the 1-year old article about Project 2030.", "First, a quick summary of the major lessons learned in the past 12 months.", "If we are to consider starting an entirely new civilisation, it might be useful to view humanity as a single species with a common home, rather than individual races, countries, religions or political parties. It may also be useful to compare the various phase shifts our species has undergone to the phase shifts a human body goes through as it matures. So, the Agricultural Revolution signified a shift from baby to toddler; the Industrial Revolution was humanity reaching school-going age; the Scientific Revolution could be compared to teenage years.", "In this analogy, our current species is about to step into adulthood \u2014 a traumatic and emotional time, as any parent of a teenager will know.", "For a deeper dive into humanity\u2019s maturity, see:", "As our species started growing up, we invented systems to coordinate at scale. The first (Western) system to appear was capitalism, which appeared in various forms in the late 1500\u2019s and has continued morphing and maturing to this day. In this organising system, Adam Smith\u2014attributed for evolving the idea of wealth creation from labour \u2014 conceived the idea of \u201cthe invisible hand of the market,\u201d which became the organising system that encouraged and incentivised humans to do stuff.", "In the late 1800's, a group started challenging the capitalist organising system and communist philosophy began to develop in Russia. In 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power through the October Revolution. This was the first time any group managed to challenge the dominant organising system. In this organising system, the state became the \u201cincentive\u201d which encouraged humans to do stuff. Ever since then, there has been a contest between capitalism and communism to prove which is the more effective organising system. Sadly, the unintended victim in this contest has been the planet, as both systems rely heavily on extractive behaviour.", "Side Note: If the daily news feels overwhelming, it may be useful to view the current shenanigans between the US, North Korea and Russia as the troubled teenage years of these two competing systems, instead of being caught up in the bombastic displays of fragile individual egos. North Korea is firmly rooted in communism, whereas Russia is a little more complex. While the communist Soviet Union officially ended on December 26, 1991, communist ideologies have not totally come to an end in the new, capitalist Russia. Putin has been in power longer than most Soviet premiers and enjoys similar levels of power to past dictators. While the trappings of communism no longer remain, the effects of the ideology and the nature of power politics in Russia have a strong line of continuity with its past.", "Here\u2019s a deeper look at the four organising systems throughout humanity\u2019s history: Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks.", "According to Elisabet Sahtouris, the natural evolutionary process of any living organism or species goes through seven stages, varying between competition and cooperation. Species which are unable to move past the competition stage eventually run out of resources and become extinct.", "There have been a total of 5 prior mass extinctions. While scientists don\u2019t always know what caused these extinctions, it\u2019s unlikely that the species themselves caused the circumstances for their extinction. It was more than likely as a result of external events rapidly changing their world (severe ice age, drop in oxygen levels, asteroid impact, etc.) Biologists suspect we\u2019re currently living through the sixth major mass extinction. The difference is that this time a single species is responsible, because of the way we have treated our planet.", "Despite the bleak outlook, there is reason for celebration because we have before us an opportunity to design a more mature organising system, one which results in a giant leap of evolution.", "For a detailed discussion of Celebrating Crisis, see:", "This may be a tough lesson to fully embrace, but it\u2019s by now undeniable that the sense-making apparatus by which we try to understand what is happening in the world \u2014 the network of media communications portals composed of both traditional corporate and alternative outlets \u2014 has failed to help us understand the reason for the tension between the two competing organising systems and the natural evolutionary process unfolding. New tools for sense-making are going to become critically important if this task is going to be remotely achievable. Two really interesting developments I stumbled across during the course of the year are:", "[Edit: As Andrew Ng points out in a comment below, while technology can help us sift through increasingly large datasets, what is really required is an entirely different way of thinking. The required shift is away from areas of specialty towards complexity and inter-connectedness. Sadly our education systems haven\u2019t taught us how to do this kind of thinking, and so rethinking education from the ground up is a critical requirement.]", "The only thing all cultures, all civilisations, all organising systems have in common is our mutual home: planet Earth, all of Nature. Most human cultures have recognized Earth/Nature as a great Mother, and our deepest scientific inquiries are consistent with this view, revealing Nature as an endless source of knowledge and inspiration to guide our lives toward living in greater harmony with her and with each other.", "While the task of designing an organising system that decisively results in a giant leap of evolution may appear challenging, it becomes far more achievable if we acknowledge Nature as our guide. We can learn from ant colonies, bee hives and murmurating starlings. Biomimicry \u2014 copying Nature\u2019s solutions to make superior, non-toxic and recyclable products \u2014 has proven incredibly successful. Why not turn to Nature for guidance in reorganising our social/political/economic systems to create peaceful abundance? The clues appear to all be there in the evolutionary process, but I\u2019ve missed them all along, either by failure to notice, or they\u2019ve been intentionally hidden and it took some prodding and prompting through newly-formed friendships.", "What has become clear to me is that cooperation in Nature, including in human life, is far more prevalent than competition, despite what mass media tells us. Four valuable books in this process have been:", "Any form of incentive results in competitive behaviour, which doesn\u2019t happen in Nature.", "This has, admittedly, been the most difficult lesson for me to embrace over the past 12 months. Much of my writing in the past has been about moving from perverse incentives to positive incentives and I\u2019ve tried to describe mechanisms of rewarding people who engage in world-positive activities. What I failed to understand is that any form of extrinsic rewards strategy ends up co-opting others\u2019 choice-making and imposing someone else\u2019s belief system of what is positive and what is perverse. The kind of civilisation we are talking about can only start taking form if we have totally expunged power and coercion from the way we coordinate and collaborate in the society \u2014 a seemingly impossible ask.", "What I didn\u2019t know is that the human body offers a perfect example of a fully functioning living system, without any form of incentive.", "\u201cSome 50 to 100 trillion cells, each as complex as a large human city, cooperate willingly, without any form of reward. All are agreed to send aid to any ailing part of the body immediately. No organ dominates \u2014 not even the brain \u2014 or expects other organs to adopt their ideology or worldview. No single organ or cell operates with any intention of hoarding or profit. Further, the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) \u2018currency\u2019 in our cells is given out freely by the mitochondria, not as we do with money in an incentive model, but abundantly to meet every need, while carefully regulated to prevent both too much and too little.\u201d \u2014 Elisabet Sahtouris", "What I believe the body teaches us is that healthy systemic flow is more important than individual reward.", "In one of the many rich conversations I had this year, I was reminded that the requirement for incentives is inversely proportional to level of maturity. As an example, my parents had to reward me with pocket money to get me to help with the most basic of household chores; my employers had to bribe me with ridiculously high salaries and business class international travel before I would contribute to their bottom line; as startup founders we turned to investors to stump up a reward before we commenced any work. Now, however, the work I\u2019m currently doing is motivated solely by a desire to give the best possible gift I can to my daughter on her 21st birthday in 2035: an entirely new operating system for humanity. This form of incentive is intrinsic rather than extrinsic, and it is far more motivating than any previous incentive I\u2019ve been offered. Maybe I am finally growing up and maturing (mum are you listening)?", "There is still much to learn in this space, but these new insights have been tremendously helpful in thinking about designing a new civilisation. See Elisabet\u2019s article, from which the quote about \u2018currency\u2019 in our cells was taken:", "The past year has been a richly rewarding journey of understanding the problem more fully. The six lessons described above represent a cornucopia of requisite mind-shifts before tackling humanity\u2019s biggest challenge: an operating system upgrade.", "A valuable lesson I learned during my corporate career is that any complex challenge or project really only has 4 basic steps:", "Over the past few months I\u2019ve enjoyed stimulating, mind-bending, challenging late night conversations about how a new civilisation could be birthed \u2014 not your average discussion topic. These conversations have brought in other points of view, and the mutual learning for all of those involved has been extraordinary. What we have learned is that mutual learning must be designed into the DNA of any new civilisation. Since new ways of coming together only happen every few hundred years, no one alive today knows how to design a new civilisation, so there are no experts we can turn to. Instead, we will design for a world in the becoming \u2014 things will unfold as we learn more. The civilisation we are transcending teaches us what we don\u2019t want and what is no longer useful. There is not much from the old that we wish to keep for the new paradigm unfolding.", "Other living systems don\u2019t turn to experts and gurus and specialists and authorities. Instead there are endless feedback loops where the complex adaptive system responds to consequences of action, rather than consequences of stepping out of line from arbitrarily imposed rules.", "Another key learning has been that a new civilisation is not only possible, if we turn to evolution, it is inevitable. More importantly, this civilisation will be the result of \u201cwe the people,\u201d as we can no longer afford or expect systems and institutions as we know them to come to our rescue. The biggest institutions on the planet \u2014 trans-national corporations, government and intra-government agencies \u2014 simply cannot and will not see a way out of the mess we\u2019ve created. This is a task for all of us working together \u2014 there simply is no other way.", "Thus far, an initial group of three have committed to bringing together 100 unique individuals for an event designed to ignite \u201cgroup genius.\u201d The group of 100 will represent a rich mix of known and unknown individuals from many nations, ages, beliefs and ways of finding right livelihood, taking inputs from many different cultures, some who have followed the same traditions for far longer than capitalism has been around. It is the richness of resulting conversations between these individuals and subsequent design work that will enable emergence to breakthrough from many different vantage points. Rather than any one existing solution being adopted, we will constantly refer to and seek out group genius.", "Group genius is something which cannot adequately be defined in scientific terms, but it emerges at that magical moment in time during a semi-structured group activity when all participants experience simultaneous synapse transmissions and realise the same thing at the same time. That moment opens new possibilities and births different ways of seeing things, and there\u2019s no going back. The process has been tried and tested over many years and is licensed and practiced in more than 45 countries by a network of consultants and knowledge workers. Sessions have been conducted with multi-national organisations, government and military agencies, NASA and the World Economic Forum. The methodology has been described in a 1997 book called Leaping the Abyss: Putting Group Genius to Work by Gayle Pergamit and Chris Peterson.", "The 100 individuals will be specialists in the fields of alternative:", "As complex as each individual field is, the more complex consideration is the meta-contextuality and inter-weavings of how all these aspects work together as one living system. Our existing paradigm and mental framework has attempted to solve problems in each discipline, often to the isolation of others. A life worth celebrating consists of relationships within context and to create a new civilisation, the interplay of each discipline must be at the core of the design.", "Since designing a new civilisation from scratch can be a daunting undertaking, the objective of the group of 100 is to create a global game which anyone can participate in \u2014 a real-life game involving real people going about their daily life, while informing the global participants of new ways of doing things. This is the only way we can avoid biases from a dominant culture creeping in. The game itself will result in a solution prototype: a workable example of an entirely new operating system for humanity.", "Early discussions \u2192 group genius \u2192 game design \u2192 play the game \u2192 build the prototype \u2192 birth the civilisation.", "Some of the features might include:", "In short, our new civilisation will leapfrog all existing forms of human coordination and organisation by taking advantage of the latest philosophical, ecological and technical breakthroughs our species has created to date. The design of our next civilisation is a necessary stepping stone on the journey of evolving to a higher level of complexity.", "While it\u2019s still very early days, the ball has been set in motion and nothing can stop us. We will start a new civilisation. The question is, to what extent will you participate? As a spectator, as an involved participant or as an informed advisor? Either way, our planet needs you!", "The absolute first step is to start being honest with ourselves. As Dr. Nafeez Ahmed so aptly says\u00b9:", "\u201cWe first wake up. We wake up to the reality of what is happening in the world. We then wake up to our own complicity in that reality and truly face up to the intricate acts of self-deception we routinely undertake to conceal ourselves from this complicity.\u201d \u2014 Nafeez Ahmed, founding editor of INSURGE intelligence.", "Some of these routine acts of complicity include filling up at the gas station, sending our kids to school, taking prescription medication, voting, submitting tax returns, debating current realities and many others). It\u2019s no longer sufficient to simply point fingers at what\u2019s wrong. In fact, doing so just keeps us trapped in the current civilisation. All of the powerful energy we might put into resisting the current system drains us of our ability to build alternative viable systems \u2014 a new civilisation.", "If you\u2019re serious about this, read the following essay to learn about the 3 laws of the effective strategy we will need to adopt:", "The second step we can take after we\u2019ve woken up to our own complicity in the current system, according to Ahmed, is to", "\u201c\u2026look to mobilise ourselves anew to undo these threads of complicity where feasible, and to create new patterns of work and play that connect us back with the Earth and the Cosmos. And we work to connect our own re-patterning with the re-patterning work of others, with a view to plant the seed-networks of the next system \u2014 a system which is not so much \u2018next\u2019, but here and now, emergent in the fresh choices we make everyday.\u201d", "That\u2019s what our task is right now. Not to protest, not to demand justice, not to resist. All we must do is re-pattern our daily lives by making new choices in how we lead our lives. It\u2019s not difficult, it just requires a decision and a commitment.", "\u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it\u2019s the only thing that ever has.\u201d \u2014 Margaret Mead", "In 2017, I pledged to absolutely, positively, decisively and consciously commit to working with the brightest and most caring, holistic minds on the planet to define and birth a transcendent civilisation, supported by emerging technology, that benefits the 6.5 billion currently disenfranchised humans, as well as all animals and plants on this earth. The vision is crystal-clear and entirely doable, with the right team.", "This year, I\u2019m reaffirming that commitment. It\u2019s been a thrilling, scary, challenging and emergent journey thus far. I can\u2019t wait to see what unfolds in the next 12 months.", "Michael HauptCape Town, South AfricaAugust 2018", "Many, many people have been a valuable part of this year-long journey, but a particularly grateful and humble hat tip to Gail Taylor (who introduced me to group genius), Elisabet Sahtouris (who taught me about the evolution of living systems), Arthur Brock (who showed me that flow is more important than money\u2014 current-sees vs currencies), Daniel Schmachtenberger (who whacked me on the side of the head about incentives), Jordan Greenhall (who made the connection between blockchain and collective intelligence) and Jane McGonigal (whose super-clear writing convinced me that games are definitely not the waste of time I thought they were).", "\u00b9 This essay was updated on August 13th to credit Dr. Nafeez Ahmed for wording that was not previously credited to him.", "You made it to the end!
