In an interview with Rolling Stone, lead singer M. Shadows says the initial interest came after reading Tim Urban\u2019s article over at waitbutwhy. It\u2019s one of the things (along with movies like Her and The Matrix of course) that spiked my interest in AI as well, so I\u2019d highly recommend reading it. Tim does a phenomenal job of explaining the topic, current challenges engineers are facing, and the very possible implications of this technology.", "The term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d was first coined half a century ago. Fast forward to today, where we have have giant companies like Intel and Apple acquiring AI startups like there\u2019s no tomorrow. It\u2019s not a matter of whether or not we\u2019ll be able to create machines that surpass our own capabilities, but when.", "Theoretical physicist and futurist Dr. Michio Kaku thinks it is possible for machines as smart as us to exist by the end of the century. Google\u2019s chief futurist, Ray Kurzweil, believes such technology will exist as soon as 2029. The band is right in wanting its fans, and the general public, to be more aware of these ideas \u2014 they could be right around the corner.", "I\u2019m no expert, but I\u2019d like to discuss the ideas behind some of the songs and include references in case you\u2019d like to delve deeper. And if you want to read more on the possible future of AI, I\u2019d recommend reading Kurzweil\u2019s book The Singularity Is Near. Although some of his predictions have been met with skepticism, the ideas presented are thought-provoking.", "Simply put, nanomachines are microscopic machines that will enhance us in almost every way imaginable. They\u2019ll be able to help our immune system fight off diseases. They would create super soldiers. This technology is actually at the center of a great game series, Metal Gear Solid. This \u201chack\u201d in our biological makeup will also increase our lifespans. Kurzweil imagines a future where biotechnology is so advanced that we will live forever. This is the same idea behind the song \u201cParadigm\u201d. Lyrics include:", "Engineer the wires to your brainArchitect a code so you won\u2019t feel the painWith your family by your side and vigor in your eyes foreverLive Forever", "The song also raises the question of what it really means to be human. What do we become when we merge with machines? Will we lose what fundamentally makes us human? It can be argued that this \u201cmerge\u201d is the next logical step in evolution, as there is no there is no evolutionary pressure for us to do so anymore. We\u2019ll become, as Kurzweil puts it, \u201cGodlike\u201d.", "I\u2019m way up, a god in sizeBeyond the reach of mortals I shed my human sideFather, O\u2019 FatherI stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?Final paradigm", "Expanding the brain\u2019s neocortex will allow us, for example, to pose questions in our thoughts and know the answer almost immediately (most likely thanks to our direct \u201cbrain-to-Google\u201d connection). We\u2019ll always have witty jokes on hand, and learning Calculus will be as simple as purchasing downloadable content. Plug and play.", "Besides swapping out failing body parts with prosthetics and enhancing our brains, there\u2019s another way we\u2019ll be able to gain immortality. Both Dr. Kaku and Kurzweil firmly believe that the advances in brain-computer interfaces will eventually allow us to upload our consciousness to machines.", "This sounds pretty far out there, and it really is.", "Scientists still have no clue how the brain works, how the billions of neurons form connections that result in learned behavior, or what dreaming is. But once these secrets are known (which might never actually happen) and we know how our brain functions, as well as what the \u201cconsciousness switch\u201d is, the possibilities are endless. To get an idea of what\u2019s possible, check out Black Mirror\u2019s episode Playtest. The brain-computer interface for the game is so advanced that the player can\u2019t distinguish between what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but get ready for a mind fuck. Black Mirror does a great job of weaving technology with a dystopia that we might inhabit, showing a darker side of our society. It\u2019s on Netflix, so check it out.", "Elon Musk sure does. He claims that the chances of us living in \u201cbase reality\u201d is one in billions. I\u2019d recommend watching the 3-minute video. His logic is as follows: we had Pong some 40 years ago. Two rectangles and a dot were rendered on-screen for what we called a videogame. Today, we have games with realistic graphics and they keep getting better every year. Better yet, virtual and augmented reality are right around the corner, pushing the boundaries of gaming. Eventually, we\u2019ll have the technology to create simulated worlds that are indistinguishable from reality. Therefore, Musk claims, it is likely that we are living in an ancestor simulation created by an advanced future civilization some 10,000 years from now.", "The album\u2019s 7th song, \u201cSimulation\u201d explores the idea that our reality might not be what it seems. Think of it this way \u2014 the brain and nervous system which we use to automatically react to the environment around us is the same brain and nervous system which tells us what the environment is.", "I question all the voices in my headAre they mine or have I been misled?Total understanding doesn\u2019t seem to mean a thingWhen you can\u2019t see behind the silver screen, a figurine", "Throughout the song, the \u201cpatient\u201d is having thoughts that challenge the simulation they are living in. They are \u2014 in a sense \u2014 waking up. A darker voice, which I believe is meant to represent the ones running the show, has to reprimand the patient, reminding them that they \u201c\u2026only exist because we allow it\u201d. To control the situation, the patient is to be sedated with blue comfort, a reference from The Matrix, which will make them forget they\u2019re living in a simulation. Blissful ignorance.", "I won\u2019t try to explain this one. Just watch the video. And here\u2019s a quote from that man that might get your attention:", "\u201cI have, in my life, come to a very strange place because I never expected that the movie The Matrix might be an accurate representation of the place in which we live.\u201d \u2014 Dr. James Gates, Jr.", "\u2026but that\u2019s just it. You can\u2019t imagine it. In the second part to his article on AI, Tim Urban compares this to a chimp being unable to understand a skyscraper is not just a part of its environment, but that humans built it. It\u2019s not the chimp\u2019s fault or anything, its brain is just not made to have that level of information processing.", "The same thing will happen when we build a machine with the collective knowledge of some 200,000 years of Homo Sapien existence. Therefore, there is no way to know what it will do or what the consequences will be. Tim depicts our situation with this entity, what he refers to as Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), beautifully:", "Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we\u2019ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is part of evolution \u2014 maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it\u2019s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things \u2014 Tim Urban (waitbutwhy.com)", "Mark Zuckerberg is right in saying we should be hopeful of the amount of good AI could do, but some of the smartest minds in existence are genuinely concerned. Stephen Hawking acknowledges that the successful creation of an AI will be the biggest event in history, but warns it could also end mankind. Elon Musk founded a research company OpenAI as a way to \u201cneutralize the threat of a malicious artificial super-intelligence\u201d.", "\u201cCreating God\u201d describes AI as a modern messiah, \u201cthe very last invention man would ever need\u201d. It paints the picture of a utopia where this intelligence exists. At the same time, the song suggests that we could be \u201csummoning the demon\u201d, unable to control the outcomes. We could just be its stepping stone, as our existence after its creation becomes irrelevant.", "We\u2019re creating god, master of our designsWe\u2019re creating god, unsure of what we\u2019ll findWe\u2019re creating god, in search of the divineWe\u2019re creating god. Committing suicide", "The album wraps up with a 15-minute eargasm. I can\u2019t produce words that will do \u201cExist\u201d any justice. As the band described it, it\u2019s like listening to what the Big Bang might\u2019ve sounded like. Neil deGrasse Tyson makes a cameo at the end of the song that serves as a reminder that our problems and conflicts are minuscule in the grand scheme of things. We\u2019re all a part of the same universe and once we as a society realize this, we can truly make progress. Here\u2019s the full thing:", "\u201cWe have one collective hope: the Earth. And yet, uncounted people remain hopeless, famine and calamity abound. Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war; people kill and get killed in the name of someone else\u2019s concept of God. Do we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us? Each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane, every fictionalized dictator, biased or partisan, and wayward son, are part of the curtains of society\u2019s racial, ethnic, religious, national, and cultural conflicts, and you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers. When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, I see beyond the plight of humans. I see a universe ever-expanding, with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time. However big our world is, our hearts, our minds, our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world\u2019s beaches, more stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed, more stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived. The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment. Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective; a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above nor below, but within.\u201d \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson", "The Stage is an exceptional album, in my opinion. The band\u2019s intentions were for fans to educate themselves, or be a bit more aware of what\u2019s going on in this area. We can enjoy it as a rock album as well as explore the ideas behind the lyrics. I had an awesome time writing this, digging up things I\u2019ve read and seen and unifying them in a way so others can hopefully become more interested as well. And come on, don\u2019t tell me that the idea that we\u2019re living in a simulation isn\u2019t thought-provoking.", "Tap the \u2764 button below :)", "My name\u2019s Carlos and I generally write about personal development, tech, and entrepreneurship.
