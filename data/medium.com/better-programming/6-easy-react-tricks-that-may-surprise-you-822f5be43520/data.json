Over time I\u2019ve come across some simple things that I\u2019d never thought of before and that gave me real \u201caha!\u201d moments. I\u2019ve also noticed that many people I work with are not aware of these tricks \u2014 simple things that can make them happy!", "All the examples below are built around functional components and hooks.", "Sometimes you need to render multiple components inside lists. If there\u2019s no need for a container, use React Fragment. Here\u2019s an example:", "The code above is totally legit but React will start to complain about keys:", "You see the error and say \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d Then you replace the fragment with a div.", "Actually, you were on the right track \u2014 you just missed a tricky point that you may have not have thought about. You can use keys with React Fragment but just not with the syntax you see above. You have to change that syntax with <React.Fragment>, then you\u2019re good to go:", "Sometimes you want to create a component that can be a flexible HTML element. Or you may have seen as prop from CSS-in-JS libraries like emotion.", "Let\u2019s say that you want to create a <Button> component that can render as a button or an a. What are the options? You could abstract the style and create two different components with it or you could just create a component and use React.createElement with as prop:", "That\u2019s fine for a simple component, but what if there\u2019s another way that looks and feels better? Here\u2019s the JSX trick:", "Yes, you can use a string as a component in JSX \u2014 just make sure that the string component name starts with a capital letter.", "useState and useEffect are probably the most frequently used hooks. You need to pass your dependencies to useEffect, or expect some bugs or unwanted effects, but, if your dependency is just a state to use with the relative setState, maybe you don\u2019t need to pass it. Let\u2019s first see the not-so-good version:", "There is an easy way to get out of this situation: Using a functional updater form of setState, like this:", "This one is a bit of a fun trick that I heard about on Twitter. There\u2019s no real benefit but it\u2019s still good to know to understand what useReducer is capable of.", "If you directly return the action from the useReducer then it behaves almost the same as useState. So you could argue that useState isn\u2019t necessary. Here\u2019s the tweet:", "Here\u2019s the code that you can copy-paste and try out:", "Have you ever needed to re-render a component manually? For example, you need to re-render a component but there\u2019s no state or anything that you can touch to do it. Let\u2019s say that, for some weird reason, you want to do it when a button is clicked.", "That\u2019s it! You use useState but you don\u2019t actually need the state itself. You just need the setState function or the rerender function to cause a re-render. The important part is you need to pass a new value every time it runs like an empty object or array.", "I see this particular mistake pretty often. In order to describe, first, let\u2019s take a look at the code.", "The idea is good \u2014 much better than if/else or switch cases. But there\u2019s a problem. Every time this component is re-rendered a new cardProps object is created. Even if nothing changes it will cause a re-render for all dependent components.", "To solve this problem I see that useMemo is used:", "useMemo solves the problem but everything comes with a cost. If you look at the code carefully you can see that there\u2019s no reason to put the cardProps object into the component. Naturally, there\u2019s no need for the useMemo overhead either, because that object doesn\u2019t have a direct dependency on any props or state. Even if it comes from outside you can still use ...cardProps[types].", "As you can see \u2014 no Hooks are needed. Just move things outside if there\u2019s no need for them to be inside \u2014 and the same goes for functions.", "Whenever you think you\u2019ve learned enough you find things that surprise you \u2014 there is no end to learning.", "So, keep learning and be surprised!", "PS: I no longer write on Medium.
