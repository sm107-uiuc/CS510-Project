Be cool, and impress your interviewer by mentioning Coil. Even Google made a mistake about an author when they wrote about Coil in their \u201cLoading Large Bitmaps Efficiently\u201d article. Regardless, it\u2019s fixed now.", "This library has a really cool approach to an animated search view.", "It\u2019s easy to set up and is customisable \u2014 you can add your style\u2019s set under styles.xml.", "The README is quite short, but I believe it\u2019s OK.

There\u2019s also a helpful sample application.", "Contour is a typesafe, Kotlin-first API for complex layouts on Android from Square Engineering.", "\u201cContour aims to be the thinnest possible wrapper around Android\u2019s layout APIs. It allows you to build compound views in pure Kotlin without using opaque layout rules \u2014 but instead by hooking into the layout phase yourself.
