Considering the increased traffic to the post, the visual has been updated.", "Updated July 26, 2018: The anchor visual in this post has been updated several times to reflect new and emerging future scenarios, The current version can be found Here.", "At a recent KPMG Robotic Innovations event, Futurist and friend Gerd Leonhard delivered a keynote titled \u201cThe Digital Transformation of Business and Society: Challenges and Opportunities by 2020\u201d. I highly recommend viewing the Video of his presentation. As Gerd describes, he is a Futurist focused on foresight and observations \u2014 not predicting the future. We are at a point in history where every company needs a Gerd Leonhard. For many of the reasons presented in the video, future thinking is rapidly growing in importance. As Gerd so rightly points out, we are still vastly under-estimating the sheer velocity of change.", "With regard to future thinking, Gerd used my future scenario slide to describe both the exponential and combinatorial nature of future scenarios \u2014 not only do we need to think exponentially, but we also need to think in a combinatorial manner. Gerd mentioned Tesla as a company that really knows how to do this.", "He then described our current pivot point of exponential change: a point in history where humanity will change more in the next twenty years than in the previous 300. With that as a backdrop, he encouraged the audience to look five years into the future and spend 3 to 5% of their time focused on foresight. He quoted Peter Drucker (\u201cIn times of change the greatest danger is to act with yesterday\u2019s logic\u201d) and stated that leaders must shift from a focus on what is, to a focus on what could be. Gerd added that \u201cwait and see\u201d means \u201cwait and die\u201d (love that by the way). He urged leaders to focus on 2020 and build a plan to participate in that future, emphasizing the question is no longer what-if, but what-when. We are entering an era where the impossible is doable, and the headline for that era is: exponential, convergent, combinatorial, and inter-dependent \u2014 words that should be a key part of the leadership lexicon going forward. Here are some snapshots from his presentation:", "Gerd then summarized the session as follows:", "The future is exponential, combinatorial, and interdependent: the sooner we can adjust our thinking (lateral) the better we will be at designing our future.", "My take: Gerd hits on a key point. Leaders must think differently. There is very little in a leader\u2019s collective experience that can guide them through the type of change ahead \u2014 it requires us all to think differently", "When looking at AI, consider trying IA first (intelligent assistance / augmentation).", "My take: These considerations allow us to create the future in a way that avoids unintended consequences. Technology as a supplement, not a replacement", "Efficiency and cost reduction based on automation, AI/IA and Robotization are good stories but not the final destination: we need to go beyond the 7-ations and inevitable abundance to create new value that cannot be easily automated.", "My take: Future thinking is critical for us to be effective here. We have to have a sense as to where all of this is heading, if we are to effectively create new sources of value", "We won\u2019t just need better algorithms \u2014 we also need stronger humarithms i.e. values, ethics, standards, principles and social contracts.", "My take: Gerd is an evangelist for creating our future in a way that avoids hellish outcomes \u2014 and kudos to him for being that voice", "\u201cThe best way to predict the future is to create it\u201d (Alan Kay).", "My Take: our context when we think about the future puts it years away, and that is just not the case anymore. What we think will take ten years is likely to happen in two. We can\u2019t create the future if we don\u2019t focus on it through an exponential lens", "Originally published at frankdiana.wordpress.com on September 10, 2015.", "TCS Executive focused on the rapid evolution of society and business.
