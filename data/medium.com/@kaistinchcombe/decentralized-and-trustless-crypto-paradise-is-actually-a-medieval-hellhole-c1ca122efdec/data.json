future. Its failure to achieve adoption to date is because systems built on trust, norms, and institutions inherently function better than the type of no-need-for-trusted-parties systems blockchain envisions. That\u2019s permanent: no matter how much blockchain improves it is still headed in the wrong direction.", "This December I wrote a widely-circulated article on the inapplicability of blockchain to any actual problem. People objected mostly not to the technology argument, but rather hoped that decentralization could produce integrity.", "Let\u2019s start with this: Venmo is a free service to transfer dollars, and bitcoin transfers are not free. Yet after I wrote an article last December saying bitcoin had no use, someone responded that Venmo and Paypal are raking in consumers\u2019 money and people should switch to bitcoin.", "What a surreal contrast between blockchain\u2019s non-usefulness/non-adoption and the conviction of its believers! It\u2019s so entirely evident that this person didn\u2019t become a bitcoin enthusiast because they were looking for a convenient, free way to transfer money from one person to another and discovered bitcoin. In fact, I would assert that there is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.", "There is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.", "The number of retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment is declining, and its biggest corporate boosters like IBM, NASDAQ, Fidelity, Swift and Walmart have gone long on press but short on actual rollout. Even the most prominent blockchain company, Ripple, doesn\u2019t use blockchain in its product. You read that right: the company Ripple decided the best way to move money across international borders was to not use Ripples.", "Why all the enthusiasm for something so useless in practice?", "People have made a number of implausible claims about the future of blockchain\u2014like that you should use it for AI in place of the type of behavior-tracking that google and facebook do, for example. This is based on a misunderstanding of what a blockchain is. A blockchain isn\u2019t an ethereal thing out there in the universe that you can \u201cput\u201d things into, it\u2019s a specific data structure: a linear transaction log, typically replicated by computers whose owners (called miners) are rewarded for logging new transactions.", "There are two things that are cool about this particular data structure. One is that a change in any block invalidates every block after it, which means that you can\u2019t tamper with historical transactions. The second is that you only get rewarded if you\u2019re working on the same chain as everyone else, so each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.", "The end result is a shared definitive historical record. And, what\u2019s more, because consensus is formed by each person acting in their own interest, adding a false transaction or working from a different history just means you\u2019re not getting paid and everyone else is. Following the rules is mathematically enforced\u2014no government or police force need come in and tell you the transaction you\u2019ve logged is false (or extort bribes or bully the participants). It\u2019s a powerful idea.", "So in summary, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-technology is: \u201cLet\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files \u2014 each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data, and the answer to a difficult math problem \u2014 and divide up some money every hour among anyone willing to certify and store those files for us on their computers.\u201d", "Now, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-metaphor is: \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201d", "An illustration of the difference: In 2006, Walmart launched a system to track its bananas and mangoes from field to store. In 2009 they abandoned it because of logistical problems getting everyone to enter the data, and in 2017 they re-launched it (to much fanfare) on blockchain. If someone comes to you with \u201cthe mango-pickers don\u2019t like doing data entry,\u201d \u201cI know: let\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files, each one containing a hash of the previous file\u201d is a nonsense answer, but \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201d at least addresses the right question!", "People treat blockchain as a \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d\u2014wave a blockchain at the problem, and suddenly your data will be valid. For almost anything people want to be valid, blockchain has been proposed as a solution.", "It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.", "It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.", "To understand why this is the case, let\u2019s work from the practical to the theoretical. For example, let\u2019s consider a widely-proposed use case for blockchain: buying an e-book with a \u201csmart\u201d contract. The goal of the blockchain is, you don\u2019t trust an e-book vendor and they don\u2019t trust you (because you\u2019re just two individuals on the internet), but, because it\u2019s on blockchain, you\u2019ll be able to trust the transaction.", "In the traditional system, once you pay you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll receive the book, but once the vendor has your money they don\u2019t have any incentive to deliver. You\u2019re relying on Visa or Amazon or the government to make things fair\u2014what a recipe for being a chump! In contrast, on a blockchain system, by executing the transaction as a record in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone, the transfer of money and digital product is automatic, atomic, and direct, with no middleman needed to arbitrate the transaction, dictate terms, and take a fat cut on the way. Isn\u2019t that better for everybody?", "Hm. Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When the novelist proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon price, and that the book \u2014 rather than some other file, or nothing at all \u2014 will actually arrive.", "Auditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed \u2014 that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars. If cryptocurrency enthusiasts putting together a $150m investment fund can\u2019t properly audit the software, how confident are you in your e-book audit? Perhaps you would rather write your own counteroffer software contract, in case this e-book author has hidden a recursion bug in their version to drain your ethereum wallet of all your life savings?", "It\u2019s a complicated way to buy a book! It\u2019s not trustless, you\u2019re trusting in the software (and your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting other people.", "Another example: the purported advantages for a voting system in a weakly-governed country. \u201cKeep your voting records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone\u201d sounds right \u2014 yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his vote has been counted? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party \u2014 like the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the election or providing the software?", "These sound like stupid examples \u2014 novelists and villagers hiring e-bodyguard hackers to protect them from malicious customers and nonprofits whose clever smart-contracts might steal their money and votes?? \u2014 until you realize that\u2019s actually the point. Instead of relying on trust or regulation, in the blockchain world, individuals are on-purpose responsible for their own security precautions. And if the software they use is malicious or buggy, they should have read the software more carefully.", "You actually see it over and over again. Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world\u2019s most mismanaged currencies, and bitcoin, the \u201ckiller app\u201d of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.", "Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate funds.", "In the case of buying an e-book, even if you\u2019re buying it with a smart contract, instead of auditing the software you\u2019ll rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the \u201cold way\u201d: either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and trust, the seller of the e-book has a reputation to uphold, you or friends of yours have bought e-books from this seller in the past successfully, or you\u2019re just willing to hope that this person will deal fairly. In each case, even if the transaction is effectuated via a smart contract, in practice you\u2019re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it less transparent, not more transparent.", "The same for the vote counting. Before blockchain can even get involved, you need to trust that voter registration is done fairly, that ballots are given only to eligible voters, that the votes are made anonymously rather than bought or intimidated, that the vote displayed by the balloting system is the same as the vote recorded, and that no extra votes are given to the political cronies to cast. Blockchain makes none of these problems easier and many of them harder\u2014but more importantly, solving them in a blockchain context requires a set of awkward workarounds that undermine the core premise. So we know the entries are valid, let\u2019s allow only trusted nonprofits to make entries\u2014and you\u2019re back at the good old \u201cclassic\u201d ledger. In fact, if you look at any blockchain solution, inevitably you\u2019ll find an awkward workaround to re-create trusted parties in a trustless world.", "Yet absent these \u201cold way\u201d factors\u2014supposing you actually attempted to rely on blockchain\u2019s self-interest/self-protection to build a real system\u2014you\u2019d be in a real mess.", "Eight hundred years ago in Europe \u2014 with weak governments unable to enforce laws and trusted counterparties few, fragile and far between \u2014 theft was rampant, safe banking was a fantasy, and personal security was at the point of the sword. This is what Somalia looks like now, and also, what it looks like to transact on the blockchain in the ideal scenario.", "Somalia on purpose. That\u2019s the vision. Nobody wants it!", "Even the most die-hard crypto enthusiasts prefer in practice to rely on trust rather than their own crypto-medieval systems. 93% of bitcoins are mined by managed consortiums, yet none of the consortiums use smart contracts to manage payouts. Instead, they promise things like a \u201clong history of stable and accurate payouts.\u201d Sounds like a trustworthy middleman!", "Same with Silk Road, a cryptocurrency-driven online drug bazaar. The key to Silk Road wasn\u2019t the bitcoins (that was just to evade government detection), it was the reputation scores that allowed people to trust criminals. And the reputation scores weren\u2019t tracked on a tamper-proof blockchain, they were tracked by a trusted middleman!", "If Ripple, Silk Road, Slush Pool, and the DAO all prefer \u201cold way\u201d systems of creating and enforcing trust, it\u2019s no wonder that the outside world had not adopted trustless systems either!", "A decentralized, tamper-proof repository sounds like a great way to audit where your mango comes from, how fresh it is, and whether it has been sprayed with pesticides or not. But actually, laws on food labeling, nonprofit or government inspectors, an independent, trusted free press, empowered workers who trust whistleblower protections, credible grocery stores, your local nonprofit farmer\u2019s market, and so on, do a way better job. People who actually care about food safety do not adopt blockchain because trusted is better than trustless. Blockchain\u2019s technology mess exposes its metaphor mess \u2014 a software engineer pointing out that storing the data a sequence of small hashed files won\u2019t get the mango-pickers to accurately report whether they sprayed pesticides is also pointing out why peer-to-peer interaction with no regulations, norms, middlemen, or trusted parties is actually a bad way to empower people.", "Like the farmer\u2019s market or the organic labeling standard, so many real ideas are hiding in plain sight. Do you wish there was a type of financial institution that was secure and well-regulated in all the traditional ways, but also has the integrity of being people-powered? A credit union\u2019s members elect its directors, and the transaction-processing revenue is divided up among the members. Move your money! Prefer a deflationary monetary policy? Central bankers are appointed by elected leaders. Want to make elections more secure and democratic? Help write open source voting software, go out and register voters, or volunteer as an election observer here or abroad! Wish there was a trusted e-book delivery service that charged lower transaction fees and distributed more of the earnings to the authors? You can already consider stated payout rates when you buy music or books, buy directly from the authors, or start your own e-book site that\u2019s even better than what\u2019s out there!", "Projects based on the elimination of trust have failed to capture customers\u2019 interest because trust is actually so damn valuable. A lawless and mistrustful world where self-interest is the only principle and paranoia is the only source of safety is a not a paradise but a crypto-medieval hellhole.", "As a society, and as technologists and entrepreneurs in particular, we\u2019re going to have to get good at cooperating \u2014 at building trust, and, at being trustworthy. Instead of directing resources to the elimination of trust, we should direct our resources to the creation of trust\u2014whether we use a long series of sequentially hashed files as our storage medium or not.", "Kai Stinchcombe coined the terms \u201ccrypto-medieval\u201d \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d and \u201csmart mango.\u201d Please use freely: coining terms makes you a futurist.",
