A particularly interesting class of algorithms are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).", "RNN is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behaviour. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.", "Sign up for the Newsletter for more experiments like this!", "Recently Andrej Karpathy, a CS PhD student at Stanford has released char-rnn, a Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks for character-level language models.
