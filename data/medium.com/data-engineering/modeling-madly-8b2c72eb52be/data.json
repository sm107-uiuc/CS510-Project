You can see my summary of one of our previous hackathons here. These past two hackathons I\u2019ve taken on some slightly different challenges than people usually go after in a hackathon: developing new machine learning models. While I\u2018ve been working on data science and machine learning systems for a while, I\u2019ve found that trying to do so under extreme constraints can be a distinctly different experience. A very good data hacker can easily find themselves with a great idea at a hackathon but with little to nothing to demo at the end. Accepting that my personal experience is just my own, let me offer three tips for building new models at a hackathon.", "When you\u2019re doing a more traditional web app hack at a hackathon, you can almost run out of time and still come up with something pretty good as long as you get that last bug fixed before the demo. This is a great characteristic to build into the plan of a hack but one that simply does not apply to a machine learning hack.", "Think about what happens when you do find that last bug in a machine learning project. You still need to potentially do all of the below:", "That\u2019s no \u201cjust hit refresh\u201d workflow. Even with a well-oiled workflow, some of those tasks can take all of the time your average one-day hackathon is scheduled for. Take #3, for example. Training a production grade model using, say, Hadoop, can take a lot of time, even if you have the cash to spin up a fair-sized cluster of EC2 instances.", "What that means for your hack can vary, but you\u2019re just asking for trouble if you don\u2019t start with that fact taken into account in the scope and goals of your project. A solid project design is absolutely crucial, if you\u2019re going to hope to take all of the little steps involved in getting your model ready to demo.", "Which leads me to my next point\u2026", "One of the best things about working in data science is all of the really smart people. But, of course, the corollary is that one of the worst things about working in data science is all of the really smart people. Sharp engineers and data scientists can take the nugget of an idea and envision a useful, powerful suite of products that would take years to build, which is not so useful when you have a day or two. Mature dataists know just how much ambition is too much and plan accordingly. I happen to be lucky enough to work with some very smart and very mature data scientists and engineers, so this has not been a problem for either of my last few hacks. But, I\u2019m just lucky that way. You might not be so lucky.", "Unrealistic ambitions are a constant danger in a machine learning hack, running along the edge of all activities like a precipice beckoning you to dive off and see where you land. If you take one thing away from this post, let it be this: don\u2019t dive off the cliff. Just don\u2019t do it. You won\u2019t like where you land. You\u2019ll wind up with more questions than answers and you\u2019ll have nothing to show come demo time. Moreover, your fellow devs who worked on apps and not models will simply not understand what you spent your time on.", "What does a precipice look like? It could be a novel distance metric. It could be a fundamental improvement to a widely used technique like SVRs. Or it could just be something really benign sounding like a longer training set. I would say that even choosing to pose the problem as a regression one instead of a classification one could qualify.", "The danger originates in the intrinsic tension between the rigorous and exploratory mode of academic data science/machine learning education and the pedal-to-the-metal pace mandated by a hackathon. They are very different modes of working, and you\u2019re just going to have suspend some of your good habits for a day or so, if you want to have something to demo.", "This last point can be the trickiest to put in practice, but I think it can totally be the difference between a project that feels like a hack and one that feels like just getting warmed up on a weeklong story. If you\u2019ve figured out how to scope your project appropriately and designed something that can really be built in a day or two, you can still actually fail to do so. I think it can the difference can easily come down to technology choices.", "For example, I currently make my living writing Cascalog, Clojure, and Java on top of Hadoop to process files stored in S3. I know these tools well enough to pay my rent, but I would absolutely hesitate to use any of them in a tight-paced context. I have spent weeks trying to understand a single Cascalog bug. Seriously.", "If you know the language, Python offers an unbeatable value proposition for this use case. scikit-learn has nearly everything you could imagine needing. pandas, NumPy, and SciPy are all sitting there to be brought in when appropriate. And don\u2019t forget how awesome it can be to prototype in a purpose-built exploratory development environment like IPython.", "But this is machine learning, and sometimes our data is just big. Maybe even web scale. Some people hate these phrases, but they serve a purpose. We don\u2019t all use Hadoop out of love for horrendously complex Java applications.", "Big data is not just statistics on a Mac Pro, although it can often look like that. Scale can be a real necessity even in a hackathon.", "When it is, there are no easy answers. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe you can actually work with multiple hour model learning times. If you\u2019re really lucky, you might be using Spark and not Hadoop, in which case it might not take hours to learn your model.", "My point is that, insofar as you have a choice, choose the leaner meaner tool, the one that will let you do more with less input required from you. Don\u2019t use that C++ library that promises awesome runtime but with Python bindings that you\u2019ve never tried. You\u2019ll never figure out its quirks in time. Write as little data cleanup code as you can manage. Commands like dropna can save you precious minutes to hours. And if you can get your data from database or an API instead of files, then, for the love of Cthulhu, do it. Hell, even if you have to load your data from files to a database first, it might be worth your time. SQL is one of the highest productivity rapid prototyping tools I know.", "And though I love to bash on the clunkiness of Hadoop, there are even ways of taking some serious pain out of using it under pressure. Depending on what you\u2019re doing Elastic Map Reduce or PredictionIO can get you to the point of being productive much faster.", "I love hackathons and their variations. They remind me of the fun old days in grad school, furiously hacking away to come up with something interesting to say about definitionally uncertain stuff.", "The furious pace and the pragmatic compromises are part of the fun. Compared to things like pitch events, hackathons have way less problems (even if they have their issues as well). At their best they\u2019re about the love of unconstrained creation. I\u2019ve tried to do machine learning hacks because it\u2019s just so damn cool to go from zero to having a program that makes decisions. It amazes me every time it works, and doubly so when I can manage to get something working on a deadline.", "Taking on a challenge like building a new model in a hackathon is also a great learning experience, especially if you get to work as part of a strong team. Machine learning in the real world is an even larger topic than its academic cousin, and there\u2019s always interesting things to learn. Hackathons can be great places to rapidly iterate through approaches and learn from your teammates how to build things better and faster. That\u2019s pretty likely to come in handy sometime.", "The main part of the post is over, but I wanted to make sure to leave a note for anyone who was interested in what we hack at Intent Media (or what we build for our customers). We\u2019re hiring all sorts of smart people to build systems for machine learning and more.
