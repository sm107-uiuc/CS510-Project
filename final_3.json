It should be clear from the title that this is an elite role. Some innovative companies have even started using the title u201cSenior Data Manageru201d to attract the right candidates in 2025. PDSs are charged with the mission of leveraging their strengths in ML to solve the hardest artificial intelligence problems facing tech companies. For example, social media companies are still searching for the perfect autonomous content moderating technologies. And only PDSs can help them. PDSs are uniquely suited to solve such problems due to their advanced training. For example, PDSs advancing the state-of-the-art in comment moderations have each completed a Ph.D. in digital anthropological communication with ML applications. In their training, theyu2019ve each received five days of in-person lectures on such complex topics as meme quality and whether or not a comment counts as a hateful or if it was just meant ironically. Further, in the second week of their boot camp, they each complete an independent ML-research project and write a three-paragraph thesis. On the last day, everyone in the class gets to defend their thesis and pick up their Ph.D. certificate. In 2019, we might struggle to see how one could complete such an advanced ML project in only one week despite no prior experience. Isnu2019t ML still hard? Well, of course, itu2019s still hard! Thatu2019s why we need PDSs. And theyu2019re certainly experts in ML. Theyu2019ve each read the 80-page Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) manual provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). (Donu2019t be intimidatedu00a0byu00a0thisu00a0longu00a0book, itu2019s only a picture book. Or, as one might say, a slide deck.) Hence, each PDS has mastered this technology and therefore knows how to click through the ML wizard u2014 always accepting the default settings u2014 and finally, click the big u201cRun Machine Learning!!!u201d button. (Yes, Google added the exclamation points in response to overwhelming customer feedback.) But their expertise in ML alone are insufficient for them to solve such challenging artificial intelligence problems. For as every PDS knows, ML applied to poorly prepared data is useless. Hence, PDSs also need deep expertise in their problem domain so as to properly prepare their data. Their specialized graduate coursework trains them accordingly. Further, PDSs are experts at leveraging data microscopes. These are advanced technologies that allow their highly-technical users to explore the structure of data and annotate data elements. For example, a PDS specialized in comment moderation knows how to discover flagged comments by clicking the appropriate tab in their data microscope. They then apply their professional judgment in annotating individual comments with the right labels. After roughly a week, theyu2019ve prepared sufficient data (averaging 2k comments/day) to start applying state-of-the-art ML methods. In 2025, running MLaaS on GCP takes on average 4 minutes and costs $7.21. A newly minted PDS Ph.D. may think this is where the project ends. But as any veteran knows, no ML solution is perfect on the first try. Instead, real-world data science is an iterative loop whereby we constantly improve the methods through user feedback. One might call this u201corganic reinforcement learningu201d whereby users of a platform let the PDS know where the AI methods are currently failing by contesting ML-predicted labels. In an attempt to improve the ML performance, some junior PDSs may be tempted to play with the MLaaS settings in GCPu200au2014u200athinking they can do ML better than Googleu200au2014u200abut they soon find this to be in vain. For our God, Google, is omnipotent in the domain of ML. Instead, the problem is always insufficient prepared data. Back to the microscope! And remember, donu2019t hit that u201cRun Machine Learning!!!u201d button more than once a week; it costs us real money. As you might imagine, PDSs are well-compensated professionals in 2025. They average $18/hr and the top contractors can make north of $32/hr. These top professionals are chiefly distinguished by their emotional fortitude in such soul-racking domains as identifying child pornography. Hence, the big bucks. Like dentists before them, these professionals exhibit a statistically-significant higher rate of depression. Too bad they donu2019t know statistics. Look out for part II where we consider how large teams of PDSs are coordinated to collaboratively tackle massive artificial intelligence problems in 2025. Spoiler: coordinating and managing PDSs is such a crummy job that only computers are willing to do it.
